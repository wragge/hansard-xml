<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a result of the complete backdown, the legislation has now proceeded through the House and through the Senate. Work for the dole projects can now proceed. The government will be issuing the final guidelines for these projects in July and inviting project proposals from communities around Australia. We will be looking to sign contracts during September and the first projects will commence in October. It is no wonder that the opposition leader is slumped forward in his chair. He is exhausted after the acrobatics of the last 24 hours. I think he would make Nadia Comaneci look clumsy with that backflip we saw last night.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer gives him nine, but I give him 10. He gets 10 for that backflip last night. It was the biggest backflip we have seen in a very long time. You wonder what happened over the last weekend. What happened? Did he start to talk to young Australians? Did he find out that Australians want work for the dole? Young people want work for the dole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was one of the weakest performances we have ever seen from a Leader of the Opposition. He led them straight into the blind alley. He led them straight out again, in one of the most humiliating backdowns we have seen in a very long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The communities around Australia will now be very pleased to know that the imaginative proposals that they are putting in place to help young people can now become reality. Young, long-term unemployed people, 18 to 24 years of age, will now have the opportunity to work on valuable projects which will leave something of lasting benefit to their community. These projects will be in areas of high youth unemployment&mdash;unemployment amongst the very people neglected by the Labor Party during its 13 years in office. There will be some 10,000 places in these projects in the first year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This marks one of the very great differences between the government and the opposition. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6104"> We know that the Two Billion Dollar Man over there, the member for Hotham, did not have any compunction in spending $500 million of the hard&hyphen;earned income of Australia's families on a scheme with a four per cent success rate, that was never trialled, never piloted, and at a cost of $143,000 a job. This government takes a very different attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We take a responsible attitude to people's money. We will evaluate those pilots, see what works best, see what best restores the confidence of young people and give them the sorts of opportunities that the Labor Party denied them. The government's scheme will provide full funding for the cost of the various projects in terms of travel and materials, not capital item, but there will be a fee paid for every participant in those projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the projects, the government will evaluate them and, in the light of assessments, make further decisions about the expansion of work for the dole. The government looks forward to working with communities and young people around this country to meet the needs of the most disadvantaged group in the labour market in this community.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment. Would the minister inform the House of the benefits to the environment of the Green Corps initiative which blends the important issues of the environment and work? How will this have a positive impact on youth employment in my electorate of McEwen?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6104" SPEAKER="Smith, Warwick, MP" NAMEID="GJ4" ELECTORATE="Bass" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Sport, Territories and Local Government; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for her question. The Green Corps initiative of this government has been welcomed by many communities. It is a program which provides the opportunity for young Australians to assist the environment and to develop accredited training opportunities since the scheme began. By June 1999, the Green Corps will have undertaken some 350 priority programs for the development of heritage conservation projects in conjunction with conservation organisations and community groups right around Australia. It is being managed on behalf of the Australian government by the Trust for Conservation Volunteers. We hope that there will be some 3,500 young Australians who will have had the opportunity to have worked and benefited from these projects by the year 1999.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trainees work in teams of 10 and go into the different communities to assist these programs. They are aged between 17 and 20 and have to make a commitment to the environment for a period of at least six months. It is interesting and will probably not come as a surprise to honourable members to note that finding people with a commitment to the environment is not difficult. A survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that as recently as April 1996 it found that an astonishing 72.2 per cent of people aged between the ages of 18 and 24 are concerned about the environment. The Green Corps provides an opportunity for those people to be involved.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6105">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Twenty four Green Corps commenced in March 1997 and a further 36 commenced in May 1997. So there are 60 projects commenced to date with 600 young Australians and a further 30 projects are scheduled to commence in September. These projects will benefit communities right around Australia in nearly every electorate. The electorate of the member will have the opportunity for her community to apply, the electorate of Eden&hyphen;Monaro, the electorate of McMillan, Northern Territory, Herbert&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no need to worry. Bass will have an opportunity as well. The community of the member for Denison will have an opportunity, the community of the member for Sydney will have an opportunity, and the communities of the members for Canberra and Kalgoorlie will have an opportunity. These programs are designed to give the 72 per cent of young people who have already expressed a desire to help through the survey the opportunity of assisting in the making of the Australian environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to see a surprising comment in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> from one of the shadow ministers. Here is a scheme which is endorsed by the vast majority of young Australians. It has been put together under the guidance of Ministers Hill and Vanstone, along with the parliamentary secretary Mr Abbott administering the program and doing a very good job. One must ask why it is that the Labor Party do not support the youth of Australia in taking advantage of these programs. Why is it that the Labor Party do not support programs like this? The member for Batman, in his speech on the appropriation bill on 19 June, said, `Green Corps is wrong.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EK6">Ms JEANES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Could the minister inform the House of the benefits for the young people in my electorate of Kingston from the government's determination to return the budget to surplus and to turn away from the path of deficit spending, which had become the hallmark of the former Labor government?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6105" SPEAKER="Fahey, John, MP" NAMEID="HQ5" ELECTORATE="Macarthur" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Finance" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HQ5">Mr FAHEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the very beginning the underlying strategy of this government was to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6106"> return the budget to surplus. In fact, in our first term we will achieve an underlying surplus in 1998-99. For the first time in a decade, on budget night the finance minister was not required to stand up in this House and introduce a loans bill. In fact, we will be repaying some $5 billion of Labor debt during this current year. We have turned off the debt and deficit dependency tap, and over the next four years we will be retiring some $26 billion of Labor debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean for the young people of Kingston and, for that matter, the young people of Australia? It means that, unlike Labor, we are not borrowing from tomorrow to pay for today. We are not asking tomorrow's generation and today's generation of young people to pay back the loans that Labor ran up to fund their wilful and selfish programs that the Australian community could not afford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next four years we will cut general government debt in half, from nearly 20 per cent to 10 per cent of gross domestic product. The cost of servicing this debt will fall from 7.2 per cent of outlay to 4.9 per cent of outlay. The young people of Kingston and elsewhere know that this will be achieved without any increase in income tax, without any increase in wholesale sales tax, without any increase in company tax and without any increase in fuel excise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the opposition has established a waste watch and whistleblowers committee. From the agenda of this committee, which I think is to be discussed some time today, I notice that they are going to hold a fund&hyphen;raiser. I think that that is designed to ensure that they have some sort of support for this committee to work. I would be very surprised if any of the young people of Australia attend this fund&hyphen;raiser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that two ministers of the former Labor government are on this committee. I think that the young people of Australia, before they contributed to a fund&hyphen;raiser or took this waste watch committee seriously, would want to know that this committee&mdash;over 13 years, the Labor government ran up general government debt from $17 billion to $96 billion; since 1990, they had added some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $69 billion in deficit to the general government debt&mdash;might spend a considerable amount of time examining the waste and mismanagement of Labor over the past 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also might want to know that this committee, in anything it does, will look at what it has done since the change of government in March of last year. What we have seen through the budget process time and time again is the Labor Party, the opposition, seeking to interfere with the fiscal consolidation of this government. Only last night we saw them trying to stop legislation for Australian National&mdash;after they presided over Australian National to the tune of a $1 billion debt and after they had presided over 7,000 job losses in recent years. That is what the young people of Kingston and elsewhere would want to see being examined in this waste watch committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The young people of Kingston can see, more than anything else, fiscal consolidation. As to the policies of this government, they can see home interest rates that have gone down. Young people and young couples in Australia know that, if they want to borrow the average mortgage today, they will pay $292 less per month than would have been the case while Labor was in power. More than anything else, the young people of Kingston and elsewhere know that, through responsible fiscal and economic management under the Howard-Fischer government, their future is very bright; their future is guaranteed.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training&mdash;a very good minister. Is the minister aware of strong community support in my electorate of Richmond for the government's new youth allowance? Would the minister inform the House how this important initiative will provide opportunities for education, training and real jobs for young people. What is the government's response to claims that the youth allowance should be rejected lock, stock and barrel?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6107" SPEAKER="Kemp, Dr David, MP" NAMEID="BT4" ELECTORATE="Goldstein" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Schools, Vocational Education and Training; Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Richmond for his question, and I am very interested to hear of the level of support in his electorate for the youth allowance. That is replicated in electorates around Australia. The government is very much committed to policies which give the right messages to young people, and the youth allowance gives young people the message that a life on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dole is not a way to prepare for the future, that the way they are going to get real jobs in the future is to continue with their education and training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party, however, are now saying that they will treat the youth allowance just as they treated work for the dole. They will set out to destroy the youth allowance. It is pretty clear that this comes from the same people who supported the legislation to get rid of the youth wage which would have thrown some 200,000 young people out of work. The fact is that the Labor Party does not want to help young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A great sense of deja vu is now coming over us, Mr Speaker&mdash;maybe you feel it yourself&mdash;when you hear the comments they make about the youth allowance. Do you remember what they said about work for the dole? On 11 February, the Leader of the Opposition said about work for the dole, `We will amend it to blazes.' How many amendments were there to work for the dole? Not one amendment. What does he say about the youth allowance? In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> on Friday, 20 June, the Leader of the Opposition is quoted as saying that the Labor Party would throw out the youth allowance lock, stock and barrel. He said, `This looks like something that we just reject outright.' You can almost feel the U&hyphen;turn coming right on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And that is not the only strategy on the Labor Party's side of the House. There are other views about how the Labor Party should treat the youth allowance.

The fact is that the Labor Party is in a shambles. This weak Leader of the Opposition is unable to state a view on behalf of the Labor Party, and the view we hear one day is not the view we hear the next. It is time the Labor Party woke up to the fact that young people and communities around Australia are welcoming the youth allowance, as they welcomed work for the dole. It has very strong support because they believe it gives the right message to young people. Unlike the Labor Party, they do not want young people to be encouraged to&mdash;or have an incentive to&mdash;live a life on the dole. They want them to go and build something for the future through education and training.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 13&hyphen;year period from 1983 to 1996, the yield on Australian 10&hyphen;year bonds&mdash;bear in mind it was 7.03 per cent at noon today&mdash;averaged 11.63 per cent. In the USA over the same period the average was 8.45 per cent&mdash;a margin of 3.18 per cent on the Australian bond over the US bond. Since March of 1996 the yield in Australia has been 8.01 compared to 6.6 in the USA&mdash;a difference of 1.4. So throughout the period of the 1980s and 1990s we were running a 3 per cent interest differential on 10&hyphen;year bonds as against the US. In the last 18 months we have been running a differential of about 1.4 and at present it is 0.6.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 10&hyphen;year bond is a measure of inflationary expectations and confidence in the economic future. It is the credibility of the government's fiscal policies that has been driving down the Australian&hyphen;US bond rate margin. It was the new arrangements that the government put in place, with an agreement between the government and the Reserve Bank&mdash;the first time ever in Australia&mdash;with an inflation target, with the ability of the Reserve to transparently make its decisions known, that gave us that kind of credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And where was the cheapjack, opportunist Labor Party in relation to that? Where they always are: totally opposed to it and totally bereft of ideas. In fact, they even threatened to come out and sue the government for entering into an agreement with the Reserve Bank.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance has had a somewhat controversial launch but within just two days the tide turned as people began to focus on what we are about with this youth allowance: providing real incentive and an effective approach to give the youth of Australia a great deal of hope. It is pleasing to see that now it has been recognised by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, in an editorial a couple of days back:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government's decision should be vigorously applauded. The changes are weighed towards solid Australian values of responsibility and hard work. The existing system had clearly not worked.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So this government is getting on with the task. This mob opposite may be split right along their front bench. This Deputy Leader of the Opposition may well be suffering from relevancy deprivation syndrome&mdash;and plenty; but we are getting on with reducing the tax 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> liabilities of future generations by slashing Commonwealth government debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are expanding vocational education in schools, and we have new arrangements for apprenticeships and traineeships leading to real quality jobs. We are providing incentives for young people to further their education and training by the implementation of the common youth allowance. We are giving young people opportunities to contribute to their communities and develop positive work attitudes through schemes such as work for the dole and the Green Corps. We are ensuring long&hyphen;term sustained employment growth by substantially reforming Australia's economy, by building to that budget surplus, and by providing lower interest rates and a more accurate value for the Australian dollar. We are ensuring Australia's environmental infrastructure is protected for generations to come by committing massive expenditure to environmental protection through the Natural Heritage Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a sad side underlying the circumstances facing the young of Australia. It relates to the suicide circumstance in this nation. It is something you do not lightly dwell on or highlight publicly, but again it is something which this government is addressing. I am not so sure that multimillion dollar programs will necessarily turn things around in this area. It is one of the most complex problems facing so many young Australians and, sadly, it results in the death of far too many Australians of all ages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the recent budget the Commonwealth provided an additional $18 million over the next three years for youth suicide prevention in addition to the $13 million previously provided.

It involved some four months of research on his part and drew 95 submissions from a broad cross-section of groups&mdash;science and industry bodies, environmental groups, farming sectors and the higher education sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had asked the Chief Scientist in February to undertake a review of the Commonwealth's science and technology arrangements to investigate gaps and overlaps between port 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6113"> folios or agencies as well as to identify an approach for the setting of national science and technology priorities. There have been a number of previous attempts to set out a national guideline of science and technology priorities, none of which has been obviously successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Stocker raises some very interesting points in his report, some of which are not new to any government. He also presents a number of challenges. He sets out a blueprint for reform of science and technology arrangements. As a key starting point to identifying priorities, Professor Stocker recommends a shake&hyphen;up of the role of the government's chief advisory bodies&mdash;the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council, the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council, the Coordination Committee on Science and Technology and the Office of the Chief Scientist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also covers research activities undertaken by the three major science and research agencies&mdash;CSIRO, ANSTO and AIMS&mdash;and calls for a single strategic plan so as to eliminate duplication of effort, and it seeks a more coordinated effort with the states. As the review covers a number of portfolios and government agencies, I will consider its recommendations fully in consultation with my ministerial colleagues. At the same time, I will encourage feedback from science industry and other stakeholders. I would wish to thank the Chief Scientist for his very valuable effort.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Will the minister advise what is being done to advance efficiencies in meat inspection? What efforts are being made to win international acceptance of a trial of a revised approach to meat inspection based on quality assurance programs incorporating hazard analysis control, a critical control point technique?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6113" SPEAKER="Anderson, John, MP" NAMEID="4K4" ELECTORATE="Gwydir" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Primary Industries and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is very committed indeed to reforming the AQIS meat inspection system. The program to date is to ensure that we do, indeed, have a world&hyphen;class and cost&hyphen;effective system. Broadly speaking, reforms fall into three areas. Firstly, we are pursuing a workplace agreement to change the terms and conditions of employment of meat inspectors. Secondly, we are pursuing on&hyphen;line efficiencies to enhance such 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6114"> arrangements as line balancing, which will increase productive output per worker. Thirdly, we are promoting the adoption of HACCP based quality assurance programs where greater responsibility for meeting food safety outcomes will be placed in the hands of industry under strict AQIS audit arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The project is known as project 2 and, under it, we will be introducing contestable third party inspection systems. At the same time, the meat inspection system is being restructured via the creation of a separately funded and managed meat inspection division. Under the proposed project 2 changes, trials will be conducted in export meat plants of government supervised HACCP based quality assurance systems with routine on&hyphen;line inspections incorporated into each abattoir's quality assurance system. That overall system will remain subject to continuous government veterinary officer supervision and regular comprehensive system audits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is absolutely convinced that this approach is the way of the future. It allows for a stronger emphasis to be placed on minimising the risk posed by chemical or biological contaminants which are largely invisible to the naked eye or, in other words, to the old methods of securing meat safety. Accordingly, the government has sought the support of Australia's major meat trading partners for the trial of the new arrangements. We have been encouraged by the results to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United States has recently published Australia's trial proposal in its federal register where it is open to public comment for a period of 60 days. To further demonstrate the government's commitment to meat inspection reform, can I say that I have made contact recently with my opposite number in the United States, the Secretary for Agriculture, Dan Glickman. I will be talking with him again shortly to further progress the initiative. I am especially encouraged by a similar proposal now being developed by the United States Department of Agriculture which was also recently published in that United States federal register. The United States proposal pursues the same objective and embodies the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> same principles as the Australian trial, albeit with some minor differences in the level of direct government supervision of company performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a growing consensus that the system that Australia is proposing to trial is at the leading edge of meat safety and will become the way of the future for international meat inspection and certification systems. Reforms are being vigorously pursued. They will help underpin an efficient, cost&hyphen;effective meat industry, one with the highest standards of product safety.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That censure motion is substantially the motion that we attempted to move last night when an extraordinary confession was effectively made by the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser). He came into this chamber effectively to correct the defensive letter that was sent to him by Mr Greiner that caused more questions to be asked than that particular letter subsequently, of itself, answered. What an extraordinary change it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had in the censure debate earlier in the afternoon the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) gripping what looked like a lifebelt, saying, `The man is exonerated. He did not discuss anything related to his business interests with Greiner. All that he did'&mdash;as the Leader of the House said then&mdash;`was to come in and ask him for a set of addresses.' It was nothing more than that. No matters were related to his business interests. It was just a cold, hard set of addresses. `This letter proves it,' said the Leader of the House when he came in. `This is the thing: it's game, set and match,' he said. `No more needs to be said about that. It's game, set and match I have on this censure motion as a result of that piece of correspondence from Mr Greiner.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said, `Away we can all go and not worry about it for a minute. Isn't that very nice, indeed? The Labor Party was thwarted and all the rest of it. The bad assault on our Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs was dismissed out of hand. No problems. We are all swinging along happily in the jungle.' As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, `All good little boys and girls together', when asked who was going to be responsible for all of that</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then what do we have? Nervously quivering at the dispatch box, the utterly discredited Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs comes into this place and states, `Oh well, there is just a small amount of additional information I want to add to that. What I was asking him about was a set of addresses'&mdash;so they could discuss the location of a Target store in his property development. Game, set and match, I would say.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you take a look at the absolute plethora of propositions which go into that ministerial code of conduct, whether it be related to misleading the parliament or misleading the public or misleading whatever, seated in the centre of it, Mr Acting Prime Minister, when you answer this particular debate, is a set of words which says this: an appearance of benefiting. It does not have to be an actual benefit, though we would argue in this case an actual benefit is the result of that particular approach. It is the appearance of benefit which is what it goes to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever you might somehow bogusly argue when you stand up in this place to talk about a bloke who owns 95 per cent of a particular set of companies and that set of companies&mdash;at least in so far as one shopping centre development is concerned&mdash;absolutely relies upon a Target shop going into that centre, if you do not want to say that that is an actual conflict of interest, that is an actual seeking of benefit, perhaps have a bit of thought for the word `appearance'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What right-thinking person in this community&mdash;whatever their judgments about what the motives of the minister concerned were&mdash;could conceivably walk into the place and say from this that there was not an appearance of benefit, that there was no appearance of benefit in your code of conduct sitting there at the heart of your minister's concerns about life and that store which will make his shopping centre?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been extracting very slowly out of this minister one confession after another. He came in last week and made his statements about this, Mr Acting Prime Minister, in which he eschewed any notion that this could conceivably be the case, ignoring what Mr Greiner himself had said&mdash;which lends weight to the fact that Mr Greiner's letter of yesterday was manifestly incomplete&mdash;as far as this matter was concerned, when taken sight unseen as far as that press article was concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why were we asking these questions? We were asking them because of an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, an article which he was taxed with first up yesterday. Recollect this: when we taxed him with it first up, he made 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6117"> all sorts of references to the dishonesty of the press and the unreliability of press reports. This is what he considered was unreliable, because this is what we questioned him about:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Greiner, a non-executive director, later said Mr Prosser had asked him if he knew of a contact at Target stores, a Coles Myer subsidiary. His brother wanted to talk to someone about getting Target as a tenant at a Western Australian shopping centre owned by Geoff and Steve Prosser.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the article which he, in his first set of answers yesterday, said was inaccurate. He said that that is not what he sought to do. That is a point attributed to Mr Greiner which Mr Greiner's letter manifestly failed to address in the remarks that he put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Mr Greiner was, in fact, addressing were questions not put: did he go and argue the substance of it all with me? Did he go through the size of the lot, the value of the lot? Did he go through all the detail of all of this? They were the questions that Mr Greiner answered, but the questions were not asked. The question that was asked was: what was the nature of your conversation with Mr Greiner, and did it include reference to the location of that Target store?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What, of course, was the answer three times from the minister yesterday afternoon&mdash;and a piece of his answer last year&mdash;was, `No such matters were discussed.' What was then done was the letter was waved as the defence: yes, no such matter was discussed. Then when he finally was confronted&mdash;and we claim no credit for this&mdash;with the journalists in the gallery who said, `Hey, hang on. We are convinced about the value of our sources,' he had his lackeys up around the gallery briefing, `Well, perhaps something was done about it,' and subsequently he was quivering in this place himself, saying, `Yes, I did, in fact, discuss the Target store.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am afraid that is game, set and match, Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. That is the appearance. We would argue it is an actual, but we will start with the appearance. I do not think we need to submit any more evidence. The appearance will do on that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to you, Mr Acting Prime Minister, and your responsibilities. We notice 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that while Mr Howard is over there&mdash;as he dips in and out of the so-called London convention&mdash;and whether or not he will discuss this, he says to Randal Markey of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, `I am following this. I have confidence in Mr Prosser but, of course, the nuance of this matter is a matter for the judgment of the boys and girls at home.' That was the expression. You are one of the boys of the boys and girls at home, so the buck stops, according to the Prime Minister, with you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we ask you today, Mr Acting Prime Minister: what did you do to get assurances that what you are handling here was or was not a breach of conduct? This is a serious matter, in case you have not noticed&mdash;it has been around the traps for a bit lately&mdash;as far as this minister is concerned. This minister's behaviour has created a crisis of confidence in a very large section of small business, as they attest to frequently in public. This is not a small, irrelevant matter as far as your constituency is concerned or as far as the people of Australia are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did you do? Did you then go and seek to have a conversation with Mr Greiner? No, apparently not, from the way in which you have answered questions in this place. We would have thought that a person acting in the Prime Minister's position would have started at that point, particularly as this flimsy, subsequently repudiated, letter was going to be the substance of the defence of the minister whose fate you are supposed to hold in your hands. No, you did not discuss it with Mr Greiner. You did not seek to ascertain the facts. You did not seek from Mr Greiner whether or not there had been mention of the minister's private business interests or a matter related to the minister's private business interests in the remarks that you subsequently made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having further not discussed the matter with Mr Greiner, you relied purely upon the words of your minister and the cobbled together defence that has been organised by the Leader of the House. Having relied solely on that, you did not go from that point on to ask more detailed questions about him. I would have thought that if you were trying to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6118"> get to the bottom of this, you would ask about the character of the letter that had been sent to Coles Myer. Do not hide behind this ridiculous notion that he has not seen it and there is no particular relevance in it for him. He owns 95 per cent of these companies that we are talking about here. You are supposed to be upholding the honesty and integrity of your governing processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not sufficient for you, Acting Prime Minister, to simply stand in this place and say, `Well, that's an irrelevant consideration. That's a piece of correspondence between a private firm.' It is not a letter from BHP or something like that to Coles Myer. This is a letter from a privately owned company to Coles Myer based on a conversation, the starting point of which was your minister. That was the starting point of it. That is what set that particular discussion loose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you took a look at that letter, you would see  precisely why this fellow ought to go. I would lay you London to a brick that that letter detailed a whole series of considerations related to the development of that Eaton facility, which would leave us in absolutely no doubt whatsoever that the appearance of a conflict of interest had become an actual conflict of interest and that you had absolutely no defence under any section of your code of conduct related to this. But you apparently have not done it, Acting Prime Minister, in the confidence in which you have expressed yourself in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have had your nice little chat with the fellows around you. You have had a nice little convivial, clubby gathering and you have made your judgment on the basis of what they have said to you, when you have had before you the evidence of the fact that his story changes on a daily basis. So you are relying on the word of the man whose story has changed in this place on a daily basis and who has not corrected the public record, which has brought his veracity into doubt. You have said after that and after a discussion with the Leader of the House, `That'll do me; that's enough.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can you imagine Doug Anthony copping that for one minute? He is made of tougher, sterner stuff. At least you would have got an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inquiry from him. Even if you are going to subsequently cobble together your defence, you would have at least tried to move the matter on, tried to put yourself in a position where you knew more than the opposition and tried to put yourself in a position where you knew the facts and the details in full, and you do not. If you do, Acting Prime Minister, we will be happy to hear it in the debate, because you have not chosen to vouchsafe us with that during the course of question time, though I would have thought it would have been, at least in part, a useful defensive position for you to have done so at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The central point of all of these issues is that the people of this country are entitled to be confident that they are governed in a manner that is based on personal disinterest. That is what the people of this country are entitled to&mdash;that ministers are not there utilising their positions to advance themselves, they are not there making judgments about issues that come across their desks and they are not making judgments about those issues, tainted in some way by an element of personal interest as far as this is concerned. These are difficult and serious matters, but governments must confront them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would ex&hyphen;Minister Short be thinking these days? He is probably very happy with his salary, as the sole recipient of the one job that this government has managed to produce in 15 months of government. If he was still interested in a ministerial career, he would contemplate this and say, `What did I do? I was a very minor shareholder in ANZ and I approved a completely routine decision related to one of ANZ's holdings.' And he went, and so he should have gone. It was an absolutely correct decision by the government at the time to send him out the door on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should compare and contrast that situation with the situation of a minister who has misled the House for one week, a minister who permitted a misleading letter, effectively in the context of the debate, to be placed in this House, a minister who ultimately went in and corrected that position and a minister who cannot tell us whether or not, in social discourse with people who preside over the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6119"> planning arrangements associated with the decisions on his business interests, he is having a chitchat, not that we expect him to actually be making formal presentations. But you know how these things are done&mdash;you are in there with the local councillor, Joe Smith, and you say, `Joe'. You get in there and that is what you say. How do we know? You know how these things are done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is not ex&hyphen;Minister Short's situation of a minor shareholder in a minor routine decision; what we have is the man who owns the show&mdash;the man who is actively involved in the administration of the show&mdash;saying to Nick Greiner, `I want Target in one of my shopping centres. I want an address for somebody to have a chat to about it. Who should I speak to about this? Who should I correspond with&mdash;you or that other person&mdash;as far as this is concerned?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you not think that actually sends a signal to the director? We get back to appearance. What is the director supposed to assume from this&mdash;`This man who is going to make deliberations in relation to tenancy arrangements, and we are a noted tenant in dozens of shopping centres around the country, and this minister who is going to make decisions about franchising arrangements, and we have subsidiaries who are actively involved in those, wishes us to have discourse with his brother on the subject of this minister's personal holdings'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are we expected to believe that there is not some likelihood or possibility of influence preceding this arrangement, directly or indirectly? This is why we go to appearance, even if we are not going to actuality. Remember again what I said: those guidelines go to appearance. What sort of appearance is that at a minimum? I would argue it goes much further. That is the actuality of a relationship. That has taken appearance a point further. Perhaps it was appearance in the case of Short, and that is why Short went. This is appearance singing and dancing, roaring and belching as far as this is concerned. And the minister has taken it a point further than simply appearance into the actuality of a conflict of interest. A minister does have a conflict of interest when, whilst minister, he 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> raises with this other person his private business interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you have stepped way over the mark and it takes very little leap of logic for an Acting Prime Minister to see the problem that is associated with it. You expect the media and the public to be morally blind as far as these issues are concerned. You trade on the fact that this parliament rises three or four days from now, that there is to be a six-week break, that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is overseas and that, really, nobody would expect you to be responsible for anything, nobody in their right mind would think that you would be responsible for anything. That would be your response to that, and that is what you hope to escape. And you allow that minister of yours to escape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have erected a final epitaph on this government's reputation as far as its code of conduct is concerned. You have harboured a man who has misled the public. You have harboured a man who has misled the parliament. You have harboured a man who has in actuality breached the conflict of interest rules. You have harboured a man who has breached the appearance of conflict of interest rules. You have harboured a man who has not properly declared his returns as far as this parliament is concerned. You are harbouring a man who has breached every single aspect of the code of conduct, and you expect all of us on this side of the House to dance around and cheer and to think you have done pretty well in your defence of him.</PARA>

Also of relevance is the statement made by the Hon. Nick Greiner yesterday. I will return to those in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6121">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to point No. 2 raised by the Leader of the Opposition, we have the comment that there was an outrageous step of contacting a fellow member of the Liberal Party to make an allegation, which I will not repeat to the House. Can I just make a point in relation to this: the one person on the board of Coles Myer who would not be influenced by a junior minister, ex-member or continuing member of parliament would be Nick Greiner. He is one of the most case&hyphen;hardened ex-state politicians who ever served as a government leader in New South Wales. He would think nothing of a junior minister's status. He has been through all the hoops that you could possibly have thrown at him in the bearpit. The consequence is that it meant nothing. In fact it meant so little that Nick Greiner said, `I don't want to know about this. You put it in a letter from your brother.' That is exactly what happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In point No. 3 the Leader of the Opposition alleges that this all constituted a wilful misleading of the parliament. In that regard we have two statements which were tendered to this parliament yesterday. In a statement by Nick Greiner, the fourth paragraph is absolute: `There were no discussions between Mr Prosser and myself about any of the details about which his brother subsequently wrote to me.' The statement by the minister for small business to this House yesterday made the same point again. They are absolutely as one; they are not contradictory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have failed to prove in any way, shape or form that they are contradictory. How could you? At no stage has the minister for small business had a discussion in relation to the details of this matter. That happily has been affirmed by someone whom I respect and whom the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday he found very believable. The Leader of the Opposition said that there was no reason to doubt the word of Nick Greiner. There is no reason to doubt the word of Nick Greiner. I want to say that, in absolutely adequate terms, I am guided by the statement by Nick Greiner that Mr Prosser did not raise any of the details. There it is in black and white and in no way, shape or form has it been contradicted.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point No. 4 goes to the question of daily work. Yes, let me confess to something I did last weekend. Let me confess that, during the course of the weekend, I actually opened two gates on my farm with my son, Harrison. Why did I open those two gates? To let some sheep out of the yards around the woolshed so that they could run back down to the paddock where they were being housed overnight. Big deal! But what else do I do? I ring my share farmers from time to time. I ring my share farmers, in effect, for a point of contact on heavenly matters&mdash;to find out whether or not it has rained on my farm. Is that a sin? Is that a crime? `No,' says the would&hyphen;be leader of the opposition, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply make the point that we are not going to stand for the moving out of the hurdles to a beyond&hyphen;reach circumstance which would mean that we would have people of straw only being able to serve on the front bench of this parliament. This nation deserves better than that and we are not going to stand for your grubby attack in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In point No. 5 you refer to a further misleading of the House. Once again, the answer given by the minister for small business on Thursday, 19 June, needs to be read carefully, given the hurly&hyphen;burly of question time. But it is absolutely adequate and it has been reaffirmed by his statement of last night. There has been no change. Indeed, it is a very honest affirmation by the minister. On balance, perhaps he did not have to give it, but he chose to give it in respecting the forms and conventions of this House. Full marks go to the minister for small business for giving that affirmation and statement last night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point No. 6 was in respect of his multiple business interests. Those on that side of the parliament do hate people who are successful in business. They just cannot handle someone who started on the wrong side of the tracks, someone who had a limited education, someone who by age 24 was employing some 85 people and showing how small business can be successful and what opportunities you can create in small business in this country. That is perhaps one of the most disgraceful aspects of your attack. It is why you will remain on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6122"> the opposition benches for a long while to come. It is why the minister for small business has been regarded as such a successful minister. Let me quote a letter from the Australian Small Business Association. It is a statement by Peter Siekmann, the director and spokesperson of ASBA. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Prosser is one of the most successful (if not the most successful) businesspeople in the House.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am privileged to meet with the Minister on a regular basis. Mr Prosser has an immense knowledge of his portfolio and appears to have no detectable biases in this area.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is signed by the spokesperson for the Australian Small Business Association Ltd and is dated 20 June. I table that particular statement. It is a very strong affirmation of the good work of the minister for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In point No. 7 you say that he has used his public office for private benefit. I want to make a couple of points about this. Good governance, be it family tax cuts or be it the youth allowance, benefit people, family members, on both sides of this House as they benefit the nation. Geoff Prosser, like me, is partaking in all of the benefits that flow from decisions of the good government and the good governance of this country provided by the coalition government. Is that a sin? Of course it is not. It is not and you know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point was that there has to be upmost probity and propriety in the course of performing ministerial duties. Of course there must be, and there ought to be with regard to the frontbench on the opposition side, for that matter, as well. I notice a list of union members: the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), of the Miscellaneous Workers Union, and the like. They go forward with their representations and endeavours in respect of industrial relations.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I do not think the track record of your former prime ministers or ministers has been at all adequate in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that the minister sought a point of contact&mdash;yes, that is a given; that is affirmed. We now know from the other person with whom that contact was sought&mdash;he has given a formal statement&mdash;that at that point the minister had no further dealing with the matter, made no further submission in relation to the matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I realise the opposition is searching hard for a cause as it works through the mid&hyphen;term blues that it is suffering from.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter is that this minister for small business has comprehensively answered every single allegation which the member for Cunningham has put forward at every stage. He has completely answered them and his answers have been verified by a former premier of the state of New South Wales. The truth of the matter is that, on any fair assessment and judgment, he is deserving of the continuing confidence of this House as Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, as in fact he has the continuing confidence of the federal government and of me as Acting Prime Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again we come before this House with a very serious matter to raise. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in moving this censure motion has done so on the basis quite simply of matters which have been raised over a period now in connection with the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser). As a minister of the Crown he has used his ministerial position in a way which we believe is in conflict with his duties as a minister, has used his ministerial position to advantage perhaps his own business interests and has used his ministerial position quite obviously to mislead this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, I said in this place that the ministerial code of conduct that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has laid down went to very specific matters. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), Acting Prime Minister, in defence&mdash;if you could call it that&mdash;of his minister today tried to say that that ministerial code of conduct has been satisfied at every term. Acting Prime Minister, let me remind you of five important elements of that ministerial code. One:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament or the public.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Two:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers . . . must not engage in any professional practice or in the daily work of any business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Three:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers . . . may retain directorships in private companies only if any such company operates . . . a business . . . and if retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the minister's public duty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Four: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And five:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers should not exercise the influence obtained from their public office . . . to obtain any improper benefit for themselves or another.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As we said yesterday and as we have said today, the basis of this particular motion goes to the very heart of the defence which the Acting Prime Minister brought to this place today. The fact is that, in answer to a question in this parliament last Thursday, this minister for small business once again sought to conceal the truth from the parliament as to the extent of telephone conversations with Mr Nick Greiner, the deputy chairman of Coles Myer, in respect of a lot in Bunbury, Western Australia, a lot on which the minister for small business and his business partner&mdash;his brother, the manager of his business, as he claims in this place&mdash;sought to get some material benefit. That was to see a Target shopping centre constructed on that site; or was it?  We will wait and see on that question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the simple fact is that, the moment the minister for small business&mdash;and I think in his heart of hearts the Deputy Prime Minister knows this&mdash;put his hand on the telephone, lifted it up and dialled Nick Greiner, he was in breach of ministerial standards and the ministerial codes laid down by his Prime Minister. The Deputy Prime Minister, the Acting Prime Minister, said that there was absolutely nothing different between the answer which the minister gave in this place last week on 19 June and the response from Mr Greiner. Acting Prime Minister: that is simply not true. The minister said in answer to a question that was put to him last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as the Coles Myer matter is concerned, I rang Mr Nick Greiner four or five months ago to ask for a contact name in Coles Myer for my brother.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Any mention there of Eaton? Answer&mdash;no. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Greiner suggested that my brother write to him. Other than this request for a contact point I did not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6124"> discuss any other matter with Mr Greiner and I have had no further contact with Mr Greiner from this point.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Any suggestion there that he spoke to Mr Greiner about Target?  Answer&mdash;no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet the Deputy Prime Minister is relying on a carefully drafted fax from Mr Greiner that arrived in this place at 3.47 p.m. yesterday, according to the time; of that fax he says, `I have absolute faith in its contents.' That fax from Mr Greiner said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have previously indicated, Mr Geoff Prosser rang me. We had a short conversation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That should be enough to hang this minister then and there. A minister of the Crown has rung the Deputy Chairman of Coles Myer about his business interests. Where in this fax in its entirety, does it mention Eaton, Acting Prime Minister? Where does it mention the issue of Target? Nowhere. Yet you stood up in this place this afternoon in your defence of this minister and said that his answer on 19 June was exactly the same as this fax which Mr Greiner sent yesterday. That is not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look further at the specifics yesterday of the defence that the member for Flinders, Minister for Industrial Relations and Leader of the House (Mr Reith) mounted on behalf of this minister. Talk about sucked right in by that and somebody thrusting it in your hand at the eleventh hour when you were in this place! He was asked about all these matters on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> this morning. The reporter, Fran Kelly, said, `So why the about&hyphen;face then? If he didn't mislead parliament yesterday, why did he decide to come in late last night and say, "Yes, okay, I did mention Target?"' That, of course, is the basis of our concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I just trace the history. Last week: question to Minister Prosser on Eaton, Target store and their relationship. Answer: no, didn't do it. Spoke to Mr Greiner but we did not talk about specific issues; no, didn't do it. There were three specific questions in this place yesterday. He refused to answer. Afterwards there was a censure motion in this place. He refused to answer, refused to confirm. He then scurried in here at 8.40 last night to lay down this statement that confirms everything that we have been asking about. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> And we are supposed to believe that this minister has nothing to hide!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To return to the Minister for Industrial Relations: in answer to that question, Mr Reith said, `Oh, well, there's a very simple answer to that,' that is, mention of Target. `I think that, in Geoff's mind, Bunbury&mdash;the Eaton lot&mdash;does obviously refer to Target.' He did not ring up Nick Greiner to ask him whether the price of fruit and vegies was going to be up or down next week. He did not do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He rang him up to ask him about planning issues and issues associated with the Eaton lot in Western Australia. If that is not the case, why did this minister come in last night and supposedly correct the record&mdash;supposedly, with his introduction, at the first opportunity? Minister, it was not the first opportunity. There were three questions yesterday and a censure motion and you did not do that. You scurried in when you thought all the journalists were gone and you thought you would lay that down. A bit later on, Mr Reith talks about the contact point again. In that radio interview this morning Mr Reith said, `All he was asked for was a contact point,' and the only sort of follow up to that was that Greiner said, `Get your brother to drop me a line.' And that was the end of it. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that was the end of it, I think you would be ever grateful&mdash;but that was not the end of it. What happened was that the issue of Eaton was raised by this minister with Nick Greiner and we have clearly demonstrated that that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole question about the Eaton lot was raised in this debate again today. As I recall, when we persevered with some questions to him in this place about whether he had any contact with anybody, the minister said, `No, no contact&mdash;formal, informal, no, not me. I haven't been caught. I haven't done anything like that.' I know the defence is going to come up here, and I can see the Treasurer (Mr Costello) smiling&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  on Thursday, 19 June, headed `Prosser denies he sought any favours'. I think that has been blown out of the water. The article, which is talking about Mr Prosser, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But he recalled former State planning minister Richard Lewis asking him at a social function whether he was involved with a company that had submitted a presentation to the State Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It seems everything on that side is social. There are never any formal contacts. They just seem to run into each other at social occasions and out of the blue they just talk about the minister's planning consent. This is the Retravision man! The man who owns the store runs the store. This is the man who, in Bunbury, is a legend in his own lunchtime. This is the man who has said, `I have no conflict of interest whatsoever.' And, yes, this is the man&mdash;I repeat&mdash;who told us today in this parliament, as a minister, that he did not have any contact, did not ask questions and did not talk to anybody. In a social sense, maybe that was right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I'll tell you what: you had better have a look at the answer that the Hon. Peter Foss gave in the Western Australian parliament recently to question No. 573 posed by the Hon. J.A. Cowdell to the Attorney&hyphen;General representing the minister for planning. There was a very interesting response to a series of questions. Remember: no hands on, no discussions; did nothing. Minister Foss said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A series of meetings were held and letters written between council, the proponents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Who are the proponents? Prosser Automotive Engineering. Who are Prosser Automotive Engineering? The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, his wife and his brother. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the Minister for Planning during March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In March 1996 there was a change of government and a new minister for small business. Who was it? Say no more. He is across here looking back at me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this minister might be back in the House later tonight with another clarification of what happened in terms of his social contact with people. This minister claims that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all he did was have social discourse with people&mdash;whether it is planning ministers or Nick Greiner&mdash;about Target and the Eaton site, but it is only ever in a social sense. His brother handles it; he does not know what is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister tries to tell this place that the Acting Prime Minister should not be censured for not sacking him, for misleading the parliament and for going absolutely and totally against the ministerial code, which, as I have demonstrated before in this place, is what has happened. Acting Prime Minister, that code is just not worth anything anymore. It is not even worth taking the bit that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ripped up the other day and putting it in a country outhouse.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not worth one little bit. We ask the Acting Prime Minister: have you satisfied yourself that this minister has told you the truth on every aspect on which we have been questioning you? You have said, `I have convinced myself because I have seen Nick Greiner's letter, and the minister has told me.' Have you phoned the Prime Minister, John Howard, in London and said, `This bloke is in more strife than Speed Gordon. I need to get a bit of guidance here. I am only the acting leader of Australia, but I don't know what to do about it'?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very good point. Perhaps you could borrow the phone that Mr Prosser, the minister for small business, used to get through to Mr Greiner. He had no trouble whatsoever. This minister has misled this place with his answer here on 19 June; by his statement last night, when he came into this place and confirmed Target and Eaton's site and confirmed discussions that have been ongoing; and through the evidence that has been suggested that, in social events&mdash;wrapped up in whatever it might mean&mdash;he has been dealing with planning ministers in respect of his own businesses and with issues 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6126"> that he, as a minister of the Crown, potentially has conflict of interest over and, perhaps even worse than that, which are of beneficial interest to his own companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For no other reason, this minister should be cut down. Acting Prime Minister, your weak defence in this place today of this minister is appalling. He should not place you in this position. Last night, after he had come in here and cleared this matter up, his final words should have been, `Because I have misled this parliament, because I have failed the Prime Minister's code of conduct, I am going to Yarralumla to resign.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister for small business owes us that now. He should resign now. He should talk to you, Acting Prime Minister, and that is the end of the matter. We think that this parliament deserves nothing less than that. You deserve censure for your weak leadership. It follows the weak leadership of the Prime Minister, who is over in the UK. Get on the phone to him this afternoon, tell him what has been going on, and get this minister out. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

What is more, you did not move a censure on a leader when you could not even make a case out against a minister. Once upon a time a censure was reserved for gravity in this place.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is interjecting on every point that is being made. This is the seriousness with which the opposition treats this censure: there is no leader and no deputy leader in the House. Who do we have? We have the spokesman for Aboriginal affairs on a motion which seeks to censure the Acting Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the essence of the charge? The essence of the charge is this: the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), somebody who has candidly put on the record his business interests, made a telephone call to Mr Nick Greiner and asked for a contact for his brother. Let us go to the conclusion: it amounts to a reason to censure the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). Let us strip it of all of the puffery, let us strip it of all of the false logic, and let us state the Australian Labor Party proposition: the minister for small business rang up Mr Nick Greiner and said, `Who does my brother talk to in Target?'&mdash;and that warrants a censure of the Acting Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To state the proposition is to be embarrassed by it. Where do the charges arise? The charges are said to arise in relation to the code of ministerial conduct. We have heard precious little about the code of ministerial conduct in the course of this debate, haven't we? We have heard precious little about how the charges are framed and how they are proved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The code of ministerial conduct says that you should not have a conflict or an apparent 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6127"> conflict of interest. What influence did this minister have over the decision of Coles Myer in relation to the Eaton lot? What influence did he have over the business planning of Coles Myer? If you had any doubt about it, what was the outcome? Where is the Target store on the Eaton lot? Let us look at the influence that the minister had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go out to Eaton. Where is the Target store at Eaton? There is silence from the other side. The proof is in the fact that he has not now, and never has had, any commercial relationship with Coles Myer. Have you proven it? Can you point to a site? Can you point to a contract? Can you point to a sale? He has not now, and never has had, any commercial arrangement with Coles Myer. Where is the apparent conflict of interest?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you get people who are trying to make political points without any factual basis whatsoever, they can throw these concepts around but they have got to be able to explain them. You have got to be able to say what influence he had, how that affected Coles Myer and how that conflict was used not for the public purpose but for his personal gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the personal gain? The first thing you should start off by saying is, `Here is the personal gain, here is how it arose and here is where the minister had a conflict between personal gain and his public office.' But there is no personal gain. You cannot start with the first factual proposition in relation to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what do you get? A bevy of allegations raised under parliamentary privilege&mdash;by people who do not know any better&mdash;on the theory that, if you can create enough smoke, people are going to say, `There must be something going on, because why would they waste parliament's time and why would they waste all that effort if there was nothing to it?' The truth is painful. They waste all that time because they want to take attention off themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party had a meeting today, after they had said that they would oppose work for the dole&mdash;it was on the record and taken to the people of Australia: `We, the Australian Labor Party are against work for the dole.' Last night, the leader of the Australian Labor Party withdrew all the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> objections to work for the dole, and they supported it. What did the backbench say to him at today's parliamentary meeting? They said, `Where were we on this? How come you got us out there opposing work for the dole when we ended up supporting it?' Do you know what I think the Leader of the Opposition said? He said, `Don't worry about that. We'll have a censure on Tim Fischer.' They said to him in the party meeting, `How come you took us out there on a limb? We were going to go to the barricades opposing work for the dole, and we ended up voting for it,' and he said, `Don't worry, we've got a censure for Tim Fischer.' This is working on the theory that, if you can take attention off that, you will at least neutralise the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The censure motion goes on to say that the Acting Prime Minister should be censured for failing to dismiss the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs because he used the status of his position to try to `secure a Target store as a key tenant for his Eaton shopping centre'. That is the allegation, but where is the evidence? There were two parties to the conversation. One was the minister himself who said, `I rang Nick Greiner in order to get a contact.' The other is Mr Nick Greiner who said, `He rang me in order to get a contact.' Where is the discussion about securing the Target store?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you who has been misleading the House here: the shadow minister for small business and consumer affairs. He started misleading the House yesterday. He asked this question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is the minister aware that Mr Greiner was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  on 20 June as saying that the minister had discussed getting a Target store into one of his shopping centres?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the allegation put to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Nobody had the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  in the chamber to check if the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  actually said&mdash;as was alleged by the shadow minister in his question&mdash;that the minister had discussed getting a Target store into one of his shopping centres. Is that what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  said on 20 June? That was the allegation you put to him. And now you condemn him for not answering it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6128">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> actually said, when we got it, was, `Mr Greiner, a non&hyphen;executive director, later said Mr Prosser had asked him if he knew of a contact at Target stores.' Exactly what the minister had said; exactly what Mr Greiner said in writing. You bowl up these false allegations in questions, and then you say, `He didn't answer them!' Have you ever heard of the question, `Have you stopped beating your wife yet'? One of you will get up tomorrow and say, `Have you stopped beating your wife yet?', and we will say, `We are not going to answer that', and you will say, `Oh, you're misleading the parliament!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You get up here and say that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> has alleged that Prosser has been on the phone trying to get a Target store into his shopping centre. He does not have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, he does not know what has been reported. When you go to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, it says that Mr Prosser had asked him if he knew of a contact at Target stores, a Coles Myer subsidiary. That is exactly what the minister himself said.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because you put a false allegation. Why would you answer? That disposes of that. We know who has been misleading the parliament&mdash;oh, yes, we know!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next allegation made refers to the Acting Prime Minister's `failure to dismiss, or seek the approval of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to dismiss, the minister as a result of the minister's admission that he is involved in the running of his businesses'. That is the charge, but where does the ministerial code of conduct talk about being involved in the running of the business? We pull it out. What does it actually say? It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers . . . must not engage in any professional practice or&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">listen&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the daily work of any business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, the charge is false. In the charge you misrepresent what the code of conduct says. The code of conduct is quite clear: not to be involved `in the daily work of any business'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do you think the words `daily work' are there? Obviously what it is saying is that you are not to be engaged on a daily basis in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> work. If someone happens to be a farmer and goes home to the farm, are you going to say they should be sacked if they open the paddock door? If they push the sheep into the shearing shed, are they out on their ear? `Whatever you do, Mr Farmer, do not walk onto the porch, because you will be involved in a business.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the same with somebody in small business. Are you going to say, `You cannot ring your manager'? It is the same thing. Are you going to say that they cannot make a phone call back or ask somebody, at the end of the month, what the figures were like? It would be very different if they were engaged in it on a daily basis, and the code of conduct is quite clear. You want to read out that phrase, `daily work.' <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have you got to show that he was engaged in daily work? The Labor Party's charge is that this is a minister who is engaged in daily work. Why? Because in four months he made a telephone call.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have got to tell you it gives you an insight as to what they think work is, doesn't it? They would think that this was an onerous small business opportunity. Where they come from, a union organiser who makes a phone call every four months is overworked. If you find a small business proprietor who makes a phone call over four or five months, he is engaged in daily work. Well, what a horrific thing that is. I have got to tell you that small business do not consider one phone call in four months an onerous engagement in a business activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perfectly plain from the code of conduct itself that the code of conduct envisages people staying as directors in private companies. It says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers are required to resign directorships in public companies. They may retain directorships in private companies&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and if retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the Minister's public duty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And then it gives an example:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Minister should question the retention of a directorship in a company in which shareholdings extend beyond the Minister's own family.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here the shareholdings do not extend beyond the minister's own family, so the example does not even require him to question it. You are supposed to question it if the shareholdings go beyond the private family. His do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can see what happened at the tactics meeting this morning. They walked in and they said, `How do we keep this going? We had a bad day yesterday.' The only person who has actually come in and given any disclosure at all is the minister himself, who, in order to make sure that everything was plain and on the record, came into the parliament last night. You have sat around and said, `We have got nowhere against the minister; let us try and get somewhere against the Acting Prime Minister.' And, when you get nowhere against the Acting Prime Minister, you say, `Have you seen the brother's letter? Have you spoken to Nick Greiner? Have you seen your wife this morning? Have you brushed your hair? Did you clean your teeth?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know what it is called? It is called a fishing expedition. You go fishing when you have nothing; and you have nothing. You have nothing against the minister, ipso facto you can have nothing against the Acting Prime Minister. There is no conflict of interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In November 1994, the Standing Committee on Procedure produced a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Application of modern technology to committee proceedings</EMPHASIS> . The committee recommended:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the House agree to a resolution authorising its committees to meet and take evidence by electronic means subject to conditions agreed to by the House from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Procedure Committee report also proposed certain conditions to govern the use of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6136"> electronic means of communications. The previous government had not responded to the report when the House was dissolved on 29 January 1996. Since the time of the report, technology has advanced even further bringing both greater clarity in transmission and lower costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 26 March 1997, following a request from me to the Leader of the House (Mr Reith), the House authorised the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training to take oral evidence from witnesses who were not physically present where the committee meeting was being held. That authorisation expires on 26 June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 29 May 1997, the Employment, Education and Training Committee conducted a public hearing using video conferencing facilities. A quorum of committee members was present in a committee room here in Parliament House. Over a period of two hours, 17 witnesses representing three organisations gave evidence from the Berwick campus of Monash University. That was the first time that video conferencing facilities had been used by a House committee, although Senate committees have made use of this technology a number of times. The hearing was a complete success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some differences between taking evidence from witnesses who are not physically present and the more conventional arrangements. The quality of sound and vision has to be of a good standard so that it does not impede or distract from the proceedings. Obviously, it is not possible for witnesses to pass documents across the table to members, although the technology does exist for electronic versions of documents to be shown simultaneously to both sides of a video conference and for those documents to be transmitted and printed. It is even more important than usual for witnesses to identify themselves clearly before speaking, particularly if they are appearing as a group, so that Hansard is able to attribute correctly the comments of speakers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no reason why a committee could not effectively manage these differences, and the benefits from using video conference facilities can be substantial in terms of sav 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ings in time and money. There is considerable convenience in being able to hold hearings in sitting weeks with witnesses who are interstate. A quorum of the committee could easily be arranged in Canberra for the 29 May hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for a trip to Melbourne by committee members who live elsewhere, secretariat staff and Hansard officers was able to be avoided. The time savings alone from avoiding travel were considerable. The Sound and Vision Office has indicated that the charge for the link between Canberra and Melbourne is approximately $30 per hour. No charge was made to the committee for the use of the Parliament House facilities. The commercial cost of hiring the Monash University facilities is $150 per hour, although they were kind enough not to charge the committee for this inaugural video conference hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the cost of the two&hyphen;hour hearing held by the Employment, Education and Training Committee was only $60, but it could have been as much as $360. The total cost of an eight&hyphen;hour link between Melbourne and Parliament House, Canberra, would be $1,440. By comparison, the cost for two secretariat staff to travel to a full day hearing in Melbourne would be approximately $1,345, consisting of taxi fares, $145; airfares for secretariat staff, $820; and, travel allowance for secretariat staff, $380.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To that would have to be added the cost of hiring a venue if one could not be found without charge and the loss of productive hours spent by the staff while travelling. Of course, Hansard would incur similar costs for its staff travelling to Melbourne for a hearing which, although they do not come out of committee expenses, are still additional costs to public revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A hearing in Melbourne also would involve some members travelling from their electorates to Melbourne and the costs resulting from that should also be taken into account. There is no doubt that a day's hearing in Melbourne would be considerably more expensive than hearing from the same witnesses via video conference. For a hearing of fewer than eight hours, the use of video conference facilities 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6137"> linking Canberra and witnesses in another city becomes even more competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, there are advantages in a public hearing where the committee and the witnesses are in the same place. Interaction between witnesses and committee members is easier where eye contact is possible and body language clues can be read. Members also have the chance to talk with witnesses before and after the formal hearing. Therefore, the committee does not recommend that video conferences be considered as a substitute for the more conventional hearings but rather as a useful adjunct when the circumstances warrant it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee recommends that the standing orders be amended as quickly as possible to allow as a matter of course the holding of hearings using video conference facilities. The use of this technology will maximise the capacity of committees to take evidence efficiently and effectively and result in significant cost savings.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6137"><TITLE>Public Works Committee</TITLE><DEBATE.SUB2 PAGE="6137"><TITLE>Reports</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the sixth and seventh reports of the committee for 1997 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Decontamination for disposal of the former Albion Explosives Factory site, Deer Park, Victoria</EMPHASIS>  and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Airport: International terminal&mdash;Olympic upgrading</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the reports be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By leave&mdash;The first report which I have tabled concerns the proposed decontamination for disposal of the former Albion Explosives Factory site, Deer Park, Melbourne. This project was referred to the committee in March 1994, but the committee was unable to report on it for reasons which I will explain later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The project examined by the committee involves a proposed agreement between the Department of Defence and the Victorian Urban Land Authority for the decontamination of the site of the former Albion Explosives Factory at Deer Park. This is part of a series of steps which would also allow the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Urban Land Authority to develop the 460&hyphen;hectare site for housing, industrial, retail and community services and setting land aside for nature conservation purposes, for open space and for habitat protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Urban Land Authority will be responsible for the management of decontamination of the site and its development for sale. The return to the Commonwealth would be a series of payments from the Urban Land Authority based on the value of the land assessed in an uncontaminated state. Under these arrangements, the net cost to Defence for the remaining remediation works was estimated to be $3.84 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has recommended that Defence enter into the proposed arrangements with the Urban Land Authority. The proposal put to the present committee is vastly different from the earlier proposal. That proposal, referred to the committee in 1994, was for the decontamination of the site, with no development. The cost of the earlier proposal&mdash;and I ask the House to note this&mdash;was $57 million. This was in addition to about $15 million or $20 million which had been spent on cleaning up 60 per cent of the site before the matter was referred to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was due to the diligence and persistence of the previous chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), that these savings to the Commonwealth are now possible. Therefore, the present proposal, estimated to cost $3.84 million, is a marked improvement on the earlier proposal and demonstrates the effectiveness and importance of the Joint Committee on Public Works as a watchdog on public expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are well aware, there is no shortage of people prepared to criticise parliamentarians on both sides of this House and the role of committee work. The proposal that I currently put to the House actually illustrates the value of this committee. It is tangible evidence of the money that the committee has been able to save the parliament and the people of Australia because it was alert to the unintended but effective wastage that was occurring. Mr Hollis can be proud of the fact that he was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6138"> the one who deferred the original project, and a much better project has resulted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main findings of the committee's report are that there is a need to decontaminate and remediate the remaining 40 per cent of the Albion Explosives Factory site, and there is a need for total site disposal. Furthermore, any costs to the Commonwealth of decontamination and remediation should be offset against the potential value of the property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also concluded that the involvement of the Urban Land Authority as the manager of the clean&hyphen;up and development of the site can be justified on the basis of expertise and proven track record. It was suggested that the developer of the site should have been tested on the open market. The committee considers, however, that the decision by Defence to enter into a single source arrangement with the Urban Land Authority, without testing the market, was based on independent advice to Defence from a number of sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contaminated soil stored on the site or still in situ will be relocated to specially engineered repositories. Based on expert advice, of the remediation options considered, the on&hyphen;site repositories are feasible technically, offer the greatest flexibility and have cost advantages. Whilst the Commonwealth will retain the long&hyphen;term risk arising from site decontamination, expert advice to the committee indicated that there will not be any health problems caused by the use of on&hyphen;site repositories. The question of responsibility for monitoring the repositories remains unresolved. The committee has therefore recommended that this responsibility be assigned to relevant state authorities at the time of the finalisation of the formal agreement for the remediation, disposal and development of the site by Defence and the Urban Land Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A preliminary land use plan for the entire site has been developed. This plan will need to be further refined into a local structure plan under the Brimbank planning scheme. Under the proposal, the state of Victoria will assume ownership of a large amount of parkland to be managed by the Victoria University of Technology. For this reason, the committee has recommended that, in land transfer negotia 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tions between the Commonwealth and the state of Victoria, the significant improvement to public amenity arising from the transfer should be recognised. The committee has also recommended that any additional costs associated with infrastructure improvements on land designated for public use should not be the responsibility of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A large proportion of an area designated as parkland is the habitat of the endangered legless lizard. The committee was assured that relevant Commonwealth environment protection agencies are satisfied that the process involved in the progressive sale will adequately provide for Commonwealth commitments relating to the protection of endangered species on the site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that this reference has caused some hilarity around the chamber. I point out to those who are in the chamber that it is something of an irony for the Public Works Committee, because there was an occasion when the Public Works Committee was involved in the location of a building in Canberra&mdash;Mr Hollis will know which building&mdash;when it was discovered that the site proposed for the building was on the only other area in the nation with a sizeable legless lizard population. Effectively, in three years, the Public Works Committee has found itself involved in proposals that have affected the habitat of this endangered species, the legless lizard, with both of these proposals being centred in areas with a high population of this particular little beast. If the legless lizard ceases to be an endangered species, it will have the Public Works Committee of the federal parliament to thank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very little of the old explosives factory buildings remain. The committee has recommended that, apart from tree lines and the black powder mill, all existing structures on the site be demolished, as they represent a potential health and safety hazard. A management regime will need to be developed for the black powder mill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second report which I have tabled involves the proposed Sydney airport international terminal olympic upgrading proposal. As will be obvious to all members of the chamber, it is a major exercise of particular 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6139"> significance to everyone in the nation in anticipation of the Sydney 2000 Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal examined by the committee involves the provision of additional terminal facilities required to meet the expected demand by 2003. In summary, these facilities are as follows: ten additional aircraft parking positions; extensions to the aircraft taxiway system; new air&hyphen;side departure lounges and associated retail facilities at piers B and C; additional check&hyphen;in and baggage claim facilities; and associated building works and related engineering and building services improvements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An elemental cost plan prepared for the project provides for a design and construction cost at completion of approximately $350 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's inquiry extended over two days, taking evidence from a variety of organisations and individuals and noting carefully comments made by local government and community groups. Witnesses were asked a series of standard questions to elicit their response to the fundamental issue under consideration, namely, the future of Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Faced with the increased demand on the international terminal, that a decision on the second airport has not been made and that construction of any new facilities must be completed by the end of 1999, what choice does the committee have other than to recommend that the work proceed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The so&hyphen;called `do nothing' option is not feasible. To do nothing would result in a decline in the level of service to passengers and compromise the efficient operation of the terminal. In terms of aircraft, the option would result in aircraft possibly waiting for one or 1&half; hours on taxiways before accessing aircraft parking positions. Inside the customs hall, passengers could be left waiting for up to two hours for their baggage. Clearly, this is unacceptable at any time and it is particularly unacceptable in preparation for the 2000 Olympics. The House should note that, even if a second airport were to be constructed starting tomorrow, the completion of that airport would take at least five years. In that time frame, the demand for these facilities at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Sydney airport would have already been exceeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against this background, the report concludes: first, that Sydney airport, as the main gateway to Australia, has an essential role in meeting increasing passenger demand into the next century. Secondly, as no decision on the location of a second Sydney airport has yet been made, Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport remains the only international airport in New South Wales. Thirdly, if the improvements required to cater for increased traffic are not made, the ability of the airport to cope with demand will be seriously impeded. Fourthly, the timing of the Olympics and the associated pressures on facilities mean that any improvements will need to commence immediately in order to avoid construction during the Olympic period. Finally, forecasts provided by the Federal Airports Corporation indicate that 10 additional gate positions and associated facilities are required, which would satisfy requirements until 2003.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee concluded that the success of the project is dependent on continuing and adequate consultations between the Federal Airports Corporation and all affected users. In this context, particular attention should be given to the needs of people with disabilities during the detailed design phases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report notes that a large proportion of the cost of the proposed investment will be offset by increased revenue expected from retail operations. The committee was assured by the Federal Airports Corporation of the commercial viability of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one matter about which the report is critical of the Federal Airports Corporation. The proposal had not received the required clearances by the relevant Commonwealth environment protection authorities before it was referred to the committee. Many of the issues raised by local government authorities and community groups regarding the impact of further development and the Federal Airports Corporation's responses to them should have been the subject of environmental impact assessment and subsequent clearance by protection authorities before the public hearing. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6140">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Federal Airports Corporation was in the process of preparing a notice of intent, which it intended lodging with Environment Australia sometime after the hearing. The committee believes the Federal Airports Corporation proceeded on the erroneous assumption that the timing of the environmental clearances could await the committee's consideration of the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was stated by the FAC that issues raised during the committee's inquiry would be taken into account in the preparation of the impact assessment. The committee does not see itself as a substitute for an appropriate environmental assessment of any proposal. This responsibility rests with proponents complying in a timely manner with the provisions of the act before proposals are referred to the committee. The committee has therefore recommended that any further development of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport should have appropriate environmental clearance before being referred to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am happy to commend both reports to the House. I am happy to have been associated with the Kingsford Smith inquiry because of its significance and its importance in the preparation for the Sydney Olympics. I am pleased that the committee has been able, without delay, to facilitate the process of this report, and the fact that that facilitation has occurred without delay is a credit not only to the members of my committee but to the members of the Public Works Committee secretariat, who have worked tirelessly to have these reports tabled ahead of schedule so that both projects could proceed without delay.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am only going to talk about the decontamination for disposal of the former Albion Explosives Factory site and I want to associate myself with comments made by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew)&mdash;not so much the generous comments he made toward me, because I was only one member of that committee and he was a member of the committee which recommended the stay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when members of parliament come under close scrutiny and criticism for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expenditure, it is not every day that a committee can come before this House and say that a decision of that committee saved the Australian taxpayer, at a minimum, $30 million. That is what happened during this project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the project was first put to the committee back in 1994, we were under a considerable amount of pressure to go ahead and have the clean&hyphen;up. Over a period of 18 months or two years, the proposed cost of the clean&hyphen;up went from less than $1 million to $12 million&mdash;when we put a stop to it&mdash;and finally it was being proposed at $57 million. But this $57 million was only for starters. What they were asking for was an open&hyphen;ended cheque; that $57 million was a minimum. It would have created a whole new work opportunity for environmental lawyers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were worried not only about the amount of taxpayers' money that was being spent but the precedent that was being set. Once we went ahead and set this precedent, that would have been the guideline for every environmental and clean&hyphen;up project&mdash;and there are quite a lot of them coming up over the next couple of years. There would have been an open cheque and there would have been no guarantee that the Commonwealth would not have been subject to legal action later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee, of which I was the chair at that time, put a stop to it. We asked for various studies to be carried out. The committee came under a tremendous amount of pressure. We had various telephone calls, meetings with officials and so forth. It was hinted that we did not quite know what we were doing and we were a little out of our depth. Perhaps on some technical aspects we might have been, but we did know that $57 million for starters was an incredible amount of money. We were given no guarantee that it would have stopped at $57 million; it could have gone on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased that very early in the life of the new committee, under the chairmanship of the member for Wakefield, this was referred back and a much better, vastly different project has come up. I know that the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) will speak later on a different aspect of it. Nevertheless, I think it was important that that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6141"> amount of money&mdash;$30 million&mdash;was saved. Make no mistake, that $57 million would have been spent and no-one would have blinked an eye. It would have just been spent and that would have been it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am quite proud of my association with the Public Works Committee. We act as a watchdog. It is perhaps one of the unsung committees of the parliament. People do not go on it to make a great political career&mdash;look at me! Nevertheless, it carries out a role that I believe the parliament is here for&mdash;as a watchdog over public expenditure. I do not want to detain the House or bore the House, but there are a whole range of projects on which money has been saved&mdash;$10 million here, $8 million there or $7 million. But in this case the $30 million saved was because of the work of the Public Works Committee, not only the previous committee but the current one. I am sure that that committee will continue with its very important role of watchdog for this parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you kindly. We obviously have a mood of self-congratulation in the chamber, so I am happy to be the beneficiary of some of that. I am also chairman, as were my predecessors in the electorate, of a consultative group that has considered the options in the future for this area over a lengthy period. The one option which has been absolutely unacceptable to the local community has been a `do nothing' option. It is pleasing that the Public Works Committee's report clearly represents a significant step towards the resolution of the difficult issue of the use of this 460&hyphen;hectare site.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an area that for some time has been largely derelict. It is a most unsightly area of land from the point of view of the local community. Because of its scale and size, it has represented a very significant physical barrier to easy movement through the western suburbs of Melbourne. Partly as a consequence of the land's location, it has contributed significantly to those traffic problems and made the resolution of them somewhat 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more difficult. It has also represented a huge opportunity cost in terms of housing and other uses for such a large parcel of land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The release of the land progressively, apart from the benefits of housing&mdash;we are potentially looking at a whole new suburb there&mdash;also provides a significant additional resource to the Victorian University of Technology. It provides, as other speakers have said, recreational and environmental opportunities, as well as a number of very interesting job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deal that the Commonwealth is getting out of this, as the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) have indicated, looks pretty good. It is certainly a lot better than it could have been. The Commonwealth has to understand that it is the Commonwealth's activities, in pursuance of its defence activities, that have caused the problem on the land. Therefore, it would be unreasonable for the Commonwealth to escape from its obligations to the local community associated with the contamination of the land. We all obviously have an interest in minimising that cost, and this arrangement seems to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Urban Land Authority also gets a fairly good deal. It has a particularly good record as a land developer in Victoria. I think it remains the largest land developer. It has a very positive effect on the real estate market in Victoria in terms of its equity, so it is a very welcome participant here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that what is fundamentally important to the local community is that the Urban Land Authority, despite its good record, does not seek to get off the hook regarding the important commitments it will need to fulfil to the local community, particularly in off-site works&mdash;that is, as a consequence of building a whole new suburb in this part of Melbourne, there are going to be very significant demands on infrastructure in the area, particularly transport and traffic infrastructure. There will have to be significant improvements to the road network and the capacity of the road network in the area to sustain the large population increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Urban Land Authority has verbally given plenty of assurances to the community 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6142"> committee I chair that it understands its commitments in that respect. I put it on notice now that it will not be getting off the hook in terms of my actions on the matter and other people's actions on the matter if it does not in a real way understand that there are going to be significant off-site works as well as on-site infrastructure works required here, particularly in the Furlong Road area. I put that on notice in the chamber at this stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does not oppose the proposition just moved by the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) because its effect will be to restore the ships bounty to where it should have been before the government axed it in the budget before last. This is a government with no industry policy, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and its having no industry policy is the reason why unemployment continues to climb and why the manufacturing industry has no confidence in this government and has been calling for an industry plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that what the government has ended up with so far by way of an industry policy has had nothing to do with them; it has all been of Labor's making. I mention the circumstance the other day of the car plan&mdash;Labor's car plan essentially embraced by this government. Having labelled it three hours before in the parliament as cheapjack populism, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was humiliated into going into a press conference that night to accept the thrust of Labor's car plan. We still want to see the detail of the replacement for the export facilitation scheme, and we are still of the view that the review of the industry should be brought forward to 2003.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from those two items, the rest of what the government has embraced Labor campaigned on from the end of last year onwards. The government resisted it, was forced to accept it and now has a car plan. A week before, it was saying that we did not need a car plan, it did not have a car plan and, when it finally announced its car plan, it embraced Labor's car plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is similarly the case with the bounties. The government abolished four bounties in the budget before last&mdash;those which covered the book publishing industry, the shipbuilding industry, machine tools and robots, and the computer industry. The government has now agreed to restore two of those four bounties&mdash;those relating to ships, and machine tools and robots. The book publishing bounty has been extended by six months, but the government has still fallen six months short of what Labor had in place, and the computer bounty is still being opposed by this government. I will come to those aspects at a later stage in consideration of the message from the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the purposes of this part of the debate, I want to concentrate on just the shipbuilding bounty, in relation to which the government did another massive backflip. They told the shipbuilding industry in August last year that they were going to abolish, without any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6145"> consultation, the shipbuilding bounty. This is a bounty set at five per cent. This is a bounty which has assisted the shipbuilding industry become a world&hyphen;class manufacturer of wave&hyphen;piercing catamarans, fast ferry services, for the rest of the world. As a result of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spirit of Tasmania</EMPHASIS> being refitted, it will now become a fast ferry operator on Bass Strait on a trial basis over the next couple of weeks with a capacity to travel 200 knots in just under five hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is world&hyphen;class technology, and those on this side of the House have had the pleasure of travelling on one of these ships to see what it involved. The same invitation was extended to the government and not taken up by one member of that government. They make these decisions without understanding the impact. They make these decisions without understanding the ability of this industry to come from nothing and be a world&hyphen;class competitor effectively exporting all of what it produces but having to compete with a distorted world trading environment because countries with whom they have to compete offer significant incentives. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> These countries, Italy in particular, offer significant incentives to their industry to build these competing vessels. Italy offers a bounty in the order of 20 to 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The catamaran producers of Australia were saying, `We can compete with a bounty at five per cent versus 25 per cent but we cannot compete at zero. What we expect is a bit of support from the government to recognise that it is on the margin that it is going to be putting us out of business. We need to retain this bounty.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was Labor that ran the campaign to retain the bounty. It was run by the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) and the member for Franklin (Mr Quick). It was also run by our Western Australian members of parliament, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) and the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) as well as Senator Cook. We have visited the producers of these vessels all around the country. We understand what they have come from to be, and we insisted that the bounty be retained. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally the government buckled under pressure and agreed to the retention of that bounty. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is currently in Santiago, issued a press release on 7 May, outlining an agreement that he said was the government's position, extending the shipbuilding bounty to 30 June and essentially meeting almost all of Labor's demands, except for the point that we will not wipe out the bounty in 1999, which has been extended to 30 June 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that we will not wipe it out then if the other countries with whom we are competing have not signed up to the OECD shipbuilding agreement. There is no guarantee that they will, and we have argued that. Nevertheless, the industry have said, `Don't push for the extra point on the OECD agreement. We're happy as it stands now, if we get a timely enough review before 30 June 1999 in which our position can be reassessed'&mdash;in essence, to take account of whether the OECD shipbuilding agreement is acceded to by the other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me put on the record that Labor will be going into the next election saying that it will not be reducing the bounty if those other countries have not signed up to the shipbuilding agreement. That is not the government's position; it is Labor's position. We will be arguing that at the appropriate time. We said to the shipbuilding industry that we were not prepared to hold up the agreement that they had reached with the government, through our pressure, for that point alone. That is further down the track; we can deal with it at a later time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, having got the agreement, this government threatened over the weekend&mdash;threats by Minister Moore's office as well as by Senator Abetz in Tasmania&mdash;that, because Labor had won in the Senate on computers and on getting an extension in relation to books, that meant the end to the shipbuilding agreement. Such a condition was never put by the government when it said to the industry, `We will reach an agreement with you.' But it was what Senator Abetz was campaigning on in Tasmania over the weekend, and I had many calls from the media about it. The government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6146"> was introducing a new factor&mdash;not the shipbuilding industry standing alone, but a conditional agreement with the shipbuilding industry: `If you sink the computer industry, if you sink the book publishing industry, we'll keep shipbuilding afloat.' We reject that nexus. Our response at the time was, `Go ahead and reject the shipbuilding bounty, and we'll be down in Tasmania campaigning on this issue again,' the government has backed off from that nonsense. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude this aspect on this final intervention, because it is important to understand that this is a government that has no strategic approach to any aspect of industry policy. It responds only to pressure. It is a government that, in all of its positions, will crumble to pressure. It crumbled in the case of cars. It crumbled in the case of ships. We got a semi-crumble in the circumstance of the book publishing industry. But, then, because we won the other two bounties, the government sought to use that fact as a threat to the shipbuilding industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think the shipbuilding industry deserves better treatment than that. We were immediately to their defence&mdash;not just I, as the shadow minister, but all of our members in Tasmania and our members in Western Australia. Those states are the two big centres that are the beneficiaries of this bounty. We need to understand the position in Tasmania, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins. It has an economy with horrendous unemployment. The shipbuilding industry is the largest private employer in that state. It employs almost a thousand people, and this government's budget decision of last year would have put them out of business. If you do not believe that, Minister, go down there and talk to the shipbuilding industry. Do what your senior minister was not prepared to do at the time: go and talk to the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only time Minister Moore, Black Jack, has visited the shipbuilding site in Tasmania&mdash;maybe there was a new game opening at the casino, I do not know&mdash;was when he was forced into accepting Labor's position and did a double backflip to restore the shipbuilding bounty. They have done backflips on the issues of ships and machine tools and robots. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They have also got to do a backflip on the issue of computers and they have got to do it fully in relation to the book publishing industry, because that is the other message that has come back from the Senate. They are the amendments the government will not accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to those industries, `Remember the history of the shipbuilding industry. Remember that the government abolished the shipbuilding bounty in August of last year, but it's now restored. It's restored because an effective campaign was run to have it restored, and Labor was at the forefront of running that campaign. We concentrated on the regional dimensions. We concentrated on the jobs at threat. But we also concentrated on the fact that, if the bounty were to be retained, we would not only protect the existing jobs but also get more jobs and more exports.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought, Minister, that the two most pressing economic problems facing this country were jobs and the balance of payments; yet the decision that you took to abolish the shipbuilding bounty put both of those into the negative. You would have seen job losses and no more exports. Labor's plan is to keep the bounty in place until the other countries reduce theirs and to use the fact that we are keeping something there as a form of pressure on those other countries to reduce theirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would they be pressured if we had nothing to bargain with? What we were saying is: keep the bounty and we will get more jobs and more exports. Labor had a plan for jobs. Labor had a plan for exports. This was a government too stupid to see it, until the final pressure succeeded in the campaign with the amendment that we have here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My message is: congratulations to the government for accepting Labor's plan on the shipbuilding industry. But to the book publishing industry and to the computer industry, the message very clearly is: develop your campaign to properly have your bounty restored too. The Senate is on&hyphen;side with you. We have the numbers in the Senate; the government has not. The Senate is prepared to back sensible industry policy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6147">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor will be at the forefront in trying to have those retained. Whilst it is true that we are accepting this amendment to retain the shipbuilding bounty today, it is only happening because Labor led the charge. I suggest to the minister at the table he should also accede to keeping the computer and book publishing bounties. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to touch on the amendments dealing with the ships bounty. I am very pleased that this has now passed, and of course we are giving it our support. The ships bounty is very important to the Incat operation in Tasmania. There are over 1,060 employees in this operation and it generates enormous economic activity for southern Tasmania. I think there are about 170 apprentices and 82 trainees presently in traineeships at that plant and those people are gaining very valuable skills and adding to the economics of that part of the state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that the management of this company has said that if they could not keep that five per cent bounty, they would certainly be laying off employees. They said that they could not compete against other manufacturers of similar ships in other parts of the world. All they wanted was to be treated basically in the same way that other governments were treating their shipbuilders, especially throughout Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course that comes back to this government's failure in its industry policy area. It really does not have an industry policy. It failed to understand that industry policy has a connection to jobs and economic activity and that you must place industry policy very large in your thinking if you are going to affect unemployment levels and continue to generate new jobs and new activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased&mdash;I think my colleague the shadow minister mentioned it&mdash;that the Incat being built in Tasmanian waters is going to replace the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spirit of Tasmania</EMPHASIS> when she goes in for refitting in a few weeks time. She will cross Bass Strait for two weeks, replacing the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spirit of Tasmania</EMPHASIS>. We are all hopeful that that will be a very successful two weeks and that, in the future, we will have an Incat 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coming across&mdash;if not one, possibly two. Those Incats are capable of crossing that strait in 4&half; hours, possibly 5&half; hours, as opposed to 15 or 16 hours, and that means a lot of opportunities from a Tasmanian perspective. Where the boats should go is a matter of some debate in Tasmania. The general consensus of course is that the faster we breach the strait, the better opportunities we have of getting produce and passengers to and fro.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It all comes back to that industry of shipbuilding in Tasmania, which has been very successful. There have been some other spin-offs from it. There are now other smaller companies that feed into the Incat operation and generate more activity that way. I say to the government that the industry policy position is of the utmost importance when you are looking at stretching out jobs and keeping jobs in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very disappointed with Senator Abetz, the Liberal senator from Tasmania, over the weekend. The position being run in Tasmania is that because the Senate had held up the other three amendments to this bill, dealing with the robotics, machine tool making and books bounties, that therefore was going to mean a loss of the ships bounty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This process has been like drawing teeth. I fully agree with the remarks by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) that the outcome that has been thus achieved is much better than that which would have occurred but for the pressure that has been sustained on this government for months and months on behalf of the shipbuilding industry in Tasmania and in other states. Yet it is still not adequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Plainly, this should be linked to an undertaking that the bounty not be abandoned, save 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6148"> if there are similar decreases in bounty protection in other comparable trading countries. Yet the improvement is very substantial. And it is due entirely to the work that the member for Hotham undertook: his visits to the shipbuilding sites in Tasmania and the pressure that he mounted in conjunction with the industry upon this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was extraordinarily disappointed that at the last minute this government sought to use this particular decision as a pressure point on the opposition in relation to other bounty schemes. That was a disgraceful performance. Thousands of workers involved in this industry, and the investors and all those associated with it, were suddenly placed in a position where those who had created the environment for the change of policy that this government was forced into were being told that the amendments that have been put forward ultimately by the government were going to be withdrawn unless there was a change of heart by the opposition in relation to associated bounties&mdash;books, computers and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a terrible last&hyphen;minute betrayal of those very people who had been the subject of the change of policy. No wonder that decision lasted for 48 hours. On the weekend, Senator Abetz issued a press release in Tasmania, the thrust of which was that, unless there was a backdown by Labor in relation to the other bounties, the government would withdraw the commitments it had made with respect to the shipbuilding industry. No wonder that perished in such a short period of time, because the unbelievable betrayal of all those people associated with that industry, the uncertainty and the lack of confidence in the industry that would have immediately been manifest plainly showed how stupid and destructive that threat was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come now to the situation where we do, as a labour movement, correctly pause to reflect on what has been a hard 15 months work in finally changing this hard&hyphen;hearted government's mind about an industry that is so crucial to the state of Tasmania's economic future. It is one of the few rays of bright light in a state which is suffering massively from the withdrawal of funding that this federal government has subjected it to, where a state 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Liberal administration has no answers in terms of policy development and where essentially all around there is a sense of malaise, stagnation and gloom. In that environment, to find this government so reluctant in the first place to bring forward policies that could sustain a growth industry in a state facing extreme competition from overseas in the first instance and then, once they were persuaded to that course, to then turn on the people to whom they said they were giving their support and threaten to withdraw that support for simply political ends was a betrayal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we can reflect that we stood firm right through this process. We are encouraged that, by standing firm on these principles, the workers, the investors and those associated with the shipbuilding industry in the state of Tasmania and shipbuilders in production right around this country will have a greater chance to maintain their ventures into the future. This has been a great credit to the member for Hotham. He has changed an outcome. To do that from opposition is a difficult task.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6149"> this parliament as to why a recommendation from the Senate should not be accepted here. Let us have a look at what this amendment says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before any change in the rate of a bounty referred to in this Act comes into effect, the Minister must cause to be laid before both Houses of the Parliament a report containing a cost&hyphen;benefit analysis of the relevant bounty scheme, including an assessment of the impact on employment, exports, investment, growth and international competitiveness of the cessation of the bounty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What is wrong with that, Minister? Do we hear an explanation in this place? You are part of a government which said that you wanted this parliament to be more accountable, that the parliament was to be given greater primacy, that the parliament should be given the opportunity to debate and analyse. Don't you remember those high&hyphen;sounding words by the Prime Minister? Yet here you have a proposal before this House that does just that and not only do you knock it over but you do not even give us an explanation as to why you oppose it. The fact of the matter is that you do not have a justification for knocking it over. At least be honest. Just tell us you are following instructions. I would like to know whether you share the view because industries want to know the basis upon which you make decisions which affect them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the ludicrous position where the only source of advice to government in relation to industries being restructured now comes from the Productivity Commission. I think they still have to get the bill through which finally sets it up&mdash;although it may already have gone through. There used to be the Economic Planning Advisory Council, the Bureau of Industry Economics and a whole range of sources of advice coming to government so that cabinet could sit around the table and consider differing points of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that prides itself on being pro&hyphen;competition, but it does not want competition for ideas around its cabinet table. It wants the Productivity Commission, under the Treasurer (Mr Costello), to be the only source of advice to them. We know how disastrous that approach is. The Productivity Commission's approach, as you know, is going to be consistent with the Treasury 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> line&mdash;that is, any expenditure to anyone, in this case business, regardless of what it does, is no good because it detracts from the budget bottom line. `We will cut it'&mdash;that is their recommendation&mdash;`regardless of the consequences.' That is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, had you had before you, as a cabinet, the sort of advice that this amendment seeks, maybe you would not have taken the stupid decisions that you did. When you have advice coming only from a driven Treasurer&mdash;driven to get the budget bottom line down at any cost regardless of the consequences&mdash;how can proper regard be given to the fate of industries and their future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment should be supported because it makes the government more accountable. It requires them to put in the public domain the impact of decisions like cutting the bounties. I would suggest to the minister that he at least use the opportunity to get up and tell us in this place why the government is opposing this amendment. We deserve much better from you than this, Minister. We know you have hidden on other things, but for God's sake don't hide on this one.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That Senate amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 be disagreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government does not accept the Senate amendments, which would remove the provision in the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill for early termination of the book bounty on 30 June 1997. Early termination of the book bounty on 20 August 1996 was announced by the government in the 1996-97 budget as part of its strategy for fiscal consolidation. Termination was extended by the government, in December 1996, to 30 June 1997 in recognition of contracts already in place at the time of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The book printing and publishing sectors have derived significant benefits from the bounty in the past, within an environment of declining rates of assistance. For example, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6150"> bounty has declined from 20 per cent in 1987 to 4.5 per cent on 1 January 1997. Over this period, bountiable production increased. The industry will continue to benefit from the existing copyright arrangements, which provide Australian copyright holders with a strong incentive to print in Australia. It is the government's belief that this bounty should not be extended past the currently announced termination date of 30 June 1997. Accordingly, the government opposes these amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition believes that amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 should definitely be agreed to. I indicated a bit earlier that this government abolished four bounties. Through pressure from the Labor Party, we have succeeded in getting two restored and the books bounty, which we are now discussing, being partially restored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In August of last year the government announced that it would knock off the books bounty in June of this year. Again under pressure from Labor we got an extension of that decision by six months. We have just heard the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) say that that was done in recognition of contracts already in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real problem is that the book and book publishing industry expected this bounty to continue until the end of 1997. It was told as much during the election campaign when this government was out there campaigning. It had contracts entered on the basis of that full extension. So, if the argument is right that the government has extended it by six months, why not extend it to 12 months, in accordance with the Senate proposition and with your promise in the last election campaign, which interestingly enough happened to be the recommendation from the Industry Commission for the book publishing industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government which commissions reports from the Productivity Commission and the Industry Commission, and ignores them. We know it ignored the recommendations in the case of the car industry. It had to roll over and accept Labor's plan, against the Productivity Commission's recommendations. Here 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you had a specific recommendation from the Industry Commission not to cut anything, but to keep it until the end of 1997&mdash;and you ignored it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not pleading for a special handout for this industry. We are just telling the government that it needs to have regard to what its competitors do. For example, New Zealand has a 50 per cent subsidy on production costs of certain books. New Zealand is the sort of economic model that it suits the government to hold up from time to time. It is supporting its book publishing industry. Singapore is another country that we often have quoted to us. It is one of the Asian tigers. It has tax breaks and incentives specifically to support its book publishing industry. So ours is an industry that is not playing on a level field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that it is important to enable this industry to continue to compete until those countries reduce their levels of protection. Again, we are talking about a minimal level of support versus huge levels of support. This is an industry which, in Australia, can continue to operate, function and compete with the level of assistance provided by the book bounty but not with it being cut from underneath it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, it is important to understand the impact of this industry on the nation. It is estimated that 2,600 jobs will be lost in the printing and publishing industry if the book publishing bounty goes. We have already seen some of those jobs lost in Adelaide, where, with the announcement in last year's budget that the bounty was gone, Griffin Press laid off 140 workers. What they are looking for is the restoration of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area which is terribly important&mdash;and I know the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) will want to speak about this&mdash;is the impact in regional areas. Maryborough in Victoria employs 2,600 people. One quarter of them work in the book publishing industry. Of the work force of Maryborough, 25 per cent is in jeopardy because of this government's decision. We know that, because we visit these areas. We talk to the workers and the managers of these places. We get to understand what is important to them. But

What industry in Australia needs&mdash;particularly those firms located in regional areas&mdash;is certainty in their investment environment. In the lead&hyphen;up to the last election, the book publishing industry thought they had that in the promises that were made to it by the current government. The simple fact of the matter is that they were lied to by the government. A very explicit promise was made to this industry that this bounty would be retained but, no sooner had the government come to power than&mdash;in its first budget&mdash;it sought to emasculate the provisions that had been put in place for this industry by the previous Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the honourable Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser)&mdash;who is sitting in here tonight defending the government's position&mdash;that people in regional areas will not forget what you have done in this bounty legislation. Nor will they forget the broken promises that have been the overlay to the measures that you are seeking to overturn tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has already stated that this industry is a significant one. It received support from Labor when we were in power. Under the support regime that existed for this industry, book exports grew by some 200 per cent over a 12&hyphen;year period. The industry restructured to become more competitive, and it managed to secure the employment of its existing work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other countries have bounties and other assistance in place to support their book 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> publishers. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the government is proceeding down the path of seeking to withdraw these assistance measures: it was on the back of these assistance measures that quite explicit investment decisions were made by firms in this industry. As the honourable member for Hotham has indicated, at the end of the bounty period&mdash;at the end of this year, according to the original plan&mdash;we would have required the Productivity Commission to examine the progress of our trading partners in reducing assistance measures to their book publishing industries, and we would have instructed the Productivity Commission to investigate the impact any changes might have in regions and on jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said that it has proceeded down this path because of the budget position and the state of the economy. This must be the only government in the western world that can look on massive job creation and a four per cent growth rate over four years as an economy in a state of decline. Nevertheless, if economic imbeciles want to hold to that belief, there is nothing that I am going to say that is going to stop them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Hotham has mentioned the importance of these jobs to regional Victoria. He mentioned the town of Maryborough in Victoria&mdash;which both of us have visited. There, of the work force of some 2,600 people, about 600 are engaged in this industry. I wonder where the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) and the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid)&mdash;both of whom would have an interest in employment in these areas&mdash;have been in defending this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 18 September, 1996, I asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) in this House:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is this: this is an industry that has grown from a very small base. It grew from a small base because Labor had in place plans to get it into export markets. We made our support for the bounties conditional upon them increasing jobs and increasing exports.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The measures that are contained in this particular 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> series of amendments to this bill are designed to restore what rightfully belongs to this industry according to the plan that the previous Labor government introduced for this industry and which was agreed to and promised by the current government in the context of the election campaign in March 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has already alluded to the fact that these particular firms in this industry are located primarily in regional areas. He mentioned the town of Maryborough in Victoria, which both of us, as I mentioned in my previous remarks, visited in the wake of the first Howard budget when these particular bounty measures were to be withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that the executives and the workers in these particular firms spoke in quite disparaging terms about this current government. Even then, they referred to the fact that it was a rudderless government in terms of industry policy. Even then, they said they had a weak industry minister. But they were hoping that some commonsense would prevail and that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would intervene and perhaps carry the day on their behalf with some logic and with some support for the promise he had made to the Maryborough community. And they were hoping they would receive some support from the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), who know this area intimately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But, sadly, they were betrayed by the member for Ballarat and the member for Bendigo. Sadly, they were betrayed by a hapless and hopeless industry minister. Sadly, they were betrayed by a Prime Minister who cutely divides his promises into core promises and non&hyphen;core promises. And today, in this House, they have been betrayed by a minister who should not be occupying the position that he does in this place at this point of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, when we look at the triumvirate of the Prime Minister, the industry minister and the minister for small business, we see that the people of Maryborough have been badly betrayed. They will not forget, as I said in my previous remarks. The honourable member for Hotham, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) and I have all been there to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6154"> deliver support to the workers and to the management of the firms in these particular areas. They will not forget this act of betrayal in the first Howard budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The words of encouragement that have been given to the people in these areas by the member for Hotham, I can only reiterate and support. This is a weak government led by a weak Prime Minister. We know from past experience that, when the heat is turned on them, they roll over like little puppy dogs, have their tummies tickled and eventually come to the party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we are attempting to do in supporting these amendments is to ask the government to keep faith&mdash;to keep faith with the promises they made to the people of Maryborough and the people of Adelaide, and to keep faith with the workers who have done so much to restructure their industry and to position their industry for future job growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want the government to keep faith with the promises they have made to the people across the length and breadth of regional Victoria. The people of Maryborough have suffered badly at the hands of a Liberal state government. There is no discretionary income because of the gambling situation in Victoria. Wages are very low because of the flexible wages and conditions that have been introduced by this state Liberal government and now this federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people were asking for some certainty and job security. They have not got it from this government. They have not got it from the Prime Minister, the industry minister and the hapless small business minister, who hangs around now swinging in the breeze waiting for his comrades to cut him down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small Business Minister, you should have gone long before this particular piece of legislation entered the House. You will be gone very soon. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Now it has hit the fence and we the poor old hapless junior minister, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser)&mdash;and junior minister not much longer; he should be preparing his further defence&mdash;in here today having to defend a position where the Senate have sided with Labor to force this government to honour its election promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You went to the last election promising to match Labor's retention of the bounty to the end of 2000. Labor had put in place a very successful strategy, part of which the minister has alluded to in terms of his glowing report on the success of this industry, but it only happened because there was an industry policy in place. The computer bounty was part of it. The partnerships for development program was another part of it. The commitment to research and development was another part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were many different elements, but all of them were geared to the fact that, if companies were to get the assistance, they had to commit to growth in investment, in jobs, in research and development and in exports. That is what sensible industry policy is about, but this government does not have a clue. It dismantles the very essence of a successful program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last 10 years&mdash;see if this sinks in, Minister&mdash;under Labor's strategy for the IT industry&mdash;computers, software, telecommunications&mdash;exports of computer hardware have increased nine times, a pretty significant achievement, I would have thought.

You dismantle the very basis for which you do it and you do it on the basis of the Treasurer (Mr Costello), Mr Smug, sitting back up there, no doubt getting more congratulations about his performance today, being driven by the budget bottom line. Regardless of the consequences, you have cut these programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Total industry exports, including hardware componentry and printed circuit boards, trebled over the last five years. That was under Labor's plan. So these things are not subsidies to the industry; they are investments in the future of this nation. They are leveraging commitments to jobs, to exports, to research and development and to significant investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The combined effect of the scrapping of the bounty and the DIFF scheme, and the budget cuts to research and development, AusIndustry and the export market development grants scheme, is that all these things have been set back. For the first time in 11 years, exports of manufactured goods&mdash;elaborately transformed manufactures&mdash;are zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, we were achieving growth of 17&half; per cent per annum in exports; and you have grounded to zero in 12 months. Great achievement&mdash;well done, Minister! This is a terrific incentive for them. And what do you do? You stand up there as the so&hyphen;called minister for small business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other industries which these bounties concern, and with which we have dealt this evening, are the IT and communications industries. We have seen the government admit the error of its ways in relation to the shipbuilding industry, a vital industry for Australia and particularly for some of our regional parts such as Tasmania and the east coast&mdash;shipbuilding is a very significant part of their work force. But the reality is that the IT and communications industries are an even more substantial part of Australian industry. Shipbuilding is important, books are important and the robot and machine tool bounties all have a significant role to play. Yet IT and communications is a multibillion dollar industry for Australia and, unfortunately, it is a multibillion dollar industry where we are losing the race in terms of our regional commitments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has a $7 billion trade deficit in IT and communications areas. Unfortunately, we import some $10 billion worth of IT and communications products every year. We export some $3 billion, leaving a $7 billion trade deficit in IT and communications. It is important that Australia does import substantial components of IT and communications because they are vital to productivity in the economy. They add enormously to the productivity of the manufacturing and services sectors and, of course, that will happen more so into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that 10 years ago we had a significant position in this industry. Labor built it up steadily through the bounties, through coordinated industry policy, through a whole range of activities, as the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has said, to a point where we were mounting substantial exports and where we did have a significant base on which to build. What has this govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6157"> ment done? It has attacked every component of the IT industry that it can find. It has broken an election promise; it has removed the bounty; this evening it is opposing again the Senate's attempts to restore that bounty and to force this government to maintain and honour its election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from that, this government seeks to attack the IT industry in the outsourcing areas. Outsourcing by the federal government will have a very significant and negative impact on the IT industry in this country. How will small and medium&hyphen;sized enterprises in the IT industry maintain their contribution when overseas multinational companies take over the government's IT outsourcing and all of the componentry&mdash;all of the small manufacturing sector in this country that want to contribute through government purchasing to Australia's export in IT and communication services? How will those companies cope when multinationals are sourcing their componentry from overseas, where they, not the domestic industry, will dictate the standards and the level of commitment which those companies have?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government purchasing component of IT is very substantial. By outsourcing that, you will destroy the very basis of the industry in this country. You have attacked it through the bounty, you are attacking it through outsourcing, and you have failed to illustrate the way in which you will gain any substantial savings from that IT outsourcing. The reality, if we look at the Intergraph example in Victoria, is a complete disaster, costing the government money and not saving it. If you look at the EDS example in South Australia, you can see that outsourcing to multinationals does not produce savings. Those savings are completely illusory and you lose all control over the industry. You lose all control over the supply of components; you lose all control over government purchasing and you will have no control over the privacy aspects of this important industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government data is substantial. Government has a vast investment in personal data held on behalf of citizens in this country, and there is no way that the government will be able to maintain that once it has outsourced it. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reality is that the Bevis report of the industry, science and technology committee of this parliament, which was tabled a few years ago, illustrated the importance of government purchasing policy, particularly in maintaining IT and communications. The reality of this decision is that not only is the government attacking IT through removing the bounty, but it is also attacking IT through outsourcing and failing to maintain a coordinated industry policy which will allow government to make some real impact on the IT trade deficit. That is where this minister and this government have failed us; that is where the government's policy will not take us down any productive path. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

The information technology industry is very significant around Queanbeyan. They are very interested in understanding what their representative in this place is doing to support their future. We also want to know where the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) is because there is a significant industry up there. I see the member for Indi looking through the door, skulking out there.

We forced you out in the rally in Albury in defence of the car plan. We got the car plan up for you; we are happy to help you get the computer industry plan up now. But what we want you to do is to show the good people of Indi where you stand. Cross the floor! Come and join us! We developed the car plan that you have now embraced. Now we are trying to get you to embrace the information technology strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that at least the member for Indi is in the chamber, but what we want him doing is voting for the computer industry, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6158"> not against it. If you support the government's position on this, you are voting against the computer industry. You are voting against the workers of IBM. You are voting against the community of Wangaratta. And if you don't believe that, get up and speak in this debate and tell us how you are defending them. I challenge you to do that, because this person sitting at the table will not get up and give any explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a further dimension to this, because we know that the government has before it what is called the Goldsworthy report: a report into the information technology industry which recommends to government that they should develop an industry plan for the information technology industry&mdash;computers, software and telecommunications. But where is that report? It is hidden. They have had it since before the budget and they still have not released it; just like the TCF plan, which they are holding back until next Monday&mdash;surprise, surprise, the first working day after parliament rises. Originally it was to come down on Friday, until they realised parliament was sitting on Friday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that tells us it wants more accountability, it wants to be more open, and yet it hides the report. There is a pattern to all of this. They released the first report on the automotive industry just before Christmas. They did not release the second report until they made their decision, and then after the parliament got up. They will not release the first TCF report until after the parliament gets up this time. And they are still sitting on the Goldsworthy report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What shonks you are! Why don't you go into your party room and insist these reports be produced? Taxpayers' money has been put into these. The information technology report was written by a former president of the Liberal Party, but I suspect his report embarrasses your government because it actually calls for an industry plan. That is why it will not be released. What we are doing here today is not just calling for the retention of this bounty. We are not just calling on the regions that have workers in this industry&mdash;and I see the member for Indi moving around to the exit door; now we have embarrassed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> him back into his seat. We are wanting those workers, like the textile and automotive workers, to get up and insist that their member stands up for their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Abolishing this bounty puts their jobs at risk. Go and speak to IBM about it. You have got a responsibility to stick up for the workers of Wangaratta, stick up for the industry and, more importantly, insist upon the release of the Goldsworthy report so we can have a debate about where the information technology industry should be going in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no leadership from this government. What we are saying is, support the amendments which have come from the Senate because we will be sending them back to you from the Senate again. This is an industry that deserves support.

It is the only one of these bounties which it has failed to move on so far. It was the one which was the subject of the most specific commitment of the election, yet it is the one on which you are reneging most seriously.

We saw his government's debt blow out to totally unacceptable levels, and it has to be paid off by people who do not even have the vote yet. His policy was to keep pouring the money out without ever giving the industries concerned any incentive to stand on their own two feet after a reasonable period of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that he wants the world to believe that the tariff decision of this government was all his work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No; you cannot turn back what has happened. But the reality is that this was the great push. I remember it. Who talked about the 40,000 albatrosses around your neck when, to win an election, you destroyed the Australian manufacturing sector in the metal trades? We do not forget. We know what you did&mdash;and all for your own personal aggrandisement. It does not work. The reality is that this is good policy, and you know where the solution to manufacturing costs lies. It lies in turning around&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I talk to industry all the time and I will tell you one thing they all want: of course they all want handouts. Everybody wants a handout.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were to stand with us and show a bit of statesmanship and help out in relation to the tax system, you as a party could help out in the national interest. You can point to the deficiencies you believe exist, and you can come up with solutions, if you have any brains at all. You know that the Australian tax

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports the Carriage of Goods by Sea Amendment Bill, which amends the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, which relates to the giving of effect to the Hague Rules. The act currently has an automatic trigger in it which would take effect on 20 October 1997. But the government, the industry and all affected parties believe that it is a good idea to remove this automatic trigger and to provide for a regular review before the Hamburg Rules are adopted. The legislation also clarifies the situation with respect to the availability of legal rights within the Australian legal system not being impinged upon by the fact that arbitration in the United Kingdom is provided for in the existing legislation and broadens the regulation making power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is essentially a compromise between shippers, shipowners, insurers and other interests in the industry and it reflects the report of the maritime cargo liability working group. The Hamburg Rules are better for cargo owners than the existing Hague Rules, but only 22 countries have adopted them, most of them in Africa, covering only approximately one per cent of international trade. The bill also facilitates technological improvements, such as the adoption of new 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6164"> technology&mdash;for example, electronic data interchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition supports the bill. We have substantial problems with the broader government policy with respect to the maritime industry, particularly the government's proposals to introduce foreign guest workers into our domestic transport system in the form of coastal trade, to expand the risk of ships of shame causing environmental problems with respect to our coast, to reduce seafarers' wages and conditions and to deny fiscal support to Australian shipping to place it on a competitive level playing field with international shipping.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Carriage of Goods by Sea Amendment Bill 1997 amends the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991. When the original act was debated in 1991, there was objection to the previous government's inclusion in the act of the Hamburg Rules provisions without any set period for their proclamation. As a compromise, an automatic trigger mechanism was included in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act; thereby, if the government did not adopt the Hamburg Rules within three years from the making of the act, these provisions would come into effect unless parliament determined otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter was deferred in 1994 for three years. Had nothing been done in October of this year, the automatic trigger would have come into operation. A cargo liability working group was set up in 1995 to examine the issues involved in this debate and make recommendations to improve the cargo liability regime for Australian shippers. The group included representatives of shippers, carriers, shipowners, marine insurers and marine lawyers&mdash;all relevant groups in the industry. In October 1995, the report of the marine cargo liability working group was presented to representatives of concerned industry groups and a package of measures was endorsed. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is acute difficulty at times in the carriage of goods and people by land, sea or air in terms of legal interpretation and analysis. Whenever anything that remotely resembled a problem that arose in relation to carriage of goods by land or by sea, or where air carriers' liability was concerned, a whole host of rather complex legal situations came into play and limitation periods abounded. A lawyer acting in the matter had to be extremely careful to ensure not only that his own professional indemnity insurance was up to date, for fear of an error that could be made with the very strict limitation periods and unusual traps for young players that were in those pieces of legislation, but also that the right steps were taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, this legislation, in my view, attempts not only to rectify some inequities in the system but also to unravel some of the oddities involved. Shipper's liability and liability at sea have bedevilled jurisprudence for many years. If you care to peruse the Lloyds law reports, you will see numerous cases involving interpretation of liability conventions, rules and common law developments that arose from interpretations of various pieces of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was an absolute legal minefield. Basically, it is largely due to the peculiar risks, I suppose, and the mode of transport that was used as it evolved from very primitive sailing vessels, vessels that were not particularly seaworthy, to the much more modern fleets that are around. As we saw from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, there are still some very unfortunate vessels at sea. That is basically where it came from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unusual development of rules, and certainly the particular dangers that are at sea, have never been conducive to plain sailing. For example, many people would think that the real dangers are there the further you go out to sea&mdash;sailing around Cape Horn and so forth. When I was at sea, I can recall that the worst weather I ever encountered was off Jervis Bay. I have sailed across the Pacific several times, across the Tasman, across the Great Australian Bight in the Roaring Forties, off the coast of the States and up in the Far East, but the worst weather ever was off 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6165"> Jervis Bay. That is why, when you are looking at the sorts of rules that have evolved in this area, it is no good saying, `The insurance premiums jump up slightly the further you go out or the closer you are to Cape Horn.' A different set of regimes and intricacies are involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for the exporters. In my own electorate, I have some exporters who avail themselves of shipping lines to export their goods. A company in Brendale exporting a substance called bentonite uses containers for that purpose. It is important for them in particular that the shippers, the owners of the goods, have a bit of security for their goods. Over the years that has been a fairly negligible thing. Liability has been avoided through some rather unusual provisions in the insurance contracts and in the conventions and rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to bear all those things in mind and to ensure that the peace of mind of those people who are shipping goods is enhanced, so that our competitive edge can be improved in what is a highly competitive international market. If we can assist and facilitate the movement of goods and give some comfort to the shippers of these goods, we are assisting in earning much needed export earnings. These particular measures go at least a fair way to doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of vessels starting and finishing in various localities, basically it stands to reason that ships can be in a tropical area when they set out and end up somewhere off Newfoundland at the end of their voyage. There are a lot of peculiarities involved and damage to marine cargoes can result from all these things. The problems that have arisen because of all these things have basically, you could say, piled up like deck chairs over many years. Carriers, insurers, lawyers and politicians have tried valiantly to reach some accord on the laws relating to the carriage of goods by sea but, like so many ships sitting at the bottom of the ocean, the chance of universal agreement has frequently sunk without trace up until recent times. The fact that the world still grapples with this problem can at least give us some comfort as we proceed along this road, a road that I think is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a good one, with the full agreement of the industry behind the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current act did seek to charter a safe course through the maze of marine cargo liability and, in effect, adopted the Hague Rules as basically a safe bet. They have been around since 1924 and were remodelled in 1968, 1969 and then in 1979, and these became the amended Hague Rules. Notwithstanding the longstanding acceptance of the Hague Rules, a new sail, if you like, was sighted on the horizon in the Hamburg Rules and was thought to be a thing of the future, shifting more of the responsibility to the carrier. They were included in the 1991 act and, as I said, were to come into effect in 1994. Due to a relatively slow international response, landlocked countries accepted them but most of the major shipping countries did not and deferred them, as did the parliament here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the Hamburg Rules trigger this year basically pressed the industry and in effect all relevant groups in consultation to come up with some acceptable compromise because to be automatically adopted in October 1997 would be an obvious commercial disaster. What has occurred in reality has been a very good compromise and is one that is supported by the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Briefly put, the Hamburg Rules trigger is deferred for 10 years. Bearing in mind the time that has elapsed leading up to this position, it is a relatively short time, one would think. The ongoing reviews of the system are provided for with full consultation with all parties. A wide&hyphen;ranging power by regulation to engross the solutions as they develop is included. This relates to points such as documentation and deck cargo and will be covered by the liability regime provided that, no later than at the time of booking, specific stowage requirements of the shipper have been notified to and agreed by the carrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the duration of liability, the carrier liability is extended to the period where the cargo is in the carrier's care within the limits of the wharf or terminal at port of loading and discharge. There is coverage of importers and carriers may be made liable for loss due to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6166"> delay to the Hamburg Rules limit of 2.5 times the freight payable on the goods delayed, except where the delay is an excusable delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nautical fault&mdash;I will not go into that in any length&mdash;is another area that has been looked at. In the past it has been an escape route for many international shipowners or carriers. We have an arbitration situation now as well. There should be explicit provision for arbitration in the act. A reference to arbitration in Australia should not constitute an ouster of jurisdiction offending section 11 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, it is a solution that has come about effectively by a good deal of negotiation and a great deal of compromise, I suppose, on the part of some people. On the other hand, the relevant groups, particularly the insurers and the lawyers in the industry, have come up with something that hopefully will promote people like my constituents who are looking to secure safe passage for their goods overseas and to have those goods delivered promptly, efficiently and in an undamaged condition and, if they are not, that they will be paid if the loss has come about as a result of what has occurred between when the goods were left on the wharf and when they arrived on the wharf for their point of destination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my submission, these measures are good and are the sorts of measures which will promote those seeking to export goods while, at the same time, providing a little more certainty and equity in an industry where there has been a good deal of uncertainty brought about by legal interpretation, prolonged litigation and frequently injustice at the end of the day where shippers of goods have sustained substantial loss as a result of negligence and/or other actions of the carrier. In all, I support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They never pay. This Carriage of Goods by Sea Amendment Bill is a package of conditions that have been agreed to by the cargo liability working group, who have noted that the Hamburg Rules do favour the export of it. All things considered, including the interests of all parties, this is about the best deal that they could come to, leaving provision to go back in the future and look more at the Hamburg Rules.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rules still do not cover electronic data interchange or electronic commerce. That is something to which a lot more effort has to be directed if we are going to get the efficiencies that can arise from that. So the legislation covers only paper based transactions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hamburg Rules, as was mentioned earlier, shift the onus of liability from the cargo owner to the ship operator or owner. Australia's ability to utilise the benefits of the Hamburg Rules depends very much on what our major trading partners do in respect of the Hamburg Rules. We can go it alone. As the previous speaker, the member for Dickson, has said, it is mainly the landlocked countries that have embraced or ratified the rules of that convention, but our major trading partners have not. We can come back to that later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we are an integral part of international trading arrangements, it is important that we are in step with our major trading partners. I need to mention that the transport of purely domestic freight is not covered by this legislation or by the legislation in its ultimately amended form. That is consistent with the existing liability that applies to domestic land transport, that is, road and rail. Such freight is normally covered by consignment notes. However, where a domestic leg is part of an international trade, then it would be covered by the provisions of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The failure of Australian industries to develop an interest in developing an Australian flag fleet&mdash;owned, chartered or even controlled&mdash;is a clear indication of the immaturity of Australia's export and import industries. Australia's failure to value add in the transport and insurance services to our exports and imports is a major reason for the massive deficit we incur in invisibles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only encouraging light on the horizon in recent years&mdash;it is not a sail on the horizon, but a light on the horizon&mdash;has been the decision of CRA to expand their sales of iron ore on a CIF basis. The fact that their action will result in better business for CRA's products and a contribution to an improvement in our invisibles deficit is in no way due to the actions of this government. CRA made a commercial decision to utilise their know&hyphen;how of the shipping industry to offer customers a mine to mill supply of their products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their know&hyphen;how of ship and service quality and their ability to offer reliability of delivery are good selling points for their products, to which they can add certainty, convenience of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6168"> service and one price from point to point. It is called value adding in services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shipping freight payable on our exports in 1987-88 was $4.4 billion. Shipping freight payable on imports in 1987&hyphen;88 was $2.1 billion. Unfortunately, no information is available for later years. If I want to get that information, I, as a member, have to buy it from ABS. I am not prepared to do that. I think it is a reflection on the parliamentary services, on the arrangements in this place and upon the government that, if I want to get that information, I have to buy it. It ought to be available to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the net deficit on invisibles in 1990&hyphen;91 was $2,605 million. This arose from invisible credits for shipping freight in 1990&hyphen;91 of $3,164 million and invisible credits for shipping freight of $559 million. By 1995-96, the net deficit for invisibles had risen to $3,284 million. This resulted from invisible debits for shipping freights of $4,505 million and invisible credits for shipping freights of $1,221 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, looking at the background to this legislation and the background to the industry and the international trade movements from Australia, the bill provides the framework for coverage of liabilities incurred in the carriage of goods by sea in the course of our international trade. Hence, it is of great importance to Australia's shipping industry, all of its maritime related services, as well as Australia's international trade which provides the cargoes for carriage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Maritime Network&mdash;which I chair&mdash;is a voluntary organisation. It includes all people and organisations that are directly or indirectly involved in the movement of seaborne cargo and people. It is a voluntary association of people and organisations committed to growing Australia's maritime services. Movement of freight by sea generates greater expenditure and activity ashore than at sea. When one takes into account all the shore related professional services, such as ship design services and all the other matters in which employment and expenditure are incurred, the greater share of expenditure and activity is onshore. In other words, the blue water sector is the minor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> financial component of the overall service and complex of activities. Maritime alert nations know this, and that is why Norway, Greece, Cyprus, the EEC, the Scandinavian countries, the People's Republic of China and, more recently, Germany campaign hard to expand their national flag fleets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, in covering liability for carriage of goods by sea, goes to the heart of Australia's maritime network. Australian marine insurers, who are world competitive in rates for iron ore to Japan, are locked out of that market by agreements between Japanese iron ore purchasers to insure only with Japanese insurance companies. These companies do not compete with each other and are not world competitive. Yet this government and the galahs in Japanese cages in this country mouth the platitudes about efficiency and competitiveness that emanate from those opposite and from Japanese steel mills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just possible that the current US action in Japan may be able to break up the Japanese insurance cartels. Maybe the APEC discussions that are going on&mdash;to my knowledge from this government in good faith&mdash;can also impact in some way on the breaking up of these kinds of non&hyphen;tariff impediments to greater trade and Australian services. We should be doing everything possible to create opportunities for Australia's marine insurers and maritime service providers. These include bankers, financiers, ship repairers, ship chandlers, ship designers, maritime educators and trainers, maritime consultants and researchers and crewing agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The list goes on and includes lawyers, who I will come to. A measure to remove an unspoken non&hyphen;tariff barrier to the use of Australian arbitrators and lawyers in dispute resolution is included in this bill. In the package of proposals agreed by the cargo liability working group is a requirement that there should be explicit provision for arbitration in the act. It states that a reference to arbitration in Australia should not constitute an ouster of jurisdiction offending section 11 of the act. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson) said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6169">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry has concerns that, under existing legislation, arbitration has not been available as an option for resolving disputes.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tucked away in charter parties&mdash;the contracts for the hire of ships&mdash;there is often a clause that refers any dispute to arbitration in London.

That innocuous little clause, tucked away in the charter party&mdash;often unread&mdash;has served to protect the London legal profession from competition from maritime lawyers from the Antipodes. There was a time&mdash;not far distant&mdash;when London legal costs, expressed in &pound; sterling would simply have the &pound; sterling sign changed to $A when the service was provided by Australian lawyers, so great was the difference between the charge made by Australian lawyers and that made by London lawyers. So effectively &pound;1 sterling equalled $A1 for the same service, if it was our service here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The London arbitration clause hindered the development of an Australian based arbitration forum and Australian lawyers with specialised local knowledge of the region. It has been a chicken and egg situation. Experience is essential, but there must be opportunity to gain that experience. This legislation will ensure that the barriers to gaining that experience are removed. There are qualified Australian maritime arbitrators available. The Maritime Law Association of Australia and New Zealand has a panel of arbitrators on stand&hyphen;by to participate in dispute resolution and to arbitrate where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The entrenched inertia that advantages foreign shipping related interests to the detriment of Australia's maritime network has been evident in government purchasing in this nation for years, despite previous attempts to at least give Australian firms an opportunity 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to quote on insurance and related services&mdash;freight and all the other services involved. I am pleased to tell the House that Australian firms should have greater access to Commonwealth government business, because Commonwealth government procurement guidelines have been amended to create greater awareness of local suppliers of freight and insurance services.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Insurance and freight can be significant and often hidden components of the costs embedded in the purchase price of imported goods. Procurement officers have a responsibility to consider these costs where they are significant and look for opportunities to reduce them in seeking value for money.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context, `insurance' should be read as `marine and war risk insurance', that is, `insurance to cover loss of, or damage to, goods while in transit'. `Freight' means `shipping (by air or sea) the item to Australia'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not the same as `delivery', which is shipment from the seller's warehouse to the delivery point nominated in the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local insurers, insurance brokers, carriers, freight forwarders and the like should have the opportunity to compete for these aspects of Commonwealth business. Procurement officers should also consider the practical and commercial advantages of dealing with ANZ suppliers of freight and insurance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The new guidelines should provide greater opportunity for Australian Maritime Network firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation covers the liabilities of those involved in the complex&mdash;even arcane&mdash;arrangements of activities and services that constitute the movement of international trade by sea. It is a murky world in which we delve when we turn to the maritime industry. But, at federal level, this government is pursuing a policy designed to wipe out the carriage of freight between Australian ports by Australian flag ships. As a preliminary, we are seeing an acceleration of the use of foreign flag ships between Australian ports in certain circumstances under single voyage permits. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6170">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This action is aimed at taking the jobs of members of the Maritime Union of Australia, thus weakening the union and, the government hopes, crippling it. However, as I said last week in the AN debate, the single voyage permits they have aimed at the MUA are striking the rail industry in Australia. Let me quote some figures to support this. In 1995&hyphen;96 foreign flagged ships operating under SVPs carried 3,236,701 tonnes of cargo between Australian ports. Included in those figures were 13,829 containers, 20&hyphen;foot equivalent units, which were moved between Australian ports by foreign flagged ships under SVPs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to emphasise that specifically 5,400 twenty&hyphen;foot equivalent units, TEUs&mdash;which means a container&mdash;or 95,226 tonnes, were transported from the ports of Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide to Fremantle or vice versa as cross&hyphen;Australia traffic. In the six months from 1 July 1996 to 31 December 1996, 3,715 TEUs, or 67,727 tonnes, were carried by foreign flagged ships between Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide to or from Fremantle. In TEU terms, the first half of 1996&hyphen;97 is equivalent to 69 per cent of all TEUs carried on those courses in 1995&hyphen;96, and in tonnage terms it is 71 per cent. Clearly, the government's shipping actions are undermining national across&hyphen;Australia rail traffic and rail employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the state scene, most relevant to this legislation is the attempt by the Queensland state government to levy an 8&half; per cent stamp duty on all marine insurance contracts on ships while in Queensland ports. How are you able to specify how long a ship is in a Queensland port and for what period of a total journey, if you have an annual premium or a premium on cargo or hull and machinery covering a voyage? How are you going to segment out the bit that covers coming into territorial waters, into the port for 24 hours and out again and then levy 8 per cent on that share of the premium? I do not know how it might work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, worse than that, this action by the Queensland Office of State Revenue flies in the face of all action taken by other states to improve port efficiencies and reduce port charges. On the one hand, from the outfield, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comes the Queensland Office of State Revenue: `Eight and a half per cent, thank you very much, domestic and foreign ships.' And on the other, we are exhorting the port authorities to improve performance and reduce charges on shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Add to that the fact that we all know that it is well nigh impossible to track down the owners of foreign ships operating into ports here. Generally, they are at least two stages removed. You have to track down who is the beneficial owner of the ship, and that is extremely difficult. If the Queensland Office of State Revenue think that they will somehow be able to do what everybody else cannot, that they are the Dick Traceys and they will be able to track them down and get the money&mdash;good luck to them. I do not think there is any prospect of their doing that, but in the meantime those charges would be levied on Australian flagged ships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So here we have another barrier or another level of disadvantage being applied to Australian ships because of a state revenue&hyphen;chasing charge and not being applied to foreign registered ships. I have a letter here from the Queensland Treasurer to the Australian Shipowners Association which says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have expressed some concern that Australian shipowners may receive unequal treatment in regard to their stamp duty liability compared with their foreign counterparts. Let me assure you that this will not be the case and every avenue will be pursued to ensure that foreign owners meet their Queensland stamp duty obligations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is from Joan Sheldon, Deputy Premier, Treasurer and Minister for the Arts, back in May. Good luck to her, but I think she is way out of touch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation is important. It has the support of both sides of the House and it covers a complex area. There are more things that we could add to the discussion that need to be said, but time does not permit that. But the last thing I want to highlight is that I appeal to the minister, when he looks at these speeches, to raise this matter with the Council of Australian Governments. This is an outstanding case of state policies conflicting with federal policies and conflict within states between other state agencies. The levying of state stamp duty on cargo and marine hull 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6171"> insurance on ships operating into our ports is an extremely important issue. Whatever a charge is going to be, it ought to be uniform across Australia and that applies equally to foreign registered ships and to Australian registered ships. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always an education in shipping to listen to the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) on any bill that is relevant to this area of transport policy in Australia. I am sure that the port authorities in the other states around Australia will be trying to take the best commercial advantage because of the actions of the Queensland government that the member for Shortland just alluded to. But in the national interest, I suppose, he raises a good point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of the lack of competition or otherwise in the transport of containers from the west coast of Australia to the east coast, it will be interesting to see what happens with the possible sale of AN. Having a private operator operating viably and efficiently could provide some stiffer competition for either Australian flagged ships or internationally flagged ships that are carrying those containers from east to west or west to east. I would suggest that maybe the reason the shipping industry benefited from that cargo may have been because of the less than efficient operations of AN in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Carriage of Goods by Sea Amendment Bill gives effect in Australia to an international convention&mdash;the amended Hague Rules&mdash;relating to carrier liability for loss or damage to marine cargoes. The amending bill is supported by industry. It is supported by shippers, shipowners, the marine insurance sector and maritime law groups. The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) has left the chamber, but I understand that he has a particular interest in that discipline. The member for Shortland alluded to some of the inequities that exist in the industry as far as arbitration is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry agreed compromise, which is the basis of these amendments, is based on the view that it is not appropriate that Australia adopt the Hamburg Rules at this time, but that various amendments should be made to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enhance the extent of the protection afforded to Australian shippers of marine cargoes. The shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), and the member for Dickson highlighted that the signatories to the Hamburg Rules are predominantly landlocked countries. It is another one of those areas where Australia is involved in international conventions, and we need to take a more flexible and pragmatic approach to this, as we do in a number of other international public policy areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package is endorsed by industry. The Cargo Liability Working Group considered at length the elements of difference on which a compromise is achievable and offered proposals for consideration by the industry. A meeting of industry interests endorsed the following proposals as the basis for recommendations to the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. That the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Carriage of Goods by Sea Act</EMPHASIS>  1991 . . . be amended in the following respects:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We come to the point of non-negotiable documents, which the member for Shortland did highlight. The recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All relevant shipping documents should be covered, including electronic documents.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coverage by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Carriage of Goods by Sea Act</EMPHASIS>  of non&hyphen;negotiable documents in the coastal trades will be further considered.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There should be explicit provision for arbitration in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that was the other area that was alluded to by the previous speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Right across the industry there is support for the bill that is currently being debated in the House. The bill has the support of shippers, shipowners, the marine insurance sector and maritime law groups.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6172">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will extend the protection now offered by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act to Australian shippers. It will increase the incentive for carriers to minimise loss or damage to marine cargoes&mdash;therefore, improving efficiency of their part of the operation. It will put downward pressure on marine cargoes insurance costs. In other words, Australian cargoes carried by sea will be better protected. The actual carriage will be more efficient, and the insurance sector predominantly will be more efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Protection will be extended to areas including: coverage of all relevant contracts of carriage, not just bills of lading; coverage to cargoes carried on deck; carrier liability will be extended to the period where the cargo is in the carrier's care within the limits of the wharf or the terminal; and carriers will be made liable for loss due to delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amending bill also removes the Hamburg Rules trigger from the legislation. Only about one per cent of Australia's international trade is with parties to the Hamburg Rules convention. Industry is concerned that the adoption of the Hamburg Rules would increase total transport costs, through incompatibility with Hague Rules regimes, uncertainty and increased litigation. The industry agreed compromise is based on the view that it is not appropriate that Australia adopt the Hamburg Rules at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to note in my research that even the ALP was of the same view back in 1991. The then minister for transport and present member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) made the following comment in his COGSA second reading speech on 15 October 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government will not be moving to implement the Hamburg Rules until it is in the commercial interests of Australia to do so. In other words, there will be no moves towards implementation until the Hamburg Rules have come into force internationally and a sufficient number of our major trading partners have adopted, or expressed an intention to adopt, the Hamburg Rules as the basis for their marine cargo liability regimes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is obvious by the debate tonight that the opposition, the then government, still has the same view, and we certainly welcome that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides for regular ministerial reviews of the question of whether the amended Hague Rules, as they will be in COGSA after these amendments, should be replaced by the Hamburg Rules. These reviews must be done in consultation with the industry, which we obviously support. That gives credence to my comment that this government must continually maintain the flexibility to react to changes around the world with the countries we are dealing with. That is certainly going to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been prepared to address the situation, to avoid the trigger of those Hamburg Rules, to remain flexible and at the same time to implement this amending legislation so that we can provide better circumstances for shippers in Australia and a better opportunity as far as those arbitration requirements are concerned for shippers and shipowners. I am sure people will accept that this government has a very genuine attitude towards improving the movement of sea cargo in and out of Australia&mdash;as we have a view to reforming the entire transport sector in Australia for the betterment of the entire nation, not just for specific interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bill to the House. I also commend the opposition for supporting the bill. I again say that it is good to be debating a non-contentious bill in the chamber and not in the Main Committee. It is not that I have anything against the Main Committee, but it is good to have these sorts of debates down here&mdash;rather than just the normal, fairly vexatious, adversarial type debates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution will be brief, but I am pleased to make a short contribution to this important debate. The Carriage of Goods by Sea Amendment Bill is, in some parts, fairly technical but, as has been shown, it is a non-controversial piece of legislation. Indeed, as the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) has said, we are not always at each other's throats in this chamber. There are many issues, far more than people outside realise, which go through this House with bipartisan agreement. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6173"> opposition, as has been pointed out by the shadow minister, is supporting this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act gives effect in Australia to an international convention&mdash;that is, the amended Hague Rules&mdash;relating to liability or loss to marine cargo. It contains an automatic trigger which brings into force an alternative international regime, known as the Hamburg Rules, on 20 October 1997. From that point of view, there is a small degree of urgency. These rules were originally to take effect on 1 November 1994, but in October 1994, as the member for Lyne said, the parliament resolved to defer acceptance or repeal of the Hamburg Rules for a period of three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been pointed out by other speakers in this debate, the Hamburg Rules are typically favoured by cargo owners whereas the Hague Rules are preferred by operators. The principal difficulty, however, with the Hamburg Rules is that only 22 countries have implemented them and most of those countries are landlocked states in Central Africa. The rules are used by countries that amount to about one per cent of our international trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this legislation is to implement a package of enhancements to Australia's maritime liability regime. This legislation deals with liability for loss or damage to sea cargo. Herein lies my interest in this legislation: liability for loss or damage to sea cargoes. Mr Deputy Speaker, you should ask yourself: what causes damage to cargo on the high seas? What gives rise, therefore, to liability? So often it is the condition of the vessel and the competence, or the lack of competence, of the crew. This is an issue that many of us on this side of the House, no-one more than the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), have been arguing for some time. In fact, we have been arguing it for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must follow that, if you have a badly maintained vessel and a poorly trained crew, the possibility of loss and damage must be considerably enhanced. As is well known, the world's fleet is ageing. Few are building new ships and so often people are not attracted to the sea. There is no disputing the fact that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shipping is a competitive business and that corners are being cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has resulted in some very disturbing aspects in Australia. For example, the way some crews are treated has come to our attention. There is also the increasing occurrence of crews being of mixed races speaking many different languages. It often happens that you may have as a crew on a ship people of half a dozen different nationalities, all speaking different languages. This is, in effect, a way of controlling the crews, which has been shown in many cases recently.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Increasingly&mdash;and I have noticed this at Port Kembla&mdash;as my friends at the Mission to the Seaman also tell me&mdash;often when ships go there and pick up a crew there might be half a dozen different nationalities. Some of us suspect, indeed, some of us have evidence, that this is a method of controlling those crews.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this point, too, I cannot understand why this government is so keen to do away with cabotage and to open up our coastal routes to the rust buckets of the world. We are told so often that this will bring the cost of shipping down but, as far as I am concerned, that is a nonsense. It will not bring the cost of shipping down. When people say that bringing rust buckets crewed by people on starvation wages to take produce around the coastline will bring the cost of shipping down, they never say what the cost of the damage will be to the environment when something goes wrong. When we have the inevitable environmental disaster, someone is going to have to pay for it, and it will most likely be the Australian taxpayer. Therefore, instead of bringing the cost of shipping around the coastline down, this will actually increase it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the long term, it is better to have well&hyphen;maintained vessels crewed by well&hyphen;trained seafarers. If people want to cut costs&mdash;and I know there is an argument about smaller crews; I have seen ships in Denmark where they say they are going to have only five crew and things like that&mdash;it seems to me that, when ships are carrying expensive cargo, it is much better to have a smaller, but much better trained, crew. Therefore, if you have a large crew, and even if you are only paying 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6174"> them starvation wages, costs mount up. But, if you have a small, very highly trained crew, a competent crew, I am sure that that is what will bring the costs down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also indicate my total opposition to the suggestion of opening a second registry in Australia. I have never seen the benefit of this. It is more than a cost&hyphen;cutting measure; it is a tax avoidance measure. I think it was the honourable member for Shortland who touched on the possibility of increasing the number of Australian flagships. That is something that I have always supported and will continue to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did give the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson) my word that I would not go on too much about cabotage and ships of shame this evening. Having said that, I must say that I welcome this legislation. It is good that it is going through in a bipartisan way. It is important legislation, and I commend it to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

I believe that this is the chamber where we should be debating and discussing matters, and I have long held that view. It is important to very briefly take up the comments of the member for Throsby. It is a continuing theme: trying to link the winding back of cabotage to the introduction to our coastal trade of unseaworthy, rust bucket ships. He should be acutely aware of the fact that cabotage is a form of economic regulation and it is totally unrelated to the continuation of Australia's ship safety regime, which is administered by AMSA, the federal agency responsible for monitoring ship safety in Australian waters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure the member for Throsby that satisfactory standards of ship safety and crew welfare are of equal importance to the government as they are to the member for Throsby and, indeed, many other members in this House who have an ongoing interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 contains a number of elements. The first removes the provisions which would allow the determining officer to impose a fine on medical practitioners found to have engaged in overservicing. That is to clarify any concern regarding inappropriate use of judicial power. The only financial penalties are those relating to the repayment of medical benefits. The second element allows for an increase in the maximum periods of disqualification to three years full or partial exclusion from access to medical benefits. The third element allows committees to have access to documents subject to appropriate privacy provisions prior to the hearing. The fourth element clarifies possible confusion that the committee may use sampling techniques in assessing a practitioner's conduct, but may not choose to use such a technique. There has been some concern that in some way the committee is obliged to use those sampling 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> techniques, and the amendment is designed to make sure that that confusion is removed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final element allows a greater range of referrals to appropriate professional bodies, where inappropriate conduct is discovered. All of these changes are likely to improve the Commonwealth's ability to fairly, but firmly, police Medicare&mdash;and they therefore have the support of the Labor Party. The opposition will be supporting this bill for the reasons which have been outlined previously by the shadow minister for health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely vital that the community's longstanding confidence in Medicare and support for Medicare remain and, in so far as the bill seeks to prevent fraud and overservicing, the opposition believes that this is worthwhile legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time that the opposition supports efforts to ensure the integrity of Medicare, we remain very concerned about moves by the government and in particular the honourable member for Chisholm, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), to undermine Medicare. I wish to raise a number of concerns I have about the way the minister for health has handled his portfolio over the past 15 months because, if we are serious about maintaining the integrity of Medicare, the very least we should expect from the minister for health is consistency in the administration of his portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that Medicare is an extremely popular form of universal health insurance for Australians. In my electorate, between 1 July 1995 and 1 May 1996, almost 1.4 million Medicare services were provided. The vast majority of these claims are genuine and they represent a very significant reliance by Wills constituents on the Medicare system. It is worth noting that, of these claims, 80 per cent&mdash;or more than 1.1 million&mdash;were direct billed. It would be useful to obtain more information on Medicare claims for the sake of comparison, but the minister for health has proved himself very stubborn in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Thursday marks the first anniversary of a question on notice I asked of the minister concerning Medicare claims in his electorate. This question, No. 478, is not a difficult question but one he has refused to answer&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6176"> not on just one occasion, but on several. A letter from the Speaker and even a complaint to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about the minister's obstinacy have failed to move him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was at a loss to understand this reluctance by the minister to provide some simple information. But then it became clear. Why would he want to draw attention to Medicare claims in his own electorate when his closure of Medicare offices was going to hurt the very people he represents?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only a few weeks ago we learnt of his decision to close the Clayton Medicare office. Although located in the electorate of Hotham, the office services thousands of Chisholm families. After September, they will be forced to travel about seven kilometres to the nearest alternative Medicare office. The decision to close the Clayton Medicare office represents a betrayal of his electorate by the minister for health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from injecting certainty and integrity into Medicare, this short&hyphen;sighted decision does precisely the opposite. It erodes confidence in the system amongst an older community who are probably more reliant on that service than most Australians. Of course, this claim cannot be tested so long as the member for Chisholm fails to properly discharge his duties as a minister by answering question on notice No. 478.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The failure to answer a question on notice and the decision to close the Clayton Medicare office are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this minister. More serious is his total inability to explain why Ramsay Health Care Pty Ltd, a private health firm which donated $10,000 to the Liberal Party, showed up on the Liberal Party's Australian Electoral Commission return as operating from his electorate office taxpayer&hyphen;funded post office box.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has been asking us to believe that a Liberal Party functionary somehow mixed up the addresses of a private health firm based in South Melbourne with a Liberal Party MP's electorate office on the other side of Melbourne. Of all the addresses in the world to get mixed up, why would the Liberal Party have chosen the minister's taxpayer&hyphen;funded post office box? His explanation is totally unsatisfactory and if he wants the Australian community to retain any respect for him as health minister in what he is trying to achieve through this bill and other legislation, he ought to have the decency to offer a more credible explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While he is contemplating a more plausible explanation of his post office box, he might also like to offer an assurance that private sector health firm donations to the Liberal Party are not influencing his judgment as a minister. The same Australian Electoral Commission returns indicate that a company called the Prime Health Management Group donated $2,500 to the Liberal Party's federal secretariat. Amongst this company's directors is Dr David Adler&mdash;the same Dr David Adler recently appointed by the minister to the National Health and Medical Research Council. The minister should explain to this parliament that there was no connection between this appointment and the donation by the Prime Health Management Group to the Liberal Party. He should explain what the processes are in his office that ensure that there is no conflict of interest. We know from events of recent days what difficulty the

I believe that the majority of doctors carry out their duties properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, the minister insisted that the need for reform of psychiatric servicing was justified by rampant overservicing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I look back on my period of service and leadership as federal president of the Australian Medical Association, there are a number of things that stand out. Apart from activities in social and public health policy, if I were to nominate the things that I felt we had achieved in the two years that I was at the helm, it would be bringing the medical profession into the resource based relative values study, getting the general practice strategy up and underway, including divisions of general practice, bringing the medical profession to support the concept of informed financial consent in the private sector and the aggregation of billing procedures and, perhaps most importantly, bringing the medical profession into an area where previously it had not found itself able to go&mdash;that is, the development of the professional services review scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an AMA president in the early 1980s who agreed on national television that the amount of services provided in Australia each year which were unnecessary was in the vicinity of nine per cent. That president only served one year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he was health minister, Graham Richardson boldly claimed that the amount of overservicing in Australia was in the vicinity of $300 million a year. After some public debate with the AMA, he then downgraded his assessment to about $30,000 a year. Finally, by the time this legislation was introduced, he was prepared to say that he was not too sure how much it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was frequently asked, as I have over the years, what is overservicing&mdash;what exactly is it? It is very difficult to define. In fact, I used to say to the members of the association that it is a bit like pornography&mdash;it is hard to define but you sure know it when you see it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was president of the AMA, the medical profession was presented with the opportunity and responsibility of designing a system which would work, which was fair and which, hopefully, would get to the bottom of the problem. Graham Richardson was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6178"> refreshing in his approach to the ministry of health in that he gave us the opportunity to demonstrate that we could uphold the responsibilities that are the flip side of professional autonomy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would particularly like to pay tribute to Professor David Weedon, AO, who was then Vice-President of the AMA, Peter Arnold, who was then and still is the Chairman of the AMA Federal Council, and Dr Bill Coote, the Secretary-General of the AMA. Those people in particular ought to take some credit for this legislation and also for the amendments which, it seems, are going to be passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation, the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997, replaced the medical services committees of inquiry which were identified in the Australian National Audit Office report No. 17 as not adequately dealing with excessive servicing and as not operating satisfactorily. The report suggested strengthening the review process by increasing penalties, giving access to medical records to those who were reviewing the behaviour of doctors, creating additional committees to reduce time and delay and appointing a full&hyphen;time manager to examine the issue of inappropriate servicing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following lengthy negotiations with the government of the day, the Health Insurance Commission and professional groups, the professional services review legislation was born, based on the premise that a doctor should not be engaged in `inappropriate medical practice' defined in the Health Insurance Act 1973 as `conduct that is unacceptable to the general body of members of the profession or specialty in which the practitioner was practising when he or she rendered or initiated the services in question.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall at the time that within the medical profession there was much debate about this definition, the critics misconstruing the definition as relating to inappropriate medical practice in a purely medical sense. The definition relates more to abuse of public moneys, medical practices being the responsibility of state regulatory bodies such as medical boards. It is interesting that those who opposed it were, by and large, the very people about whom I and the AMA were most 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concerned. I found that those who railed and lobbied hardest against what we were trying to do were the very people that I felt, by and large, ought to be coming under its scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The HIC's responsibility under the scheme is to identify practitioners whose conduct causes concern. If there is no significant change in the practitioner's conduct after counselling by an HIC medical adviser, the doctor is referred to the director of the professional services review scheme. The director is a statutory officer, independent of the Health Insurance Commission. The director then considers the material provided by the HIC and may dismiss the case or, alternatively, empanel a committee to review and consider the behaviour of the doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A PSR committee consists of three members, doctors who are peers of the clinician who is under investigation. This is carried out in confidence and may involve access to patient records held by the doctor in question. If a finding of inappropriate medical practice is made, it is forwarded to a determining officer to fix a penalty. One of the criticisms that came, particularly from consumer organisations, against which the then minister, Graham Richardson, admirably held out, was that they felt it was inappropriate for doctors to be considering the behaviour of a doctor who had come to the attention of the Health Insurance Commission. I can only say that the only people who can really judge whether a professional person, in this case a doctor, has or has not done the right thing is a group of his or her own peers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that we would come up against was that doctors would turn up to medical committees into overservicing, as they existed before that, with a team of lawyers&mdash;the best lawyers that money could buy. It was very difficult to get to the bottom of the problem. Some practitioners would engage quite skilful and expensive lawyers and frustrate the entire process&mdash;effectively, a process which had been underfunded and which had been manned by well&hyphen;meaning, but basically part-time, individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once a determining officer has decided to fix a penalty, the doctor can then appeal  under this system to the Professional Services 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6179"> Review Tribunal, at which point the proceedings become public. The final avenue of appeal is to the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, what happens is that a statistical aberration of a medical practitioner's claims is detected by the Health Insurance Commission. It might be a practitioner who has a very large number of claims or, in some cases, it is a practitioner who has a very low number of claims. There is a popular view in the community that doctors who provide a lot of services are the ones who may not be doing the right thing. A proportion of them are not but we find&mdash;and I have found this over the years&mdash;there is as much inappropriate behaviour, if not impropriety, at the other end of the spectrum, where doctors are providing very few services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission looks at the statistical profile of the doctor and then brings that doctor to the attention of the medical advisers. The advisers then visit that doctor after having written to him or her. He or she is subject to counselling and, depending on the reaction of that doctor and the pattern of his or her practice, they may then subsequently be referred to a professional services review process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, if that doctor comes into the professional review services program, his or her behaviour is judged on a clinical basis. So it is a statistical problem that brings them into the system in the first place, but then it is their clinical behaviour as judged by their colleagues which determines their guilt or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of issues have been raised in relation to the legislation since it took effect&mdash;firstly, the definition of `peers'. Doctors who are vocationally registered general practitioners, for example, who have agreed formally to continuing medical education and quality assurance programs have been sitting in on judgments of GPs who are not vocationally registered. These amendments seek to formalise the categories of medical practitioners so that doctors feel in a real sense they are being judged by their own peers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have also been concerns about procedural fairness, including a concern regarding the ability of doctors acting as peers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> complying with the expected administrative law principles. The Attorney-General's Department will be providing committee members with advice and training&mdash;and that makes good sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have also been issues of cultural sensitivities. Some doctors from a certain cultural background other than, if you like, the dominant Anglo&hyphen;Celtic one felt that they should be judged by only doctors from their own cultural background. I have spoken to the professional services review director, who said that, following consultations with large groups of ethnic doctors in Australia, they are of the view, as I am, that in Australia we ought to practise medicine under one set of values and one set of standards and principles. Whether a person may be practising inappropriately is irrelevant to the cultural background of that doctor or indeed the cultural background of the patients which he or she is treating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, to deal with that a number of doctors from a range of cultural backgrounds are being added to the list of doctors from which panels may be put together. If, for example, a Vietnamese, an Egyptian or an Indian doctor is under inquiry, if it is possible and practicable a doctor from that cultural background would be added to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another criticism is that so far only GPs have been the subject of inquiry. Considering the number of panels that have been formed and the number of general practitioner services provided in Australia, that is probably not too surprising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent ANAO report concluded that the scheme is working and, importantly, that the HIC's approach to minimising inappropriate practice has addressed the criticisms identified in audit report No. 17 1992&hyphen;93 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medifraud and excessive servicing</EMPHASIS>, which gave birth to this entire process. Larger numbers are referred for disciplinary action than was the case under the previous scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the period since the PSR scheme commenced, 464 practitioners have been counselled. As of 28 May 1997, 82 referrals have been made by the commission to the director of the PSR, two of which he dismissed. The  PSR committees have prepared 23 reports and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6180"> the determining officer has made six final determinations. The Professional Services Review Tribunal has made two determinations, and currently two applications are before the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All practitioners referred to a PSR committee have been counselled by a medical adviser in the HIC and given the chance to change their pattern of practice. It is interesting that, following counselling and the opportunity to change their pattern of practice, about only 12 per cent of practitioners are subsequently referred to the director of the professional services review. It is interesting that the review has found that all practitioners against whom adverse findings have been made appear to show the characteristics of isolated medical practitioners, whatever their location&mdash;those who have little interaction with their professional peers and avoid collegiate activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A concern expressed which this bill seeks to address is that of constitutionality: whether judicial power is being exercised inappropriately by an officer of the executive. The bill amends the act to clarify and further delineate the powers of the determining officer and make it clear that he or she is not acting in a judicial capacity but making a determination on the advice of peer reviewers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further amendment will extend the possible period of a practitioner's disqualification from access to Medicare benefits from six months full disqualification and 12 months partial disqualification to a full three years. The reason for this extension and certainly why I support it is that the penalty should match the magnitude of inappropriate servicing, which may involve literally hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the determining officer has the discretion to deal with degrees of culpability, it is expected that, in cases where the determining officer considers there is a high degree of culpability, the full force of the sanctions in section 106U will be applied and a substantial proportion of the amount will be required to be repaid and a lengthy period of disqualification from Medicare benefits will be imposed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The professional services review, as I have said, is an improvement on the earlier system of having a medical services committee of inquiry, which relied on only a statistical sampling. It was necessary to look at only individual services provided to individual patients. So what happened was that we had people coming up before MSCIs who might have been accused by the commission of providing inappropriate services in 200 or more cases. The committees had to work through every single patient service that had been provided and quite high&hyphen;priced lawyers would sit on the other side of the table arguing the detail of every single case. So an important part of this legislation has been the capacity to use at least some degree of statistical sampling and, from that, try to make some judgments about the extent of inappropriate servicing and the recovery of Medicare benefits. A penalty could be applied in relation to only those services actually determined to be excessive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This system enables the medical profession and the Health Insurance Commission to take into account the entire pattern of practice of the doctor in question. For example, if a consultant psychiatrist were seeing 50 patients a day, that would raise some question about the quality of the service and indeed the detail that was being provided. The legislation has given the reviewers the capacity to take that into account as well as look at individual cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further significant aspect of this legislation, as I say, has been that a decision may be made on the basis of a statistically valid sample of services provided. But it has been infrequently used and in some cases it has been unworkable. In future the test will be for committees to reach an opinion regarding the practitioner's conduct in all cases rather than considering the appropriateness of individual services in some cases. The committee will report, setting out its findings on whether, in its opinion, the person under review engaged in inappropriate practice in connection with the referred services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new definition covered under section 82(1) of the bill brings definitions in line with recent amendments to the Health Insurance 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6181"> Act 1973 for consultants, physicians, specialist GPs and other practitioners, such as non-vocationally registered GPs and optometrists. The new definition will help the committee, the determining officer and the practitioners to better understand what constitutes inappropriate conduct. The Professional Services Review Tribunal makes its decisions on inappropriate practice based on processes of peer review and of evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting piece of research I did was to discover what proportion of services being referred to the professional services review was directly billed or bulkbilled. I have always been of the view that, when the patient consumes a service, providing only a Medicare card and making no financial contribution to it himself or herself, possibly such a system leads to the provisions of inappropriate services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that the proportion of bulkbilled services coming to the attention of the review process is in line with the proportion of bulkbilled services provided in the community generally. However, the practitioners providing privately billed services which are coming under the attention of the reviewers are practitioners who are privately billing but providing what can only be described as questionable services for certain ethereal sorts of diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I make is that I never had any interest in politics, other than my father's relationship with the Labor Party. But I never had any direct involvement. In 1988 I was practising medicine. I worked a 90&hyphen;hour week. I was not a member of the Australian Medical Association&mdash;like a lot of selfish young graduates; I regret that now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what spurred me into action was the former member for Canning, Mr George Gear. I will never forget one Saturday morning, getting up and seeing the headline in the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> that the average GP in Australia earned $126,500 a year. I was not earning anything like that. I went to work that Saturday morning and one of my patients said to me, `Brendan, what are you going to do with your $126,000 this year?' I was just so upset. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Mr Gear had sought to do, like some before him and some after him, was to build a career for himself on the denigration of a group of professionals, the vast majority of whom&mdash;as the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) said this evening&mdash;are good, decent, hardworking, honest people. I ask all members of the House, whether it be on my side or indeed on the other, to remember that, whilst we need to enthusiastically go after those who are providing inappropriate services, and certainly those providing them fraudulently, there are some values in this country that are worth upholding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those professional people&mdash;whether they be pharmacists, or doctors, or lawyers or anybody else&mdash;who commit themselves to an ethic of service to other people and place the interests of their clients or their patients ahead of their own deserve to be treated with respect. If we try to tear apart some of the values which actually got us to where we are in this country today, I think our ignorance of the consequences of that will be rather significant. There are few things that Australians can believe in today; but let us hope that confidence in professional people and perhaps the processes that support them, like this legislation, will remain one of them.</PARA></SPEECH>

Medicare, I understand, counts for over $6 billion worth of expenditure per annum and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme counts for over $2.3 billion per annum. So it is a very substantial amount, indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that for the 1996 financial year&mdash;they were the last figures I received&mdash;139 million Medicare services took place. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6182"> Seventy&hyphen;one per cent of all those were bulkbilled or direct billed. One can recall in the early days of Medicare the full&hyphen;page ads of many doctors opposing the introduction of Medicare and the consequences that it would have for them. I think the majority of even those would now favour the retention of the system in terms of the standard of public health it has provided in this country and in terms of the supply of respectable income that it generates for the great majority of doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian National Audit Office found in their <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 31 1996-97</EMPHASIS> that the fact that bulk-billing occurs has its own problems. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With direct billing the patient pays no money thus there is little incentive for the patient to verify the bill. Providers can add extra services to the claim on Medicare, or bill for a more expensive service than was provided. Both of these are common types of fraud.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I agree with the member for Bradfield that, while fraudulent and inappropriate practices do take place, it must be said that overall it is by a very insignificant minority of doctors&mdash;insignificant in terms of percentages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the ANAO found that somewhere between 1.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent of medical and pharmaceutical benefits payments are inappropriate payments, but that includes, as I understand it, payments made with respect to someone, for instance, who wins a workers compensation case and subsequently pays back the Health Insurance Commission. But even that 1.3 per cent to 2.3 per cent of inappropriate claims, given the massive amount of money that is provided to Australians for medical services, constitutes a significant sum of money. It is somewhere between $110 million and $190 million a year of inappropriate payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the opposition strongly support any measures that are required, even if they are stricter measures, that give viability and efficacy to a system which we say is vital to the health of Australians. As the member for Bradfield indicated, there has been some success in stemming the extent of fraud and excessive servicing. The action has become increasingly sophisticated since the ANAO report No. 17 on medifraud and excessive 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> servicing in 1992&hyphen;93 which, the member for Bradfield indicated, resulted in the enforcement regime which is in place at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It resulted in the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994, which established both a system of counselling&mdash;an independent peer review&mdash;and a system for the imposition of a penalty if the matter could not be resolved up until that point of time, which the member for Bradfield, given his background, was able to so thoroughly discuss. But the ANAO, when they analysed those enforcement procedures more recently in their 1996-97 report No. 31, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concerns expressed in report No. 17 1992-93 of a lack of disciplinary action against practitioners suspected of overservicing no longer apply.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I note the member for Bradfield graciously gave credit to the role of former Senator Graham Richardson in terms of the origins of the enforcement and review system. Indeed, I understand that in 1995-96 over $1 million was recovered from inappropriate services and, in 1994-95, just under $1 million of inappropriate Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits payments was recovered on behalf of the Australian taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A more recent and perhaps dramatic example is a situation involving Dr James Tankey. The Professional Services Review Tribunal directed the repayment of in excess of $580,000 from the one practitioner. I will not comment on the merits of that case because I understand that Dr Tankey is following his appeal rights, and it is inappropriate that the merits of the case be further discussed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that I am making is that the procedure does have some teeth in it in terms of the global sum that can be recovered, and indeed the sum that can be recovered from individual practitioners is significant indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, the opposition supports the bill because, in its implementation, some difficulties have been revealed. Firstly, the bill removes the power of the determining officer to impose a fine, thus ensuring, as the member for Bradfield indicated, that there isn't that blurring of the administrative and judicial functions which our constitution requires to be kept separate to protect the civil rights of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6183"> any individual who may face arbitrary or capricious administrative action. They should have their separate rights of appeal through the legal processes, and that is an appropriate distinction to restore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Partly in order to offset the inability to impose a fine, the bill, the opposition agrees, appropriately imposes a longer period of disqualification&mdash;or at least the power to give a longer period of disqualification&mdash;for up to three years full or partial exclusion from access to Medicare benefits. Again, that is in contrast to the initial position taken by doctors in the period of the Whitlam government and in the early days of the Hawke government when they vigorously opposed the Medicare procedure. It is interesting to note that one of the penalties imposed now by their peers is a preclusion from access to that very system that so many of them opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Be that as it may, the bill appropriately addresses, as I have emphasised, compliance measures. The bill imposes greater penalties for failure to produce documentation as, one would appreciate, the assessment of these doctors' conduct and their methodology of practice necessarily depends upon documentary evidence. If they were able to prevent access to that documentation, obviously it would make the task of considering their practice extremely difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But at the same time, the bill appropriately recognises that a medical practitioner has the ability to claim the privilege against self-incrimination in circumstances where that medical practitioner was going to face criminal charges. As I understand it, no such criminal charges have resulted from these procedures, although obviously there are significant civil penalties that can occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also clarifies, as the member for Bradfield indicated, the ability of the professional review committee to use sampling techniques rather than being required to analyse every piece of paper relating to the service provided by the medical practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that some doctors under investigation have argued that, because the scheme provided for sampling, sampling was mandatory, requiring the review procedure to literally analyse every piece of paper. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Bradfield, in his experience, was able to recount the situation where lawyers would, in effect, run interference on the review procedure by scrutinising and disputing the review of each and every service. The bill appropriately enables the committee to use sampling techniques but it is in a discretionary sense; it is not mandatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must agree with the comments of the member for Bradfield that, while the system requires constant vigilance because the very small minority of practitioners who will abuse the system will always attempt to push out the boundaries, just as happens in the case of tax law, it casts a corresponding obligation on the government of the day and the public servants charged with the administration of the system to look at what is going on and modify, refine and strengthen, if need be, to ensure that our extremely valued Medicare system continues. Indeed, fortunately, the Medicare system appears to be becoming one of the Holy Grail items in Australian politics. Even the conservative government before the last election had as their policy the retention of the Medicare system. We on this side of the House hope that it is not watered down in terms of any supplementary payments that are imposed as a result of government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill itself indicates the very significant role of the Health Insurance Commission in administering the system. Indeed, it is a very essential role in the counselling procedures. It is a pivotal role. In that context I can understand an answer to a question on notice which I received from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) earlier in the year. I asked the minister whether he would consider opening a Medicare office in Kogarah in my electorate of Barton, there already being one in Rockdale. The minister advised me that there were some 200 doctors who had their principle place of practice in the Kogarah post code, which was the eighth largest district in metropolitan Sydney and, I gather, one of the largest in Australia. Of course, in my electorate, very close to my electorate office, are both the St George Public Hospital and the St George Private Hospital, which opened in November 1995. So in summary, it is a very significant area 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6184"> for the provision of medical services. Given that, I asked the minister whether he would open a Medicare office and the minister replied to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, the establishment of a Medicare Customer Service Centre is determined by the Health Insurance Commission according to strict guidelines. Such decisions are made independently of Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On receiving the answer to that question, I let the issue lie, it being indicated to me that the Health Insurance Commission was autonomous on these matters, that is, the location of their Medicare offices, and given, as this bill indicates, their central and pivotal role in the overall enforcement of the Medicare system, one might consider that that autonomy was not inappropriate. Given the minister's answer to me, however, and his specific statement in the answer, and indeed on the record of the House, that decisions regarding the location of Medicare offices are made independently of government but rather determined by the Health Insurance Commission, I was perhaps more astounded than any member of this House when I received notification that some 17 Medicare offices, including the Medicare office in my electorate of Barton, were to be closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall the minister, in an answer to a question without notice from one of the coalition members, openly stating the policy of the government regarding the closure of Medicare offices had been motivated by a government policy decision to provide Medicare offices in regional Australia. One might say that regional Australia has a predominance of conservative party electorates, but I was so astounded because it was entirely inconsistent with the advice I had received from the minister that the location of Medicare offices was a matter within the autonomy of the Health Insurance Commission with decisions to be made independently of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was taught a motto by the senior partner of my legal firm, Roy Turner, where I spent my time in professional practice&mdash;when your neighbour starts preaching self&hyphen;righteousness, that is the time to count your sheep. Regrettably, that has been revealed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can recall the white board episode, involving former sports minister Ros Kelly, when it was alleged that she had allocated funds to marginal electorates. How more culpable is the conduct of this minister when he said, on the record, that the role for determining the allocation of Medicare offices was a matter for the autonomy of the Health Insurance Commission? If those on the opposite benches described those allocations of sports grants as a rort, I will let those words fall where they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having expressed my disappointment at losing the only remaining Medicare office in my electorate of Barton, given the very high profile of medical services, it is important, as the opposition agrees, that the overall viability of the Medicare system continue. The opposition supports these measures to strengthen and refine the enforcement and review procedures contained in the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to support the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997. I shall not be taking all of the time allocated to me tonight; I simply wish to put some matters on the record from my electorate. I concur with what the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) has said about tidying up and making better the practice that is already in place. It is about ensuring that there is a common standard in Australia that all doctors adhere to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Especially in the age of computers, when all records are documented, Medicare charges are easily accessed and anomalies in any statistics are easily brought to light. I think it serves as a good warning for people who think that they can rort the system to know that they cannot, because people are watching and it gets easier day by day to find anomalies. That is what this bill does. If a statistical anomaly pops up that says, `That is outside the normal range for a doctor,' then it should be investigated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An average GP will see 120 patients a week. In fact, the Health Insurance Commission in 1994 paid one doctor for seeing 600 patients a week. In some instances, the HIC has alleged inappropriate billing only when a doctor has claimed to work more than 24 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6185"> hours a day. It is a matter of moving away from those fast services, where centres can bulk&hyphen;bill and shove patients through like in a sausage factory and we end up with very short, sharp and careless service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other end of the scale, a number of complaints have been brought to my attention recently about one doctor in my electorate who will be seeing between 50 per cent to 55 per cent of patients within the next seven days. That is a practice that doctors can be counselled against, so they send someone on their way and say, `Come back and see me if you don't feel well,' compared to making an appointment for them and saying, `You will come back and see me next week.' People rely on their doctors. If a doctor says that they need to see you again, by and large most people will come back and see them. As the member for Bradfield has put forward, it is very important that this does not lead into a doctor bashing episode. It certainly is not designed as such.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only by the majority of doctors falling within the large section of the bell curve that we are able to identify the anomalies. With the new procedure of counselling coming in, a doctor's practice can be examined. Quite frequently, where people have been put through a sausage factory type clinical examination and have an ailment that is difficult to diagnose, they will see several doctors and be unhappy with the diagnosis. They finally will be referred to someone who has a reputation for being able to diagnose. Obviously the diagnostics of that doctor will be above the norm. That is to be expected and will be catered for in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It costs in the region of $120,000 just to keep your practice open. So a tremendous incentive is there for a doctor who is not paying practice costs to throughput patients. That is to be discouraged. Certainly, if you are doing genuine clinical diagnostics work on very difficult patients, that will come out in any subsequent interviews with the counsellors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I would like to emphasise is that a number of people in my electorate have complained to me that it is very difficult to get home visits today. In my region, public 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> transport is not always that good. Not everyone has access to cars, especially for spouses where one takes a car to work. A significant proportion of doctors record no home visits. That is a statistic which is clearly available through the Medicare billing system and can be brought to light.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are a number of things that we can now monitor with computers through the billing system that is in place in Australia, and I think it is very important that we do that. While the Medicare levy is 1.5 per cent of taxable income, it accounts for only eight per cent of the cost of medical services. Those medical services will only get more and more expensive as things like MRI become more commonplace than, say, X-rays and we move up to the Rolls Royce of medical technology from systems that we have been using for a while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Diagnostic techniques and treatments are getting more expensive and more technologically advanced, and that costs money. So I do not see that in the future our health bills necessarily will come down. We certainly have to work at getting the best use for money that we possibly can. That includes closing down any avenues for people to rort the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill goes some way to doing that. No doubt in future, as further rorts appear, we will have to make a further effort. There is always that very small minority who bring any profession into disrepute. It is most unfair to label all doctors with the same tar brush when examining this bill. It is a small part of the move by our Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) towards a better health system which will function for Australians in my electorate and will serve us well through to the next century. The minister is to be commended on his efforts, and I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 1) introduces a series of technical amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973. It also seeks to improve the performance of the professional service review scheme, the PSRS. The scheme was established under the previous Labor administration to ascertain whether 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6186"> a person rendering services for which a Medicare rebate is paid is involved in inappropriate practice. Inappropriate practice is defined in the principal act as `conduct that is unacceptable to the general body of the members of the professional speciality in which the practitioner was practising when he or she rendered or initiated the services in question.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most common form of inappropriate practice in Australia is overservicing. It is indefensible. The characteristics of overservicing, which include inadequate consultation time, incomplete examination of the patient and the lack of definitive diagnosis, increase the margin for error in the care of the patient. At first blush, that might be thought to be underservicing, but it leads to more consultations than if adequate time was spent in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is widely accepted by the bulk of medical practitioners that adequate time needs to be spent with a patient to ensure that a high level of care is administered. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners noted in a 1996 publication that, while individual consultation times vary according to clinical need, the average consultation time should be no less than 10 minutes. This minimum standard has been ignored by every one of those general practitioners who have in the past been deemed to overservice patients by the PSRS. As the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) rightly observed in his second reading speech, `a high throughput of patients is also detrimental to the financial state of our ailing health system.' This was borne out by the 1995&hyphen;96 annual report produced by the director of the professional services review scheme. Detailed case studies of those who had come under review for `inappropriate practice' in that year were presented in the report, as is the legal requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Case A provided information on one practitioner who had performed in excess of 19,500 services in the referral year, attracting a total Medicare payment of approximately $425,000. In another instance, a general practitioner's referral record showed claims for more than 27,000 services for 5,500 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> patients in one year at a cost to Medicare of $581,000. On 140 occasions in the year being investigated, this doctor had claimed for more than 100 services each day. The same practitioner had also claimed for in excess of 140 services per day on 26 occasions. One especially busy day saw this individual claim for 181 services. A third example cited in the report provided information about a GP who had claimed $396,000 in Medicare benefits for more than 18,600 services performed on only 3,661 patients. The same doctor had claimed for approximately 500 home consultations over the course of that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Invariably, general practitioners who have been investigated by the PSRS have argued that long working hours and efficient work habits explain their high throughput of patients. This justification has not yet been accepted by any review committee. Overservicing should not be and is not being tolerated, either within the medical fraternity or by the general community. The establishment of the PSRS, which became operational on 1 July, 1994, sent an unequivocal message to the Australian medical profession that overservicing was not acceptable. The purpose of the review scheme is to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . examine, impartially and expeditiously, cases of suspected inappropriate practice by the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is based on a peer review process, which is vital to ensure impartiality and differentiate between the separation of judicial and executive powers. The government has claimed that this separation of powers is the key to the success of the review scheme and, on this point, I believe the government to be right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, in his second reading speech, implied that overservicing in Australia is the product of an increase in doctor numbers. He said that inappropriate medical practice has:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . been highlighted in recent times as the oversupply in medical practitioners . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say that it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . places greater pressure on practitioners to increase patient throughput and, in some cases, engage in significant overservicing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">His position was reinforced by the director of the professional services review scheme&mdash;who, incidentally, is a ministerial appoint 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6187"> ment&mdash;in his 1995&hyphen;96 annual report. The director wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committees have considered that practitioners can control their practice numbers and that there is the likely driving factor of monetary reward for such behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to make two points about that. The first is about the number of medical professionals involved in overservicing. If, as the minister would have us believe, an oversupply of doctors is the reason for this practice, one might expect to see a large number of medical practitioners come under the scrutiny of the PSRS for overservicing. That is simply not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As at March, 1997, a total of only 35 cases had come under investigation. In the year 1995&hyphen;96, the director of PSRS received 16 referrals of suspected inappropriate practice. All of these involved medical practitioners in general medical practice. In that same year Health Insurance Commission figures show that a total of 19,652 general practitioners made claims on the HIC. Put another way, less than 0.1 per cent of doctors in general practice came under scrutiny by the PSRS because of overservicing in 1995&hyphen;96. This data simply does not support the minister's assertion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The September&hyphen;October edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Private Doctor</EMPHASIS> had this to say on the issue of an excess of doctors:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GPs are said to earn approximately $160,000 pa; although less than some specialists, these are hardly poverty levels which might be expected in an oversupply situation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One would expect that in any other business, an oversupply of service providers would result in a drop in average incomes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government should not use overservicing as a justification for restricting service provider numbers. In restraining supplier numbers, the government is tackling only one side of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to my second point. The 1997 report into private health insurance by the Productivity Commission made it clear that the demand side of the equation also requires recalibration. The report noted:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian health care system has traditionally combined fee-for-service medicine with payment of the largest part of health care bills by a third party&mdash;the government (taxpayers) or private insurers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inherent in the system is a tendency for overuse, where patients receive services which they value at less than the cost of provision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Restricting service provider numbers will not introduce a greater cost consciousness into the system, and that is what is desperately required. The government must instead implement policies which encourage immediate and ongoing participation in private health care funds. The Productivity Commission found that households in the wealthiest and poorest income brackets suffered from the lowest drop in private health insurance membership since 1983. It is middle income Australia that needs to be wooed away from its dependence on publicly funded health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Institute of Family Studies found that by the year 2041 there will be 36 senior citizens and 29 child dependants for each 100 people of work force age. Put another way, 35 per cent of our future population will bear responsibility for the care of the remaining 65 per cent, if attitudes toward individual financial independence do not change significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's decision to penalise medical professionals who participate in overservicing is supportable. But I say again that the restriction of service provider numbers will not introduce into the system a greater cost consciousness by patients. This is an entirely different matter that needs to be dealt with immediately and more thoroughly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has suggested that this legislation will tighten up certain procedural aspects of the PSRS. That is good policy. However, I am concerned by the subjective terminology that plagues both the explanatory memorandum and the bill itself. Subdivision B remakes certain paragraphs of the principal legislation to allow the PSRS to access documents before a hearing into inappropriate practice commences. Permitting advance access to records that may substantiate overservicing is also supportable. However, new subsection 105A(4) allows for documents 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6188"> to be inspected and retained by the PSRS `for a reasonable period'. What exactly does this mean?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly subjective language is used in the explanatory memorandum to define the additional powers being bestowed on the determining officer under this legislation. It is proper that anyone in the medical profession who is found guilty of inappropriate practice should be required to pay the Commonwealth an amount equivalent to the whole, or at least part, of the Medicare benefit paid to them. But this bill means to give the determining officer&mdash;who, like the director, is appointed by the minister&mdash;the `discretion' to deal with `degrees of culpability' in this instance. The determining officer will decide whether a `substantial proportion' of the money claimed will have to be repaid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I maintain that it is appropriate that anyone found to have been involved in inappropriate practice be compelled to repay the money to the Commonwealth. However, I fail to see how providing the determining officer with the power to determine `substantial proportions' in any way `provides a clearer approach to calculating the amounts of Medicare benefits to be repaid', as the minister claimed will be the case. This change is supportable, but it is not likely, using again the minister's words, to `improve the administration of the process of reviewing a practitioner's conduct', as the minister would like to suggest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the determining officer will have the discretion to decide if the practitioner is disqualified, for Medicare purposes, for `a long period'. Subsection 106U(3) of the bill will extend the maximum period of partial disqualification from Medicare to three years. Full disqualification is also being extended, under subsection 106U(4), from the current limit of six months to a new maximum of three years. Only those medical professionals abusing the medicare system will have cause to argue against the more severe penalties, of course. What I find objectionable is the fact that the determining officer will have the authority to interpret the meaning of disqualification for a `long time'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum states that overservicing should not be condoned and that the practice warrants `strong action' at the `top end' of the measures provided. I do not sanction overservicing&mdash;and that is apparent from what I have already said&mdash;but it is not satisfactory that such loosely defined terms as `strong action' and `top end' frequent this legislation. These phrases should be reviewed and replaced with very specific alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is strange that the government has seen fit to introduce amendments that, on the one hand, consolidate the separation of the judicial and executive power, but will simultaneously provide the determining officer with greater discretionary power. It defies logic. It is not consistent thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The professional services review scheme has stated that the key features to its success include impartiality, privacy, competence and timeliness. Any measure that further finetunes these features should be viewed favourably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is correct to take stronger action against medical professionals who abuse their position of responsibility. But I remind the House of a press release issued on 2 June 1995 by the then shadow minister for health and human services, the now Minister for Health and Family Services. He had this to say when commenting on the OECD report into Australia's treatment of general practitioners:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GP's seem to be seen in the report as cost irritants for the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits schedules, rather than being recognised for their value in primary health care delivery.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government would do well to keep that in mind when it next seeks to draw a tenuous link between practices like overservicing and the restriction of doctor supplier numbers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6189">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be recognised that medical practitioners do have a privileged position in any society. A society rightly values doctors and those who&mdash;through their expertise, training and experience&mdash;gain skills which can help to save and improve quality of life for many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of government's and a state's most fundamental tenets is the protection and wellbeing of its citizens. That is why the health care system and the role that medical practitioners play in that system are so fundamentally important. Other speakers have highlighted the current state of the Medicare system. This government has pledged to continue to support Medicare, yet the system we inherited from the former Labor government&mdash;with spiralling outlays&mdash;must be looked at very closely if we are to give it the degree of support we should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has to recognise that currently some $7.6 billion is paid out annually by way of Medicare rebates. Therefore, the government&mdash;in implementing its election promise to maintain and improve Medicare&mdash;must reign in expenditure wherever that is possible. That is one of the reasons that this government is seeking to tighten the professional services review scheme&mdash;to make sure those very few medical practitioners who abuse the system are not able to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inappropriate medical practice is a matter of concern for not only this government but any government, and clearly what we need to have in place is a procedure where we are able to identify those medical practitioners who are not practising appropriately so they are not able to rort the system. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) pointed out that only a tiny proportion of doctors are in that category, and I would think most medical practitioners would be absolutely appalled at the practices of a small number of their colleagues. Of course, those practices have meant that this government has had to introduce the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I was interested to hear the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) mention an Ipswich medical practitioner, Dr James Tankey. While I do not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> intend to canvass at length the circumstances of his particular case&mdash;given the fact he has appealed to the Federal Court&mdash;I hope that the Professional Services Review Tribunal has not only been seen to carry out justice but has carried out justice as far as Dr Tankey is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know Dr Tankey personally, but I did practise law in the same city where Dr Tankey was a medical practitioner. I must say that the impression I had from my clients was that Dr Tankey was a well&hyphen;regarded medical practitioner. When he received the penalty which was handed down to him, there was a sense of shock in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that, when one looks at the facts&mdash;that is, that he was ordered to repay $580,576 and was prevented from continuing to access the Medicare system for a period of six months&mdash;one would think that, clearly, there must have been circumstances which brought about such a penalty. Tribunal hearings were told that in 1994 Dr Tankey provided more than 27,000 Medicare consultations and his daily workload covered up to 182 patients. I must say, as an individual, that I find it very difficult to understand&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Tankey has been our family doctor for the past six years. When it comes to medical treatment, we tend to be very discerning, as we are with most things. We have moved around a fair bit and have had dealings with more than a dozen GPs. Dr Tankey is the best of them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case before the professional service review, there was no suggestion of fraud and no evidence 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6190"> of anyone suffering ill&hyphen;effects while under the care of the man. The tribunal has essentially punished a talented, workaholic doctor for working too hard.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then Mr Rodgers goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the busy nature of the surgery, patients do not feel they are being rushed. Some things you go to the doctor for require only a five-minute consultation. From my experience, Dr Tankey has always been happy to leave 30 people waiting so he can give the required attention to an individual patient. This individual attention extends to taking phone calls from patients and being available day and night. Some doctors will try to shove a Medicare machine under your nose if you ask them about the weather. I have received advice from Dr Tankey over the phone on many occasions and not been charged for it. At least twice he has opened his surgery late at night for us in emergencies. No aspect of his practice gives the impression of being money driven.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  the day before, 22 April, had another story, this time by P. Hammond, which pointed out that the Deputy Mayor of Ipswich had joined hundreds of citizens to support a family doctor&mdash;that is, Dr Tankey&mdash;who had the problems I outlined a moment ago. I do not intend to say any more about Dr Tankey, but I would ask the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for an assurance that the Professional Services Review Tribunal is in fact as fair as the former government expected it to be when it set it up and this government would expect it to be now that we are continuing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I obviously find it very difficult to understand how any medical practitioner could have seen the number of patients Dr Tankey was reported to have seen. But it does seem to be very interesting that, in the investigation of Dr Tankey's practice, there does not seem to be any evidence of fraud, any evidence of malpractice or any evidence of dissatisfied patients coming forward to complain about the medical practitioner. One would have thought that, if the medical practitioner was as bad as the penalty would indicate, there would be a host of dissatisfied patients out there in the community prepared to give evidence against him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support what this government is seeking to do in this bill. It is obvious that with finite expenditure this government is only able to spend as much money on Medicare as is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> absolutely necessary. We have an extraordinarily generous universal health system which guarantees all people medical and hospital treatment regardless of their circumstances. In a compassionate society, very few people would disagree with this proposal. It is, therefore, incumbent on governments to make sure that the system is not being rorted, that the system is not being abused. That is why the former government brought in the professional services review scheme in 1995, supported by us, and this is why we are tightening it, reviewing it and improving it, supported by the opposition at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inappropriate medical practice must always be identified and must always be penalised. It concerns me that we obviously must have a system to root out inappropriate practice but, on the other hand, I look at the circumstances of Dr Tankey and, I must say, am left not really understanding just where the right and the wrong of the situation is. I hope that Dr Tankey has not been made a scapegoat by the tribunal. I look forward to the minister's assurance in relation to this particular point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did have quite a long speech, but the minister has given me an indication that he would like to sum up to permit our colleagues to participate in the adjournment date.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) for his courtesy. The professional services review scheme was introduced in 1994. It was designed to combat overservicing in the Medicare program, including in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It is necessary to finetune the legisla 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6191"> tion in light of the first two years of the operation of this scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three types of amendments in this bill. The first is the major motivation for the amendments to the legislation&mdash;that is, to clarify that the judicial power is not being exercised by the executive under this scheme by removing the ability to recover an amount in addition to any Medicare benefits paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other major amendments are designed to define the classes of practitioners so they are consistent with the Health Insurance Act 1973, enabling a better test to be applied in terms of a practitioner's conduct and, as a consequence, to clarify the test under which a committee reports on the conduct of a practitioner, to remove the statistical sampling provisions which have proved to be unworkable in practice and to increase the partial and full disqualification periods from access to Medicare up to a maximum of three years in both cases. The third type of amendment makes minor changes to improve the administration of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme is the government's primary means of investigating allegations of inappropriate practice and taking action where those allegations are proven through the administrative review process. General practitioners accounted for $3.4 billion of the $6 billion of government expenditure for Medicare in 1995-96. To put that in some context, we spend about the same amount on Medicare benefits as the budget of the state of Western Australia, and GP expenditure is over half of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any scheme of this sort, it is necessary to strive to develop a review process which is both fair and equitable to individual practitioners and the community as a whole. It is important to ensure that Australian taxpayers receive value for their Medicare dollar while at the same time ensure that practitioners obtain procedural fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my view that the overwhelming majority of medical practitioners are absolutely honest. The number of practitioners who will appear before this tribunal is very small, but there has to be the capacity to deal with those practitioners who are operating in a way that is unacceptable to the vast majority of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> medical profession. That is what this scheme is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a scheme that is run by government. It is a scheme where a medical practitioner is judged by his or her peers as to what practice is appropriate. That is not a decision government should make, but maybe a practitioner's peers do have the right to say that a person practising three&hyphen; to four&hyphen;minute medicine, a person who does not keep notes, a person who may not appropriately treat their patients, a person who may not practise preventative medicine, may not be an appropriate person to be earning $400,000 to $500,000 a year. I think that is eminently reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure practitioners obtain fairness in the scheme, the review process has a practitioner counselled more than once by medical advisers in the Health Insurance Commission and given a chance to change the way they practice. They are given every opportunity to call their own witnesses and to make submissions before a committee of peers, including having a solicitor present at the review to provide advice. They are able to make submissions on a draft determination before the determining officer has made a final determination. They are able to appeal to the Professional Services Review Tribunal the determining officer's decision, be legally represented at the tribunal and be able to appeal to the Federal Court on any errors of law considered to have been made at any of these stages. I would think most people would think this to be very fair and reasonable. The scheme in the end aims to achieve a proper balance between the rights of the individual practitioner and the community's needs as a whole to ensure that Medicare dollars are wisely spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank honourable members for their contributions and for the overall support of the House for this piece of legislation. I will just comment briefly on a number of areas that were raised. The first is that a number of honourable members raised a specific practitioner who has been before this process. It would be improper for me, as health minister, to comment on a specific case, except to say that, in this case, the practitioner has been judged by his peers, not by the government. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6192"> If, indeed, an error of law has been made, that will be determined by the courts, not by the political system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second comment that I would like to make is to reply to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) who, in his contribution, talked very much about the demand side of medicine and then finished by saying that there was a tenuous link between medical costs and supply. I understand the member for Curtin's comments. Many economists feel this way. Demand is a fashionable thing to talk about in economics today; supply is not. Of course, if we were talking 20 years ago, it would have been the reverse. It would have been very fashionable to talk about supply and not talk about demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that if you believe the OECD&mdash;and I do&mdash;70 per cent of the increase in health costs between 1961 and 1997 were generated on the supply side. This is not surprising. There are two factors that operate in health that are different from hiring a taxi or buying a hot dog on a beach&mdash;both of which are examples that respected economists use, but seem not to be able to extend to health. The first is that there is a great degree of emotion involved in health and, in economic terms, that means there is demand inelasticity. People demand more of the product regardless of the price. So normal demand signals do not have as big an impact here as they might have if we were merely buying hot dogs on a beach or catching a taxi.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second aspect about health economics is that there is a big mismatch between the information providers have and the information consumers have. Normal markets, as we understand them today, rely on information balance between those purchasing and those providing. That is clearly not the case in health. In health, a pensioner is not going to see a doctor, walk out with a prescription and then, having looked at it&mdash;they will be lucky to be able to read the handwriting&mdash;say, `Well, I'm not really $3.20 sick. Scripts have gone up 50c; I'll stick it in the bin.' Consumers do not have information, so most of the costs in health are driven on the supply side. I could not pretend that demand does not have any effect but, in the end, if you do not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> get a hold on supply, you do not get a hold on health costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had dinner a couple of weeks ago with the South African health minister, Dr Zuma. We were talking about new technology. She was telling me that Johannesburg has about the same number of MRI scanners as Australia. She was lamenting the fact that her 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old daughter had gone to school and, during the day, developed a headache. Had that happened in Australia, her daughter would have gone to the sick bay, been given two aspirins and sent home. Dr Zuma's daughter went to the sick bay and was then sent to the public hospital for an MRI scan. By the time she got home at 4 o'clock, she had had the scan&mdash;which, of course, was absolutely normal. Dr Zuma is wondering why she has a problem with costs in the South African health system! I think I was able to tell her why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I was not here for the comments of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) but it is hard to see how they fit within the scope of this bill. Obviously, the Deputy Speaker at the time allowed a wide ranging debate. He used the privilege of this House to cast aspersions on me because of a donation made to the Liberal Party. I will leave it up to him and his constituents to make the decision as to whether it is appropriate for him to have his staff members using the resources of the Parliamentary Library to trawl through donors to the Liberal Party, and whether they think it is appropriate to use this forum to make an attack on a person's character. All I will say is that I would suggest to the honourable member for Wills and his staff that they be very confident of their own behaviour before they decide to do that, because two people can play that game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would further say, for the record, that there was an instance where the federal Liberal Party sent a return into the Electoral Commission of donors to the party. One of them did include my post office box; that was news to me. I checked with the Liberal Party. It was an oversight and a mistake on their part, and I understand that it has been corrected. The member for Wills may seek to take short&hyphen;term advantage on this, but I think 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6193"> that when he has been here a little bit longer&mdash;he has not been here very long at all&mdash;he may learn that those things, in the end, come back to bite him.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to talk about a topic that seems fairly topical in the House at the moment: the question of stress, particularly in the public sector. In doing so, I want to refer to an article that appeared in a longstanding and reputable community newspaper circulated in my electorate, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Valley View</EMPHASIS> , on 3 June. It was written by one of the family counsellors employed by the Tuggeranong Community Service, a longstanding and efficient service. I think we all have similar services in our electorates. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hot in the media of late is the high stress rate of Canberra's public servants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would seem in our current economic state that whatever stress existed before would be now be heightened by the pressures of finances, job security and future prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be extremely difficult for many people to go to work each day feeling positive and with energy, not to mention dedication and a sense of enjoyment.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We all carry the burden, and at times, injustices of today's climate, and I am sure each of us can justify good reason to feel drained and worn down. But what is happening on the other side of the fence? By this I mean for the family member holding the fort when we leave the house each 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> morning to attend another day `at the office'. This family member plays a valuable role in the lives of those of us who are in paid work&mdash;for they are the ones who get to hear about our terrible days, about the difficulties we may have or the challenges we may face.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I use that quote for a very specific purpose. The Leader of the House, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), has gone to some trouble in the last few days to point out&mdash;probably correctly&mdash;some rorting that appears to have gone on within some areas of the public sector in relation to stress claims for compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst not for one moment condoning or wishing to condone that sort of practice, there is a reality that we must all face: as a government you cannot approach the public sector&mdash;and, in fact, a community like Canberra&mdash;as this government has over the past 15 months and not see an unbelievable increase in stress and trauma that families in my electorate and throughout Canberra are now facing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who have maintained employment do it at a cost. The cost is the family, the demeanour of the family, the life of the family and the health of the family. A woman walked into my office two weeks ago. She was at the end of her tether. Her husband is lucky. He has maintained a position in the public sector in Canberra, but he is doing the work previously done by five people. We could laugh, scoff and say, `There must have been four not needed' but I think that is a bit of a cop&hyphen;out. What we are looking at is what is happening to her children and herself as a result of her husband's stress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another example. A personal friend of mine had been working in the computer area of a public sector department for some time. All of the computer work in that department was sold off&mdash;contracted out&mdash;and he was paid out. He is a family man with two children, a 10&hyphen;year&hyphen;old and an eight&hyphen;year&hyphen;old, and a wife. Since that happened, he has been fortunate. The company that took over the computing services for the department employed him, but he is now working 12 to 14 hours a day, five days a week, plus at least one compulsory full day every weekend, with no additional compensation. The stress that that family is now under is enormous.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to recognise and acknowledge a very brave young lady in my electorate; someone who, in spite of the most unimaginable odds, has managed to cling onto life and&mdash;with the wonderful support of her mother and a caring community&mdash;is now well advanced on her long road to recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the evening of 6 October last year, while walking home along a main road in Cairns, 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Cleis Norbury was brutally bashed and left to die, lying in a pool of blood. She spent the next few weeks in a coma in Townsville Hospital's head injury unit, with her mother, Rhonda, always by her side, hoping, praying and wondering if&mdash;against all odds&mdash;she would ever recover. Doctors believed that she would not. But she did, and, over the past few months, Cleis has continued to fight against the odds and is now walking, talking and improving all the time&mdash;leaving her mum and the community convinced that miracles do happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cleis has spent the last 16 weeks in Brisbane's Princess Alexandria Hospital, undergoing intensive physiotherapy as part of the hospital's rehabilitation program. A few weeks ago, Cleis finally managed to return to Cairns and, although she will still have to spend a few weeks in the Cairns Base Hospi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tal, home is very much in sight. Volunteers are building a two&hyphen;bedroom unit at the back of the family home so Cleis can have 24&hyphen;hour care and, as soon as it is completed, Cleis will finally be able to leave the hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In true Australian spirit, people in the far north have come out to help Cleis in any way they can, through donating money, expertise and time. Jim Sackley, from a local Cairns hardware store, deserves more than a simple recognition. He organised people to volunteer their time to build the two&hyphen;bedroom unit through an appeal on our local radio station, 4CA, and through his connections in the building industry. He lobbied both large and small Cairns businesses to pledge their support. About 40 companies and individuals are now donating their time and everything from furniture for the unit to food for those volunteering their time to building it. Those unselfish and caring actions make us very proud to be Far North Queenslanders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only do the volunteers deserve recognition but testament must also go to Cleis's mother, Rhonda Norbury, who has travelled to Brisbane every weekend for the past 16 or 17 weeks to be with her daughter. The trauma Rhonda has been through is unlike anything that any of us could fathom. Her strength and commitment is an amazing tale of raw emotion and human love. Although 19, Cleis now has the mental age of eight. The senseless bashing has left her without a short-term memory and only a very short attention span.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, this is the second occasion in recent times that a beautiful young life has been almost extinguished through the senseless actions of some mindless moron in my community, the first time being the attempted incineration of schoolboy Tjandamurra O'Shane. One cannot help but ask where we are heading as a society. I feel that we really must stop and ask where we are heading and work together as a community in an effort to prevent this type of evil in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cleis still has a long way to travel to full recovery, but with her fighting spirit, the deep love of her mum and the love and support of the members of my community, she will win and, I have no doubt, go on to achieve her

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to draw the House's attention to the plight of the homeless in Cranbourne in my electorate of Isaacs. The front page of this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cranbourne Independent</EMPHASIS>  newspaper has exposed a worsening situation for the homeless in Cranbourne, as detailed by a range of local community activists. This article says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you're of neat build, cold, homeless and desperate, a St Vincent de Paul clothing bin in the relative quiet of St Agatha's Church car park in Cranbourne is as good as it gets for some kids.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Gerry Fitzgerald, the Vice-President of the local St Vincent de Paul Society, is convinced that this is becoming a regular habit for many because of the lack of emergency accommodation for young people in Cranbourne. Mr Fitzgerald said that he had contacted some six housing workers. One said that she had six youths in recently, yet could not find a bed. Another with an emergency client was told that the nearest available bed was at Brunswick in downtown Melbourne, more than an hour away, and the agency preferred not to place a Cranbourne youth as far away as that. `It's shocking', said Mr Fitzgerald. He said that there should be eight to 10 emergency beds available in every town the size of Cranbourne and, in fact, there are none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In investigating this matter further, the following statistics were provided to me by Hanover in Dandenong, which provides emergency and crisis accommodation and advice to people in our burgeoning and growing south-east corridor of Melbourne, including Cranbourne. They are instructive in understanding the nature and scope of the problem, not only of youth but of all those who find themselves homeless, irrespective of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hanover Dandenong has around 50 new clients seeking their services each week. On average, of this 50, 35 are families and they are predominantly single parent families, the rest being singles. One-third require emergency accommodation because they have been or are just about to be evicted and 45 per cent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are paying more than half their limited income on rent. More than one-third are homeless because of a family or  relationship breakdown or some form of violence occurring in the home. One-third are living in the precarious situation of doubling up, staying with parents or friends on a couch, floor or perhaps a spare bed. They have the added concern of no secure home and no security of tenure. Daily they see clients needing emergency accommodation. Because of the obvious stresses that go with this type of arrangement, this leads to inevitable breakdown. Most of these clients who are doubling up&mdash;their numbers are increasing significantly&mdash;are doing so because they are unable to locate any affordable or vacant property to rent, a consequence of the record low vacancy rate at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> report of 10 April this year showed that many people on the brink of homelessness are being forced to pay up to 80 per cent of their income on rent, leaving little for other living expenses. It is no surprise to learn, therefore, that the proportion of clients who have been evicted has trebled during the last four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hidden consequences of this crisis in housing is borne by the children, with more than one-third of cases having behavioural problems requiring professional treatment and one-half having academic competency scores considered to be within the problem range. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> editorial of 22 April this year showed, perhaps not all those in positions of responsibility are either aware of the depth of the crisis our communities are facing or have shown little sympathy and understanding. Reporting on a visit by the Victorian Premier to a Salvation Army centre, the editorial said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the wake of figures that show that Victoria's homeless have reached a seven year high, the Salvos would hardly have been expecting Mr Kennett to remark that some homeless people preferred to live on the streets.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is not an issue about which I wish to make political points. Rather, I plan over the forthcoming weeks to investigate ways that I can work with local state MPs, who I hope will share my concerns for the homeless in Cranbourne, and the Casey Council to address this immediate and most inhumane problem.</PARA>

It was a very enlightening article written by Max Hawkins and was entitled `Vehicle project is still rolling'. I want to refer to that article because trials will start late this year to determine which of two tenderers wins the Bushranger project contract to provide the Australian Army with 455 infantry mobility vehicles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After providing interim motorisation of the 6th Brigade with modified versions of Perentie, Unimog and Mack vehicles under Bushranger Phase 1, the second phase saw the contest whittled to two short&hyphen;listed bidders by early 1996, after British Aerospace Australia withdrew its Foxhound contender. The two groups remaining in the competition are a consortium led by Australian Defence Industries Ltd, offering the Bushmaster vehicle earlier bid by Perry Engineering South Australia, and a team called Australian Specialised Vehicles Systems, located in Brisbane, bidding the Taipan, which derives from the proven Mamba series of mine-proof vehicles developed in South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bushmaster vehicle was initially bid by Perry Engineering, part of the Boral Johns Perry Group. During the summer of 1996-97, ADI Ltd, after reaching agreement with its main teaming partners, Stewart and Stevenson of the United States and the Timoney Technologies of Ireland, purchased the intellectual property rights to the Bushmaster tender from Boral Ltd. The Bushmaster is specialised vehicle providing high cross&hyphen;country mobility and high&hyphen;speed landmine&hyphen;protected passenger transportation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Ken Harris, ADI managing director, said the vehicle was Australian designed using powertrain systems from the US Army's family of medium tactical vehicles, designed by Stewart and Stevenson, and a suspension designed by Timoney Technologies and manufactured and marketed by Rockwell, which is now Boeing. Australian National Industries, Australia's largest publicly listed engineering company, combined with South African company Reumech to form the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian Specialised Vehicle Systems company on a 51:49 per cent basis to bid the Taipan, which has been fundamentally redesigned to meet Australian conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is going to be a very interesting trial period for these vehicles. Australian Defence Industries launched their bid some years back and are still in there. They have a very strong staff of highly skilled people in the Bendigo heavy engineering division. I look forward to ADI being successful in their bid to provide that Bushranger project contract to the Australian Army to provide those 455 infantry mobility vehicles. I know that the staff at Australian Defence Industries heavy engineering division are looking forward with great anticipation to the trials that will be conducted on that specialised Bushmaster vehicle.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6196"><TITLE>Second Sydney Airport</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I explained to the House the means by which this government has put on the fix to site Sydney's second international airport at Holsworthy. Of the two sites notionally under consideration, Holsworthy and Badgerys Creek, only Holsworthy can accommodate the larger 360,000&hyphen;movement airport being pursued by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). He has distorted the EIS process so that the site acquired at Badgerys Creek prior to 1996 is effectively one-third too small for the type of airport specified in the EIS guidelines. Further land acquisition, bound by the provisions of the Australian constitution, may take another seven years, providing Mr Sharp with the alibi he has been seeking to secure his preferred site at Holsworthy. How else could a government which said nothing about Holsworthy prior to the last election reveal such a radical and dangerous plan for the second airport within weeks of the election result? The fix is on, pure and simple.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against this background it is difficult to understand the obsession of some with Badgerys Creek. I have consistently maintained that the interests of south-west Sydney are best served by fighting Holsworthy first and foremost. Unlike Badgerys Creek, this site is without a substantial buffer from large residential areas. The Howard government was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6197"> elected on a mandate for building Badgerys Creek, not Holsworthy. Perhaps it was yet another non-core promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not content with deceiving the people of Sydney's west and south-west on this issue, the Liberal Party has organised a low&hyphen;level campaign against Badgerys Creek by a number of community organisations. This campaign has been led by Ms Kay Vella, a resident of 2 Gordon Place, Windsor Downs. Why else would someone living 30 kilometres from Badgerys Creek, the same distance as Seven Hills or Liverpool from Mascot, so obsessively campaign against a proposal which clearly will have no impact on her or her nob hill neighbours?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why else would Ms Vella have stood as a candidate at the Lindsay by-election last year and funnelled preferences to the Liberal Party even though the Howard government is committed to increasing the size of the second airport by one-third and possibly turning it into Sydney's main airport? I warn residents in Sydney's west and south-west against Ms Vella's campaign. She clearly represents a front group for the Liberal Party with an agenda shared by the transport minister; that is, to site the airport at Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Vella is being assisted in her campaign by Mr Greg Frawley, a resident in the seat of Macarthur. Mr Frawley has organised an absurd campaign describing Holsworthy as a distraction&mdash;something the government has raised to make Badgerys Creek look better. Some distraction when it directly and dangerously threatens the lifestyle of 500,000 residents in the south-western suburbs of Sydney! By undermining the campaign against Holsworthy, Ms Vella and Mr Frawley are effectively acting hand in glove with Mr Sharp. Their agenda is the same as his; their actions are adding to the alibi the Howard government is seeking to select Holsworthy as the second airport site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's intentions are clear: to say at the end of the EIS process that the Badgerys Creek site is too small for the large airport it wants for Sydney's west and that the public opposition from the likes of Kay Vella and Greg Frawley has divided opinion on the second airport in Sydney's greater west. I fear 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government will use the campaign of these individuals and the groups they purportedly represent against Badgerys Creek as a public justification for the site selection of Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fix is on: shabby business deals prior to the last election about Holsworthy; rigged EIS guidelines prepared last year, with not a word said about the proposition prior to the March 1996 election; and now front groups undermining the campaign to fight Holsworthy first and foremost. Clearly, it will take the election of a Beazley Labor government to stop the Holsworthy plans from proceeding any further.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6197"><TITLE>Christian Brothers: Charters Towers</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="6197" TIME="10.52 p.m." SPEAKER="Katter, Bob, Jnr, MP" NAMEID="HX4" ELECTORATE="Kennedy" PARTY="NP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX4">Mr KATTER</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Kennedy)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.52 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to say a few words this evening, I wish to pay tribute to the Christian Brothers of Australia. We desperately hope they will not leave Charters Towers and they will play the same role they have played for so many years previously at Mount Carmel College, the Christian Brothers school in Charters Towers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Christian Brothers were asked to come to Charters Towers nearly a hundred years ago when Charters Towers was the biggest city in Queensland. By their going there&mdash;my great&hyphen;grandfather played some small role in getting them to go there&mdash;they played a very central role in shaping the thoughts, aspirations and identity of a young, new country. The pupils were Catholic, and this started them in life with a handicap; but never in all of my family's time going through that particular school was any of them told that they were starting life with a handicap. They were taught not to question the system, but to compete within it. If their students started with a slight handicap, this meant simply that they had to try harder, and they were expected to try harder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all of my years, my father's years before me and my great&hyphen;uncles' years before him at the Christian Brothers college, we never heard the slightest hint of criticism of any other Christian faith or any other faith whatsoever. The anti-English attitudes which were present so much in the Australians of Irish descent were never present in the teachings of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6198"> Christian Brothers in Australia. They are an order that are very Australian. Whilst many public schools have traditionally revelled in asserting their Englishness, the Christian Brothers schools were unashamedly and aggressively Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an age of trendyism and political correctness, their simple teachings of traditional Christian values provided a rock upon which students in the tempestuous seas of youth have found some small degree of security. It seems to me more than passing strange that I cannot think of a single student of the Christian Brothers schools, of which I am very familiar in North Queensland, that has been one of our suicide victims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot help but be specific in paying tribute to people I knew over those years. I do so with very great regret. There are so many great men that I knew as Christian Brothers that it seems terribly unfair to single some of them out, but I think it is important that I do. My father brought me up constantly quoting Brother Gettons, who was obviously a towering individual in my father's upbringing. He constantly quoted Napoleon Bonaparte, the great warrior. When Napoleon Bonaparte was asked what was the greatest day of his life, he did not talk about Austerlitz or any of his other great victories. He said, `The greatest day of my life was the day of my first Holy Communion.' We were told about Brother Gettons and probably one of the finest men in all of history, Louis Pasteur. When Louis Pasteur&mdash;probably a quarter of the human race would not be alive today if it were not for Louis Pasteur&mdash;was asked what was his great ambition in life, he said, `My great ambition in life is to achieve the simple faith of an ordinary wife of a fisherman.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Brother Skeehan was most certainly a very formidable figure in my upbringing. I used to be very ashamed to see the headmaster of our school always picking up papers whenever he was walking around the place. I thought that a person in such a very high, prestigious and powerful position should not bend over and pick up papers. But, as I grew older and wiser, I saw the incredible humility of a man who taught all of us never to bend the knee to anyone. If there were a theme that he could 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have given all of the boys that went through those schools in that year, it would have been that wonderful theme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another great educator was Brother Langon. His brother was the editor of one of our big newspapers in northern Australia, the Townsville <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. He constantly reiterated the hard intellectual background for belief in God. That was something that was unashamedly put before all of the kids that went through the schools in those days. I single out yet another brother, Brother Kruger, who was quite the most remarkable rugby league coach in this country, having coached six successive state premierships from a tiny school in Charters Towers. He is one of the secrets behind the success of the Broncos in Brisbane as well. I asked Kelly Egan, one of the more famous footballers in the recent past in Australia, why they were so successful. He said that it was the respect, affection and admiration they had for that particular brother. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6198"><TITLE>Small Business</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the very brief time I have tonight, I wish to acquaint the House with another initiative for the Central Coast to help small business in my region. Yesterday the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, announced the establishment of a small business incubator for the Central Coast&mdash;one of only 10 new business incubators to be established throughout Australia in the next few months. This business incubator will be built at Ourimbah on land provided by the Central Coast Campus of the University of Newcastle. Five hundred thousand dollars has been provided by the government to establish this business incubator on this land provided by the University of Newcastle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business incubators help new businesses survive and grow by providing access to basic infrastructure such as premises, clerical support and mentoring that is so important in the initial phase of new businesses. Speaking from experience, having spent 23 years in small business in varying forms before entering this place, I understand that the initial establishment of small business is one of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6199"> critical stages. Without that establishment, small businesses cannot grow and cannot create employment, real jobs, which is the aim of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding has been made possible for this incubator only by the excellent and cohesive efforts of the Central Coast Regional Development Corporation, the Central Coast Area Consultative Committee and the University of Newcastle all working together to strengthen small business in our region. When we have organisations like this on the Central Coast working together with the government to create businesses and jobs, there is a great future for the Central Coast of New South Wales, and I am pleased to be part of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, I am pleased to support the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), who has sustained a disgraceful attack on him over the last few days. Here we have a minister who is capable, experienced and competent. He understands small business, which is more than I can say for those people on the other side of the House, and he creates jobs. He has come from a disadvantaged background, has become successful and can employ hundreds of Australians. He is somebody that I am proud to support as the minister for small business and he is very competent in that job. He has experience and know&hyphen;how and can get on with the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. Small business is the hope of the central coast economy and is something that I have put a lot of effort into revitalising, along with this government, to create real jobs&mdash;not mickey mouse training schemes like the previous government had, but to create a future for the thousands of young central coast people who are looking to this government for a future.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr Sharp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Port Phillip Region Airport and Airspace Study did not specifically recommend that the airport management advisory committee meet to discuss any changes to the number of aircraft movements at Essendon Airport, but the Study did make the following recommendations with regard to aircraft movements at the airport:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation (14) of the Study states that the "maximum all up weight of aircraft using the airport on an unrestricted basis be limited to 25,000 kg. The number of movements of aircraft with a maximum take&hyphen;off weight exceeding 25,000 kg be determined in consultation with the Essendon Airport Consultative Committee. Operation of aircraft with take&hyphen;off weight in excess of 40,000 kg not be permitted other than in exceptional circumstances."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation (15) of the Study states that "any proposed changes to the above arrangements 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at Essendon Airport be considered by the Essendon Airport Consultative Committee in the first instance, except that in the case of medical or other emergencies dispensation may be given by the Airport Manager for operations on a case by case basis."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has advised the Airport Advisory Committee has not formally met since 1995. When the councils of Essendon and Keilor, which represented the local rate payers on the consultative committees, were amalgamated into the City of Moonee Valley, the Councillors were replaced by appointed Commissioners. The amalgamation of the relevant councils removed the need to consult with multiple local councils in a formal committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Essendon Airport management wrote to the newly appointed Chief Commissioner in February 1995 extending an invitation to himself, fellow commissioners and officers to visit Essendon and continue the line of communication and consultation that was in place with the previous councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of this invitation the Commissioners and officer level staff visited the Airport, which included a presentation and tour, in March 1995. Since that time the FAC advises that it has held a series of meetings with both commissioners and officers of Moonee Valley to discuss Airport related issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, both before and after the amalgamation process the FAC advises that it has continued to consult with representatives of the State Government with regard to activities on the Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Committee has not met on set occasions, the FAC considers that the co&hyphen;operative arrangement established has enabled the discussion of issues. This has allowed the consultative forum between the representatives of the rate payers of both Moonee Valley, State interests and local airport management to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, now that there are elected Councillors, the FAC has agreed to re&hyphen;establish the committee formally, and has invited other nearby local councils to attend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) In 1995 there were 59,373 aircraft movements, while in 1996 there were 64,458 aircraft movements. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6202">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) A "touch and go" is defined as a manoeuvre whereby an aircraft lands and takes off again without coming to a stop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Separate statistics are not kept on the number of "touch and go" operations at Essendon. However Airservices Australia estimates that there are on average about 10 "touch and go's" per week including circuit operations and aircraft transiting Essendon from another airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) No restrictions are placed on "touch and go" operations at Essendon. However training flights that may involve "touch and go" are subject to a number of requirements including:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Airservices Australia has advised that it is not aware of any breaches of the conditions referred to in response to Question 5 above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has advised that Essendon is a controlled aerodrome, and certain requirements have been set out under the Essendon entry in the Enroute Supplement Australia (ERSA) relating to the conduct of "training flights" at that aerodrome. Contravention of those requirements may constitute an offence for which the pilot in command of the aircraft involved may, if convicted, be subject to a fine of up to 50 penalty units ($5000).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of the requirements specified in ERSA specifically refer to "touch and go" operations at Essendon Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under CAR 91, CASA may give directions to the safety of air navigation in respect of a particular aerodrome. Valid direction under CAR 92 could include requirements substantially the same as those set out in the ERSA, relating to "training flight" at Essendon Airport. Any person, including the operator of an aircraft, who contravenes a direction given under CAR 92 may, if convicted of that offence, be subject to a fine of up to 25 penalty units ($2,500). However, it is important to note that nothing in those "conditions" deals explicitly with the conduct of "touch and go" operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, under CAR 100, Air Traffic Control at Essendon Airport could give a specific direction to a particular aircraft relating to the conduct of, among other things, "touch and go" operations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the Honourable Member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The exact volume of fuel that was alleged to have been vented cannot be determined. However, the capacity of the venting system of Boeing 747&hyphen;200 aircraft is approximately 379 litres (ie. 189.5 litres in each wing).</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (f) The alleged incidents are thought to have occurred because of faulty fuel valves that do not seal properly thus allowing fuel to spill from the aircraft when it is steeply banked on take&hyphen;off</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (h) In relation to the first three alleged incidents, Airservices Australia wrote to the operator requesting that the aircraft be inspected and any fault be quickly rectified. My office also took up the matter with Qantas which was the charterer of the aircraft. Qantas has advised that it offered assistance to Evergreen with aircraft troubleshooting and defect rectification and that, following acceptance of this offer by Evergreen, five broken valves in the wing tanks were replaced. In relation to the alleged incident on 14 January 1997, which involved a different Evergreen aircraft ( but still chartered by Qantas ), Airservices again contacted the carrier. Evergreen advised that, after inspecting the aircraft, a float valve flap was replaced and the plane returned to service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department has since written to Evergreen expressing both my own and the wider community's extreme concern about the series of reported fuel venting incidents. In addition, my Department has expressed its concern to the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as the Evergreen aircraft are registered in the United States, and regulatory responsibility for the maintenance oversight of an international aircraft rests with the country in which the aircraft is registered. The FAA has advised it is now undertaking its own investigation and that, if it is found Evergreen failed to comply with any US Federal Aviation Regulations, enforcement action may be initiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department is currently developing regulations that make it an offence to vent fuel in other than an emergency or to operate an aircraft that has faulty mechanical parts that may lead to fuel venting.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) The East Perth redevelopment project is part of the Better Cities Program's East Perth Area Strategy which includes an objective "to promote innovations and increase housing choice, affordability and proximity to employment centres and public transport."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Housing choice in East Perth has increased markedly since the redevelopment commenced. The Commonwealth has worked with the WA Government to establish a mechanism for the provision of fifty (50) affordable housing dwellings in East Perth. The first phase of this commitment has commenced with the East Perth Redevelopment Authority making available two sites in the Haig Park precinct for the development of community housing for low to moderate income households. Submissions from community&hyphen;based agencies were sought in February 1997 and detailed negotiations are currently underway with a proponent to construct a minimum of 14 dwellings. Additional housing will be provided to meet demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes, the Better Cities Program Agreement between the Commonwealth and the State of Western Australia was confirmed by a Deed of Variation between the parties dated 29 April 1997. However, the Better Cities Program ends on 30 June 1997 and Commonwealth involvement will then cease. A separate commitment to provide the 50 affordable housing units at East Perth was confirmed in correspondence from the Western Australian Minister for Planning, the Hon Graham Keirath MLA, to the Parliamentary Secretary for Transport and Regional Development, Hon Michael Ronaldson MP, on 14 April 1997.</PARA>
