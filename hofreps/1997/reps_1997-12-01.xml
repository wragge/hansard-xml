<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the South Pacific and Papua New Guinea. In view of the tightness of time, I will start my comments on this delegation that went to Tuvalu, Kiribati, Vanuatu and PNG by making sure that I record appropriate thanks for the hard work of a number of people associated with the delegation. First of all, I should mention the Parliamentary Relations Office in this building and staff from DFAT who planned and organised the whole thing in advance. I thank the high commissioners and their staff in the countries we visited. It is always invidious to name people, but I would particularly like to thank Anne Plunkett, our Deputy High Commissioner in Fiji. Fiji looks after Tuvalu and Anne Plunkett went there two or three days in advance. Because of aircraft troubles, she had to stay an extra four or five days before she got out of the place. We are very appreciative of the staff in our various posts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank our host countries, particularly the parliaments which hosted us in each of the four countries, for the excellent way that they looked after the delegation. A particular vote of thanks must go to the secretary to the delegation, Grant Harrison, who, on a personal level, found quite unexpectedly whilst we were in the middle of the South Pacific that he was changing jobs. He therefore had some additional challenges to those that are normally associated with that onerous position&mdash;and he did an outstanding job. I would like to thank my other colleagues who were on the delegation for the support they gave throughout the time that we were away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make a brief comment about each of the four countries we visited. Tuvalu is a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> small country covering an area of some 26 square kilometres and with a population of less than 10,000, so it is quite a small island. The highest point is a matter of a few feet. It is a country that is obviously very poor and has incredible economic problems. It survives by sending many hundreds of its young men overseas as seamen on foreign shipping lines. Quite clearly, there is a need for Australian aid, which we already provide, but it will be needed on an ongoing basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kiribati has a population of 77,000, which is smaller in population size than the electorates of any member of this chamber. We were able to visit not only the capital but a number of the outer islands and had a most successful and worthwhile visit there. Vanuatu, quite clearly, is a country with very significant problems. There is a major reform program under way which this country will need to support to get them over a number of their problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to say a few words about PNG, which was the last country we visited. We were there about five weeks ago&mdash;we got back five weeks ago yesterday. We were in the Highlands and saw the beginning of the terrible drought in Papua New Guinea. Quite clearly, it is an appalling situation. It is important to remember when we look at that drought situation that it is not just about getting food into the various areas and the transportation problems in the short term&mdash;although that is very important&mdash;but, given the damage that has been done to the crop base, the soil, the seed and so on, it is a long&hyphen;term problem to be overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have problems with security and, as we have heard in the media, corruption. It is a rich country but with incredible problems and clearly we have a long way to go before we see PNG on its feet. Given our special relationship, we as a country need to continue to make that commitment on an ongoing basis.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this report, I can say the joint parliamentary visit to Tuvalu, Kiribati, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea was most opportune for a number of political and environmental reasons that were well reported 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11592"> prior to our visit. I would like to thank the leader of the delegation, the member for Aston, Peter Nugent, for his firm leadership. I thank other members of the delegation, including the members for Longman (Mr Brough) and Swan (Mr Randall) and the delegate secretary, Grant Harrison, for what proved to be a busy, informative but enjoyable parliamentary visit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit allowed the delegation to appreciate the importance of environmental issues to our Pacific neighbours. We were also able to establish personal contact with a number of political leaders from nations visited. Particularly on Tuvalu and Kiribati, delegates were made aware of the small land mass constituting these two countries. Both nations were in most cases only a few metres above sea level, with very little arable land available to grow crops. For example, Kiribati consists of 33 low&hyphen;lying coral atolls spread over 3.5 million square kilometres. To give members an understanding of the area covered by the 33 atolls, they cover an area equivalent to that of the east to the west coast of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told that some children had to travel by boat for several weeks from some of the outer islands to attend school, and remained at school for the whole year. The delegates were treated to fine dancing and singing performances at several schools we visited in Kiribati. In particular, I would like to congratulate the staff and students of the Immaculate Heart College, North Tarawa, Saint Joseph's College and Whitmee High School on the island of Abaiang.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mention should also be made of the tremendous work being carried out by Australian religious orders and lay people from many other parts of the world in educating children at the abovementioned schools. We saw evidence of Australian aid spent on education and I would say that any further Australian aid for education in this part of the world would be well spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The delegation had the pleasure of meeting with President Tito; Mr Tamuera, the Speaker of the parliament; and members of the Kiribati cabinet. The president and his ministers showed their interest in the Australian delegation and their desire to have close 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ties with Australia at both the political and social level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Vanuatu the delegation visited a hospital on the island of Tanna which was poorly equipped, by our standards, and was in danger of running out of fuel for its generator due to a shipping dispute. I was very pleased to hear from a Canadian doctor in charge of this hospital that a solar hot water system had been installed by Australian volunteers from the Rotary Club at Oberon in New South Wales and that a similar project was being planned by the Rotary Club of Mooloolaba in Queensland. This was a fine example of a community in Australia assisting one of our Pacific nations. While in Vanuatu the delegation was briefed on a comprehensive reform program which is designed to improve the standard of government, the economy and service to the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Papua New Guinea there was a general agreement amongst politicians and public servants we met that law and order issues were having a major impact on the economy. While there are many fine tourist attractions throughout Papua New Guinea, including the national museum and botanical gardens in Port Moresby, tourists would be reluctant to visit this place until law and order issues were resolved. Australian aid is being well spent on training the police force and in providing infrastructure facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most interesting part of our short stay in Papua New Guinea was our visit to Mount Hagen and the Highlands. Here we saw the effects of the drought in the Simbu province. In this province, only three per cent of the population are engaged in either private or government organisations. The rest of the population, numbering over 250,000, depend on subsistence agriculture. The province normally has daily rainfall and is usually covered with tropical rainforest and grasslands. However, drought and frost have reduced this region to a dust bowl. What appeared obvious was that very little attempt was made to preserve water on a family by family basis.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs I present the committee's report on a visit to New Zealand&mdash;16&hyphen;19 June 1997&mdash;entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Development in New Zealand agriculture</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JT4">Mrs BAILEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This visit not only provided members with the opportunity to investigate issues relevant to our current inquiry into trade reform but, having recently completed an inquiry into the management of Australian fisheries, we were also keen to assess the reform of New Zealand's fisheries management. Chapter 3 of this report details our assessment and provides a further recommendation to be considered with recommendation 37 in our report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The last frontier</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee spent 3&half; full days of consultation with the New Zealand ministries of economic research, forestry, agriculture and fisheries; the Agricultural Industry Training Organisation; the Maori Land Court; the Business Round Table; the Apple and Pear Marketing Board; the Dairy Board; the Fruitgrowers Federation; the Meat Industry Association and Producer Board; the Kiwifruit Marketing Board; the Poultry Industry Association; the Federation of Farmers Association; and Mount Albert Horticultural Research Centre. We also met with relevant ministers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the Speaker of the New Zealand parliament, and joined in discussions with the New Zealand Select Committee on Primary Production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as examining the innovative ways in which New Zealand has managed to be so export focused and has developed niche markets, the committee was particularly interested to investigate the amount of information available at all levels of the production, marketing and distribution chain, how this information was disseminated and its value. Quarantine and bio&hyphen;security were issues of importance to the committee, given our trade inquiry and that our visit coincided with the fireblight controversy. Forthright discussions were held on the question of appropriate protocols for the collection and removal of samples of allegedly diseased material and on New Zealand's application to export apples from anywhere in New Zealand to Australia. Depending on the confirmation of the presence of fireblight in Australia, the stated intention by New Zealand is to pursue the ban by Australia on New Zealand apples in the arbitration tribunal of the WTO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In line with its strong push for exports, New Zealand is pressing Australia to hasten its time frame for risk analysis of New Zealand uncooked salmon meat into Australia. Given that New Zealand has accepted uncooked salmon from Canada, the USA and China, the committee reiterated that Australian authorities are rightly wary. However, these examples demonstrate New Zealand's tenacity and fiercely competitive focus on export markets, regardless of the goodwill that exists between our two countries, illustrated with CER. Two particular areas of New Zealand reform and innovation that impressed us were the reform of producer boards and the development of a bio&hyphen;security council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of the producer board reform is to make these boards more accountable to industry and more flexible in their commercial operations. Boards will focus on promotion, market development and research rather than on statutory requirements. Given that bio&hyphen;security is an integral part of global trade, the New Zealand Bio&hyphen;Security Council is under the control of the Minister for Agriculture and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11594"> International Trade and includes independent scientific expertise as well as the resources of government agencies coordinating the best people for risk assessment and research available and able to cooperate across agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New Zealand vigorously pursues export markets and continues the reform program it began in the late 1980s with the withdrawal of industry subsidies. It maintains an aggressive marketing strategy, with strong emphasis on brand development, and is well placed to take advantage of market changes as trade liberalisation continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, each of our countries is a small player in global terms and it would be to our mutual benefit for both countries to cooperate in overcoming problems like market access. I thank you, Mr Speaker, for making this visit possible. I would also like to place on record our appreciation to our New Zealand hosts for organising such a detailed visit for us. Such a detailed visit led to the very successful visit that we had, including the wide&hyphen;ranging topics that we raised. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that I now have a little more time than I had originally thought, I would like to make mention of a couple of important areas that committee members found of great interest. One in particular was the industry training developments that are taking place in New Zealand. New Zealand has established a range of industry training organisations to increase the work force skills and both on&hyphen; and off&hyphen;job training. This is particularly so in that it provides a number of opportunities for young people to learn on a first&hyphen;hand basis as well as get the theoretical training. It adds to the skill of their work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the illustrations to us was the development of the model farm example where many young people are able to spend time on farms. This is of course in line with the training that they receive at institutions like TAFE, and young people are given credit for this. Another example is the demand that New Zealand places on brand development, the vigorous way they pursue their forays into international markets and their development of niche markets. Everyone would be ex 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tremely familiar with the term `kiwi fruit'. It may be of interest to members to know that Italy produces more kiwi fruit than New Zealand, but if you were to travel around Italy and ask Italians where kiwi fruit is from they will always offer that it is from New Zealand. In line with pushing this brand and developing further market strategies, the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board is quite a separate organisation from a recently launched board known as Zespri International, which markets kiwi fruit under the distinctive brand of Zespri.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Zespri International maintains a completely separate role from the Kiwifruit Marketing Board, which is a statutory industry management authority and is responsible for the regulatory functions. Zespri International has launched a separate marketing strategy which allows it to operate at arms length from the growers and gives it much more flexibility. This is in line with the major area of reform which the New Zealand government has undertaken, and that is the reform of most of its producer boards, which is giving it flexibility to be much more accountable to industry and to act in a much more commercial way. Zespri International is a prime example of that, and we were privileged to see much of the new advertising material that they have recently launched.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of great interest to the committee was the way some of the other industry bodies operate. The New Zealand Dairy Board has some excellent runs on the board, once again establishing a very firm brand name, and has established itself as a force to be reckoned with. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of Auditor&hyphen;General's audit report No. 33&mdash;1996&hyphen;97&mdash;The administration of the Family Court of Australia</EMPHASIS> , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HK5">Mr ANDREWS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The audit report was conducted in order to `assess the economy, efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of the court's administrative functions'. The committee was well aware of the fact that the Family Court has been under almost constant review since it commenced work in 1976. There is a delicate balance between the positive and negative effects of scrutiny. There comes a time when improvements to efficiency, which often result from review, may be offset by the burden on the resources of an institution, caused by the need to meet a reviewer's requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee considers that the court should be permitted a period of consolidation before being subject to further major reviews, though we do not consider that scrutiny such as that conducted by parliamentary estimates committees should be delayed. Because of the number of reviews of the Family Court, coupled with the desire to avoid the waste of public resources by duplicating the work invested by these other reviewers, the committee chose to conduct a limited review of the report by the Australian National Audit Office. Our report considers the conduct and scope of the audit and focuses on some of the major issues confronting the administration of the court as it approaches the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The court reduced the number of administrative regions from three to two following the recommendations of the Coaldrake report in 1996. The ANAO considers that regional management makes little contribution from an organisational viewpoint to the operation of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the court and recommends that it be abolished. The court disagreed with this finding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter was addressed by a further report to the court by Professor Coaldrake this year. As a result of this report, the court has decided to abolish the regional structure and replace it with an area structure with two headquarters&mdash;one in Sydney and one in Melbourne. Professor Coaldrake recommended that the court either commit itself to the regional structure and make it more efficient or, alternatively, explore a structure based on areas but different administratively to the regional structure. The committee notes that the court found Professor Coaldrake's assessment of the top structure requirements of the court particularly helpful. The court has now prepared a timetable for implementing the various aspects of the Coaldrake report; hence, the result desired by the ANAO will be achieved but by another route.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also addresses the matter of the location of primary dispute resolution services, including counselling. The Attorney&hyphen;General's Department issued a discussion paper on this issue in August. The committee hopes its comments will be useful to the department as it contemplates the delivery of these important services. The court's focus on encouraging separating couples to avoid litigation makes counselling, conciliation and mediation integral aspects of the court's administration. The committee recognises that clients should have a choice between using court provided services and assessing the same sort of services in the wider community, provided the community based services are of the same professional standard as those delivered by the court. Protection from the risk of domestic violence should also be of the same high quality and standard. The committee did not take extensive evidence in the context of our review of the audit report, so we do not make recommendations on the delivery of primary dispute resolution services at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we urge caution on those who are seeking to change the status quo. The committee considers that there is a prima facie case for these primary dispute resolution services to continue to be provided by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11596"> court. The onus should be on those who consider they can design a better model to demonstrate how this could be achieved. The committee will have further comments to make on this subject in its forthcoming report on aspects of family services. That report will not be presented until next year, which is why I am making a brief comment on this matter now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the committee notes that the audit report finds that, in general, the Family Court is well focused on moving towards best practice. While it is meeting its performance targets only in some areas, it still compares well with the Family Court of Western Australia and other Australian superior courts. I thank the secretariat for their work and, in particular, the secretary, Mrs Judy Middlebrook. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JK6">Mr McCLELLAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She will be a real loss, and I thank the member for his comment. As the chairman indicated, the Family Court has been under virtually constant review since its inception in 1976. We are of the view that there comes a time when there is no point in doing further reviews; it is time for people to get their hands dirty and sort out the way forward, as a result of those reviews. In particular, in terms of the Auditor-General's report, it would be regrettable indeed if the report were regarded as an edict from on high and there were not that ongoing continuous cooperation between officers of the Family Court and the Auditor-General's office in terms of working through the various recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we note, yes, while there were things for improvement, on the whole the court structure is operating efficiently. I should say that there is always a delicate balance in the parliament reviewing the administration of a court struc 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ture, given the separation of powers. However, at no stage have the Family Court sought to rely on that separation and say that they are not open to review in terms of at least their administrative processes&mdash;and we say that is entirely appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But one comment that I should make is the recommendation of the committee&mdash;I would summarise it as `tread with caution'&mdash;in terms of any contemplation of outsourcing of the primary dispute resolution services. They include not only counselling but also conciliation and mediation. While I think it is fair to say that counselling could be provided by outside non-government agencies, when we come to the intensity of conciliation and mediation in very emotional dispute circumstances that we have all witnessed in our electoral offices, there is significant doubt, in my view, that the non-government agencies could cope with that in the context of trying to achieve an outcome of resolution of the legal process without resorting to litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is naive to suggest that the NGOs could in those circumstances have the knowledge of the court process or the knowledge of judicial precedent sufficient to guide the parties. Indeed, the risk is that, if they do not have that knowledge, they will misguide the parties in terms of what they have to contemplate in resolving the litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fear that outsourcing could be more a part of a philosophical commitment towards contracting out government services rather than really looking at just what is achieved through the mediation processes of the Family Court. Certainly, if you look at the number of cases settled, if that did not occur, the court would be in real trouble&mdash;indeed, the government's coffers would be in real trouble because of the greater commitment of resources to a litigation outcome than to a mediated outcome. That leaves aside the social consequences of people who have an ongoing relationship in very many circumstances because of their mutual obligation to children not having worked out their arrangement voluntarily and having it determined by a judge.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11597">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, we recommend that the government exercise extreme caution in this contemplation of outsourcing, because it could be the ultimate of `penny wise and pound foolish'. But there will be more said on that in the coming year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia&hyphen;Indonesia maritime delimitation treaty&mdash;12th report</EMPHASIS> , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OJ4">Mr TAYLOR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the important report I table today deals with the Australia&hyphen;Indonesia Maritime Delimitation Treaty. It is ground breaking because it further establishes the seabed and water column boundaries between the two countries after two decades of deliberation. Because of this, I believe further debate is appropriate in the Main Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The treaty represents a very satisfactory outcome for Australia. Accordingly, we have recommended ratification, as well as commenting on a number of other important matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The treaty establishes separate water column and seabed boundaries that result in areas of overlapping jurisdiction. Based on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> historical precedent, any solution to the maritime boundaries between the two countries was going to involve separate boundaries. This represents a fair and equitable outcome. However, it will require a degree of mutual cooperation and careful management. We have recommended that the government identify and advertise widely the points of contact in various government departments which will have responsibility for coordinating dispute resolution in the overlapping areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we heard evidence on Christmas Island that the local community sought an equidistant boundary with Indonesia, we believe that, had that particular boundary gone to international arbitration, then the negotiated outcome would have been the best Australia could have expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also heard evidence from East Timor support groups disputing Australia's right to enter into a treaty with Indonesia which would impact on the people of East Timor. We accepted, however, that this and previous governments have recognised Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of Indonesian traditional fisher access to the area prescribed by the 1974 MOU was also raised as a matter requiring clarification. We agree that, while moving the boundary a further 12 nautical miles to the north of the Ashmore Islands represents a significant gain for Australia, it nevertheless creates an anomaly with the current MOU boundary which impacts on the issue of boundary enforcement. In light of this change, we have recommended further review of the MOU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are convinced that this treaty will create certainty regarding the matter of resource exploration and exploitation, particularly in relation to potential oil and gas fields. In relation to shared resources, such as fish stocks, we have recommended that the government review existing agreements with Indonesia to ensure that suitable management controls are in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During our public hearing on Christmas Island, a number of important environmental and immigration issues were raised with us by the local community. We have recommended 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11598"> that the government establish cooperative marine scientific research provisions with Indonesia, particularly in relation to the Abbott's booby, and that it review the issues of illegal immigration and marine pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of consultation was again a matter of concern and committee debate. Of fundamental concern was the fact that at no stage in the process was the community of Christmas Island appropriately consulted. We believe that, at the very least, this remote island community should have been given the opportunity to put forward its views in preparing the national interest analysis. We have recommended that departmental officials go to Christmas Island and conduct a thorough briefing with officials and the local community before the treaty is ratified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, we heard conflicting statements from Western Australian and Northern Territory departments over the level and adequacy of consultation throughout the process. It has not been possible, however, to ascertain definitively whether this was a breakdown of the Commonwealth, state and territory consultative process or a breakdown in consultation between the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This inquiry was an interesting and challenging task, dealing with a relationship of fundamental importance to Australia. The treaty serves as a model of bilateral cooperation in the region. This would not have been possible without the productive dialogue between our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and Indonesian Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas. I commend the report to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any treaty with Indonesia has to tread a very dangerous tightrope in regard to attitudes within this parliament. I commend the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties as a reasonable compromise in the circumstances. It is vital that the report incorporated in 7.36 a statement that this treaty:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . does not mean, however, that we endorse the manner in which East Timor was incorporated into Indonesia, nor that reported continuing human 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rights violations being perpetrated against the East Timorese people should be ignored.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Furthermore, in 7.37 the report says of the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We acknowledge the force of submissions by East Timorese groups that they did not have an opportunity to participate in the process. We thank these groups for their involvement in this Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the chair of the committee indicated, there is a degree of disquiet within the committee about the consultation process that occurred in coming to today's tabling. The committee commented that `the consultation process in relation to Christmas Island was inadequate and re-emphasises the importance of involving all Australians, no matter how remote, in the consultation process'. Indeed, committee members, a number of whom are present today, went to Christmas Island, Darwin and Perth in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was very concerned that 2,000 Australians&mdash;whether it be because of a breakdown in communications or because of confusion as to who was representing them or whatever&mdash;did not get a proper look in in this process. That is crucial not only because they are remote and they are Australians but also because there were some very vital issues related to their particular vicinity. For example, the issue of pollution was raised. In 1996, 490-odd people seeking refugee status in this country chose to go through Christmas Island. As the chair alluded, there is the question of the Abbott's booby, a large sea bird of which there is limited knowledge of its terrestrial biology and, therefore, limited knowledge of very crucial aspects of its long-term preservation. The committee has put on the record the hope that in future the department will make sure that in the NIA or at the beginning of the process in which we will be involved we get a list of those who were consulted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also stated that there should be a review of the 1974 traditional fisher memorandum of understanding with Indonesia in light of the changes to the exclusive economic zone boundary. I understand that takes up 4.7, where the Fisheries Department of Western Australia indicated some grave concerns about: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11599">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the continuance of unconstrained fishing activity by Indonesian fishers. The department would allow little opportunity for effective management to take place.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, the committee has taken on board those aspects. As I have said, we come to this report on the agreement with Indonesia saying that there is no way that we condone the colonial presence there. This is a matter of some dispute and some difference in the parliament. Australian governments of all varieties have accepted the de jure recognition of that occupation. However, this committee has brought down a reasonable compromise, saying that the fact that we have come to this agreement with Indonesia is in no way related to our assessment of human rights abuses in Timor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, I present the committee's summary report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Men's health</EMPHASIS> , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NV5">Mr FORREST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report I have just tabled deals with an area of health care which has only recently received prominence. Until the last few years, it has been assumed that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> men's health has been addressed adequately through the provision of general health services to the community. Moreover, the identification of men's health as a special need was seen as irrelevant in many health and academic circles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it has become evident that the health system may not be providing the best care or appropriate services for many men who are reluctant to utilise existing services and facilities unless it is absolutely essential. This makes preventive approaches to men's health very difficult to design or implement. The member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) would be very interested in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs decided to provide a greater focus on the particular health status of men in the Australian community and undertook to conduct a seminar at Parliament House to encourage debate and to promote the necessity for direct action at the national level. The men's health seminar was convened in September this year, in order to gather information from a range of academics, general practitioners, health workers and other experts to give committee members a broader appreciation of the complex issues involved. The seminar also provided an opportunity for peak health, community and men's support organisations to exchange information and contribute to the discussion of key issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mortality statistics provide a stark illustration of the disturbing state of men's health. Males experience higher mortality rates at all ages compared with females, rising to a peak of 2.65 male deaths for every female death in the 15 to 24 age group. Men also have higher mortality rates for all major causes of death. For example, working age men between 24 and 64 years of age have death rates 3.53 times higher for cardiovascular disease, 1.94 times higher for cancers and 3.28 times higher for injury than that for working age women. Male adult suicide is also noticeably higher than it is for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major outcomes of the seminar's proceedings provided a clear description of men's poor health status, which extends beyond standard health measures to broader 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11600"> aspects of men's wellbeing and quality of life; an identification of the neglect of the health system to systematically identify and address the impact that `maleness' has on a range of important men's health issues; and a range of constructive strategies to support and strengthen the existing responses to these problems at the community, regional, state and national levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Committee members considered that the information provided at the seminar should be disseminated as widely as possible and, for this reason, resolved to produce a summary report, tabled today, which would further focus discussion. The report also contains a series of recommendations designed to improve the current delivery of services and provide a national structure to refine education prevention programs and treatment and support services. I hope that all members of the House will read the committee's report, and I urge the government to act on its recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank Mr Michael Tynan, who provided the secretariat with valuable expertise and support in the design and organisation of this very worthwhile seminar, as well as the hardworking secretariat. I give particular thanks to Mr Richard Fletcher, who facilitated the day's activities during the seminar. I commend the report to the House. To all my male colleagues around the place: this report calls on them to pay particular attention to their health needs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The men's health seminar, held by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, has provided a valuable insight into the state of men's health in this country. The statistics speak for themselves. The previous speaker and chair of the committee, the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) has mentioned some of them, but I am going to repeat them because it will illustrate the effect these statistics had on the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Males experience higher mortality rates at all ages compared with females. There are 2.65 male deaths for every female death in the 15 to 24 age group. Men also have higher mortality rates for all the major causes of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> death. Working age men aged 25 to 64 have death rates 3.53 times higher for cardiovascular disease, 1.94 times higher for cancers and 3.28 times for injury than those of working age women. Information explaining the statistics in more detail are outlined in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While some research work looking at many aspects of men's health has been done, it is worth noting that in the Department of Health and Family Services's summary of all the general practice divisional projects between 1993 and 1996 only one page out of 125 pages, with each page summarising about 12 projects, deals specifically with men's health. That outlines very clearly the problem that we are looking at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major outcomes of the seminar included a clear description of men's poor health status, which extends beyond standard health measures to broader aspects of men's health, and a range of constructive strategies to support and strengthen the existing responses to the problems highlighted at the community, regional, state and national levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some basic questions and some broader questions which became very evident to me, as a female member of the seminar, when I sat as a member of that committee. Why is it, I asked, that men go to their GP far less frequently than women? It cannot be because they are always well, because the statistics show us that they are dying younger. Why do they not use community health centres more frequently? Why do they allow symptoms to persist longer when so many diseases they are suffering from are treatable? These are the questions we need to address, and these are the questions that this seminar has highlighted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thoroughly recommend this report to all members, both male and female, in this House. I commend the recommendations contained in the summary report. It is extremely important that the work that goes into a report like this from this committee be measured in value by its exposure to the community. I hope that we as a committee are able to make as many copies of this report available as possible to a broad ranging area of health practitioners within the community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11601">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to place on record my thanks and the thanks of my colleagues to all those people who participated so openly and so constructively in this very important area of inquiry. Men's health is an obvious area of concern which we simply must address. I also acknowledge the valuable work and assistance of all the committee secretariat, including Bjarne Nordin, Michael Tynan, Bronwen Jaggers and Belinda Shepherd. This was a report and a seminar I was very pleased to participate in. I highly recommend the report to all members of the House.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> notes that Australians who have sustained an injury or been involved in an accident which may be the subject of a claim for compensation are unable to claim benefits from private health insurers to assist with the payment of medical and other costs incurred as a result of the accident or injury;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is concerned at the extreme hardship this creates for many Australians and Australian families, often extending over many years; and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> calls on the Government to present to the House, as a matter of urgency, a bill which will:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> require private health insurers to pay provisional benefits to claimants in respect of services which are the subject of compensation claims; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provide for private health insurers to be reimbursed for these payments from the compensation paid when this occurs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have a wonderfully universal health system in this country which ensures that all Australians, regardless of their means, have access to decent medical treatment when needed. But Medicare cannot survive without the existence of a strong private health insurance industry. In recent years, as all members know, we have seen a dramatic decline in the number of people participating in that private health insurance industry. Currently about 31 per cent of us have private health insurance compared with about 50 per cent just back in 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has to be said that neither side of politics has done a very good job of slowing down that decline or enhancing the number of people who are covered by private health insurance. There are a number of reasons why the numbers have declined over that period, but the issue I raise with the House today is probably not one of them. Most privately insured Australians are not aware that the fine print in their contractual arrangement with the insurer does not cover them in all circumstances. As they grow more aware&mdash;I intend to be out there ensuring that that awareness grows&mdash;more and more people will drop out of private health insurance and the strain on the industry will become greater and greater. This is an issue which must be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, most of our privately insured believe that, if they are in an accident, they are covered for medical insurance&mdash;that is, if they are not covered by Medicare or some other compensation, they have their private health insurance to fall back on. But they are very wrong, as was one of my constituents, Mr Bill Vercoe. Mr Vercoe was a self-employed painter. He had top cover with NIB, something that cost him around $2,000 every year. In March 1994 Mr Vercoe was involved 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11602"> in a car accident. He was not the driver at fault.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Understandably, as the driver of the other car was registered and therefore had third party personal insurance, because Mr Vercoe had top cover through NIB, he believed that medical insurance would be the least of his concerns. He was badly injured. He believed that all that money he had invested in private health insurance had been worth while on the day of his accident. But, to his shock and horror, he later learned that NIB will not pay any amount to cover his medical expenses whenever the accident is or may be subject to a compensation claim. `Read our book,' NIB told him soon after the accident. As an aside, Mr Vercoe also had cover for his self&hyphen;employment in case he was sick or hurt and unable to work. It took him a long time and a long battle with that private insurer before they were prepared to cover his loss of wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compensation claims are not settled overnight, especially in Mr Vercoe's case. In this case CIC were the insurer. They challenged the extent to which the accident contributed to the injuries in question. It can take years for a settlement, and in Mr Vercoe's case it did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">NIB, National Mutual Health Insurance, HCF, MBF and Medicare Private&mdash;between them they cover around 70 per cent of all those who are privately insured&mdash;have within their rule books clauses which specifically remove their liability in circumstances where the sickness or injury is or could be subject to a compensation claim. Some of them, despite this clause, will make a provisional payment on the basis that the insured enters into a deed to repay the amount out of their compensation settlement when it is eventually received. Any such decision remains totally a matter for the discretion of the fund. But, in NIB's case, no such service was offered at all. NIB disgracefully left Mr Vercoe to sink or swim. If it was not for the fact that Mr Vercoe had worked hard for many years and taken a responsible attitude to savings, he would have sunk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same would have occurred with Mr and Mrs Col McKew of Edgeworth in the electorate of the honourable member for Charlton 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (Mr Robert Brown). Col's 18-year-old son, Anthony, was severely injured in a car accident in February. They almost lost their son; indeed, it is a miracle he is still alive. Who was the private health insurer, Mr Deputy Speaker? You guessed it&mdash;NIB. Because there was an element of contributory negligence in this case, Anthony's compensation case will no doubt drag on for years. In the meantime, his parents have been lucky enough to have good friends willing to lend them the money to cover medical expenses in between the date of his injury and the date when the compensation case may be settled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like Bill Vercoe, the McKews thought they would be okay in the event of such a crisis. They contributed to their fund in good faith, not aware how important it was to read the fine print. To his credit, Mr Vercoe has not taken the matter lying down. He has waged a public relations exercise against NIB, he has taken out newspaper ads discouraging people from joining the fund and encouraging them to leave, he has distributed pamphlets on the streets of Newcastle and he has had NIB threaten to sue him. But Mr Vercoe fights on fearlessly because he knows right is on his side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Vercoe has had his house broken into on three occasions since he began to wage this war with NIB. When I first heard he made the charge that NIB had been somehow involved, I took it lightly as well&mdash;as I am sure most honourable members will&mdash;but as time has gone on I have begun to wonder. On each occasion his house was broken into nothing was touched other than the reams of paperwork Mr Vercoe has accumulated on his research into this very important matter which has had such a devastating impact upon him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I originally took up this matter, it was my intention to introduce a private member's bill seeking to amend the Health Insurance Act 1974 and the National Health Act 1954 so far as was necessary to force the funds to make provisional payments in the case of compensation matters. However, I soon learned that the drafting of the legislation was so complex that it would need to be a matter for the government. So I have chosen to use a private member's motion to highlight 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11603"> the problem in the hope that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) will take up the cause and introduce a bill to fix the problem, and I implore him to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there is no doubt that the health funds will  resist this with some vigour and will not be prepared to be banker for those who are injured, we now have some pretty hefty support on our side. Let me say that I do not care if the legislation has within it a provision that interest be charged. I know Mr Vercoe would have been in a much better position if NIB had covered his costs between the time of the accident and the settlement of his compensation claim and charged him interest on that bank amount. He would have been much better off than he was under the current arrangements, as would have been Mr and Mrs Colin McKew.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But now, as I said, we have some hefty support on our side. In her 1997 annual report, the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner, Ms Mary Perrett, has given her support to the proposal. On page 38 she reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Health funds should be required to pay benefits for treatment covered by damages and compensation rights, as long as the members concerned enter enforceable undertakings with the health funds to take responsible steps to pay back the money eventually.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When I was contemplating submitting a private member's bill on the matter, I did what I thought was a responsible thing and wrote to all the major funds seeking comment from them. I got not one reply. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of compensation for people under public liability or workers compensation is an enormously complex area, and often it does not just involve one fund or one claimant. For example, in the case that the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) mentioned&mdash;the case of Ms White&mdash;in the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner report, one of the problems that emerged from that case was that there were three different entities that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were publicly liable. It is an extremely complex area where a number of parties can be involved and not just the claimant. So, in any private member's bill or any piece of legislation, it would be difficult to put together legislation which would not be unfair and which would actually protect the health funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hunter mentioned that one of the problems with private health has been the declining levels of private health insurance. That is a problem which has concerned this government. The Productivity Commission inquiry report, which came out earlier this year, dealt with some of the problems for the decline in private health insurance. Despite the speech we have had this afternoon, I scanned through the Productivity Commission's report on private health insurance and it did not mention the issue of compensation once. I could not find it anywhere. I know the member for Hunter made a submission to the Productivity Commission on that subject. But, in actual fact, they documented that a spiral had occurred&mdash;a cycle. In that cycle, as premiums rose and payouts increased, you had adverse selection where the elderly and people who were more likely to make claims stayed in the funds while the young and fit and healthy pulled out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also said that there were almost two different periods in the Hawke-Keating government where, during the 1980s, several decisions were taken by the Hawke government in the period 1986 to 1988 which directly led to an increase in premiums. Those government decisions, the Productivity Commission estimated, were responsible for about 30 per cent of the increases in private health insurance premiums. Access Economics has estimated that those decisions increased the cost of premiums by 39 per cent. This was caused by things like removing the Commonwealth bed day subsidy, changing the Medicare rebate from 85 per cent to 75 per cent for inpatient stays, the 1993 Medicare agreements which encouraged public hospitals to increase their throughput of public hospitals and removing the Commonwealth contribution to the private reinsurance pool. All of those things led to an explosion in premiums in the period 1986 to 1988 of over 40 per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11604">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More recently in the 1990s, as they documented, the major factor which has seen a rise in the premiums of private health insurance has been the increasing use of private patients of private hospitals. That is responsible for something like 30 per cent of the increase in premiums. Many people know, anecdotally, that private hospitals now offer a much greater range of services than they used to, and private patients are able to be seen in private hospitals. But that is a lot more expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to the private member's motion, it is important to realise that one of the problems this motion could create is the problem of double dipping. In the area of Medicare benefits and nursing home benefits, it was noticed by the previous government that double dipping was a particular problem whereby people would be paid Medicare or nursing home benefits but had actually received compensation and not reimbursed the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), when a parliamentary secretary and speaking on the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Bill 1994, referred to double dipping and a review of the relationship between compensation and health and community service programs which found that many people receiving compensation designed to meet the full cost of injury related, medical and other care needs do not reimburse the Commonwealth. They double&hyphen;dip by receiving free or heavily subsidised services funded by the Commonwealth as well as compensation for the full cost of those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hunter also mentioned the complaints commissioner. Regarding the specific recommendations of the complaints commission, the commissioner suggested, as the honourable member mentioned, that health funds should be required to pay benefits for the treatment covered by damages and compensation rights as long as the members concerned enter enforceable undertakings with the health funds to take reasonable steps to pay back the money eventually. Repayment would occur if and when the claims for damages or compensation were finalised successfully. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a letter to Ms Perrett, Russell Schneider, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Health Insurance Association, responded that the comments about compensation need to be seen in the light of a longstanding industry dispute involving compensation insurers, Medicare and the legal profession in relation to sweetheart compensation deals. Sweetheart deals have been a longstanding problem in the area of compensation. In sweetheart deals lawyers agree not to pursue medical damages if the fund has already paid. That puts the claimant at a disadvantage when they find that neither Medicare nor the fund wish to pay for the liability for which another insurer, the compensation insurer, has charged a premium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Effectively, this motion is asking private health funds to act as a bank in cases where, for example, a work cover insurer has already accepted a premium on the guarantee that they will pay out in the case of a workers compensation liability or a public liability insurer has received a premium on the guarantee that they will pay out in the case of a public compensation liability, and pay for something that the public liability insurers or the work cover insurers have already accepted a premium for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a lot of sympathy for the constituents mentioned by the member for Hunter and the constituent from the electorate of the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), but it needs to be remembered that these cases are not typical. Most compensation cases are resolved quickly. In actual fact, if there are any out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses, more often that rests with the hospital or the doctor concerned in that the bills are often made directly to work cover or to the insurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue that this motion raises is whether we can do it. Under the National Health Act we have very wide powers to legislate for private health insurance, but the issue of compensable schemes and compensation has always been recognised as a matter for the states and it is generally a state government responsibility. Things like workers compensation and so on are administered through public hospitals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11605">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One problem I have with the motion is that forcing the funds to pay for a compensable injury could be another factor leading to further premium rises. I know that the member for Hunter outlined in a previous speech on the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill his concerns about private health insurance premiums rising. We are looking at trying to constrain the amount by which premiums rise. Any premium rise has to be approved by a committee consisting of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the health minister. Health funds have been told they cannot raise premiums just to go onto their bottom line. They have to be for the specific purpose of topping up their reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regarding some of the cases we have heard about, including that outlined in the complaints commission report, court hearings can be extremely protracted in this area. That is where there is a problem. As the member for Hunter recognised, the funds do have the discretion to make a payout if they wish in those circumstances. If people are concerned that this may be a problem, they should, as with most things, shop around. Most of the funds do not offer insurance payments&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One wonders whether the honourable member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) was giving a speech on behalf of constituents within his electorate or on behalf of the health insurance funds. There is an unquestioned delay in these matters coming to court. Whether it is a car accident or a workers compensation case, as the member for Boothby said in his opening remarks, cases can often be complex. They can often be complex because of dispute about liability&mdash;there may have been a previous injury or other insurers involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notoriously, compensation cases take at least 12 months but usually 14 months, and a District Court or Supreme Court case up to two years or even longer. To say that the worker and his family have to suffer the injustice of being without treatment for that period is harsh in the extreme. Not only is it harsh in the extreme; it is bad economics because all the research indicates if workers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are given treatment quickly they are more likely to recover and rehabilitate themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian parliament has a legitimate interest in ensuring that workers are assisted in their medical treatment and get back to not only a healthy family environment but also being productive members of the community as soon as possible. The member for Boothby may doubt that the Australian parliament has the power, but the health insurance funds are on notice that, if they cannot get together on a code, the Australian parliament will do something about it&mdash;if not under this government, certainly in 12 months time when, as the opinion polls suggest, the government changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Workers have a real and legitimate interest in receiving appropriate medical care. Often, if a worker has not undergone surgery to repair the damage, his case cannot be resolved because the very nature of a damages action is that once-and-for&hyphen;all compensation is being given to that worker for the past and for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member spent a considerable amount of his time talking about the health insurance rebate. I thought he was going to take that angle. The fact of the matter is that $1.7 billion is being spent by this government to induce people to enter private health funds. That is about $50,000 per new member. It has been a dramatic failure. At the same time, $800 million has been taken out of the public health system&mdash;again delaying the amount of time an injured person has before they can get appropriate treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a theoretical risk of double dipping, but already the Health Insurance Commission is able to place a charge on any compensation outcome. That charge remains until the lawyer, or whoever the person is, clarifies the terms of the settlement and ensures that the charge is paid back to the Health Insurance Commission. It would be a very simple thing for the private health funds to do. The honourable member also mentioned the possibility of sweetheart deals where medical expenses were quarantined out of the terms of settlement. Again, it is relatively easy to deem part of a settlement as representing the medical expenses determined 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11606"> on the basis of the expenses actually charged. So that is a false and simplistic fear, manufactured by the health insurance funds. When you offset that fear against the devastation caused to workers and their families it does not measure at all on the scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member is saying that the private health funds act as a bank, effectively, to loan money to the workers. If that is right, so be it. But they are doing much more than that because if the worker or injured person had decided not to pursue the claim they would be obliged to pay the medical bills. Because the worker or injured person elects to pursue the claim, they are saying, `We are out of this; you are on your own, brother.' In fact, the worker is doing them a favour by pursuing another source of liability. If they are too silly to realise that and get together and work out a code such that they are prepared to honour the thrust and the substance of their contractual obligations, they are on notice that they will ultimately have legislation forced upon them. One might speculate that the reason people are leaving private health insurers is that the funds are not demonstrating good faith in regard to the extent of benefits people think they have contracted for. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As all of the previous speakers have said, this is a very serious issue and one that occurs, tragically, not uncommonly around Australia where someone has an accident, their ability to work or to be a carer in the home is impaired and they face huge medical costs. If they have been privately insured they often discover to their regret, as Mr Vercoe did, that they had not read the small print in their insurers policy documentation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How did we get to this situation where private health insurance companies do not automatically continue to pay while they have one of their clients in the process of trying to gain compensation through the courts? It is all to do with circumstances that have gone or for a very long time. Part of this problem is that it has been quite common in very long and protected court hearings leading to, eventually, quite large pay-outs that often the decision has made no reference for the claim 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ant to refund any moneys that have been paid by the fund during the compensation process. The payouts have tended to relate to pain and suffering and future medical expenses. Hence the funds, not surprisingly, have found themselves out of pocket. It is very difficult sometimes too for the claimant, who is finally paid not in a lump sum but in a series of, say, weekly payments, to accumulate the funds to pay back the sum that the private insurance company may have paid to them during the period they were seeking compensation. So this is a very difficult situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also difficult because it is very firmly in the private sector, where commercial undertakings are negotiated between someone who wants to buy a service, in this case insurance, and someone who is prepared to sell that service. As well, it belongs in the state's jurisdiction. Determination of compensable status and management of compensation schemes is a state government responsibility. Also, generally the injured person is processed through the public hospital system. I am sure that the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) is concerned that state public hospitals often charge compensable patients considerably higher&mdash;around $400 per day compared to a health insured patient at $213 per day. So, as you can see, there are all sorts of expectations built into the system that there will be some sort of reaping of benefits at the end of the day with this compensation payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extraordinarily difficult for a government to talk about forcing a private sector provider of services to do anything in terms of clients when a contract between the two has been drawn up which clearly states that there are certain circumstances where payments will not be made. It is a very difficult situation. When the pain and suffering is being felt the person feels that they should be covered. I believe that what we have to do is what we are currently doing now with the Australian population at large. We are saying to them: `For heaven's sake, before you go and have any procedures, for example in a hospital, negotiate, talk to the doctors and the anaesthetists, to the various health service 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11607"> providers and to the private hospital itself and ask what all of the various services are going to cost you. Ask how many procedures you are going to have. Ask whether there is going to be a gap between what you are insured for and what the various service providers are going to charge you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to have an informed public when it comes to medical services costs in this country. Without an informed public, we end up having situations like Mr Vercoe found himself in. He had a contract. He did not understand that contract. After he was injured he felt poorly done by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a serious and complex matter. It is a case where we have to ask the insurance companies to make much greater effort in explaining exactly what they are prepared to do with their clients. We have to expect people seeking insurance in these areas in the future to shop around.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last weekend I spent time talking to small businesses and shopkeepers in my electorate, as I often do. Their comments bear repeating in this place. Firstly, there was an acknowledgment of the benefits of some of the government's policies, which are really beginning to help them. These included lower interest rates, changes to FBT, capital gains tax relief and industrial relations reform. They were also very pleased with the `Fair Go for Small Business' package, which will be a valuable step in protecting small businesses, such as retailers and franchisees, from unfair conduct by larger operators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also interesting was the comment that they are feeling more secure, knowing that the government is really getting a handle on the country's debt problems. The comment was quite rightly made by one shopkeeper, `If we hadn't been seriously addressing government debt and national debt, the Asian currency crisis would have hit us much more severely.' It was encouraging to see that this government's responsible management is bringing a sense of security to our small business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast to these positive comments, two main areas of concern were expressed. One was the need for tax reform. `The current tax 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11608"> system is unfair and unworkable and the wholesale sales tax system is a mess,' I was told. The second was the need for progress on unfair dismissal laws. `It is not worth the risk of putting someone on under the current laws,' was the message from one shopkeeper. `Tell the Senate to stop obstructing this legislation. Tell them to get out of the way so that small business can do something about hiring people.' That was the clear message I received. This government has done far more for small business in 18 months than the former mob ever thought of doing in 13 years.

I want to put a challenge to the Leader of the Opposition today: that he use his 10 minutes wisely tonight when he goes to record his remarks, and announces his withdrawal of his amendments which delete schedule 4, which provides a very conservative confirmation of native title over a group of leases, including leases where we believe there has been intended exclusive possession.

Is the minister aware that proposed Labor amendments to the government's native title bill will not allow state and territory governments to give legal certainty to many titles for major mining and resource projects? What are the implications of Labor's proposals for the Australian economy and the mining industry in particular?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. It is a very important one. The fact of the matter is that this parliament and the nation have an unprecedented opportunity to re&hyphen;establish certainty and goodwill among those living and working in non&hyphen;metropolitan Australia, and we ought to take it. The 10&hyphen;point plan and the current bill based on it represent the correct balance between competing interests of parties, including Aboriginal people, those in the mining and resource sectors, and our primary producers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Labor is proposing amendments to this bill which would specifically prevent state and territory governments from validating any resource project approved after 1 January 1994 under special enabling legislation known as a state agreement act or an indenture act. These acts are used to facilitate large&hyphen;scale resource projects, where it just happens that certainty of title is of major and very understandable concern to developers who are investing billions of dollars in this country. Labor's proposed validation provision would create major uncertainty for titles issued over the past few years for several major mining and resource development projects, particularly, as it happens, in Western Australia and in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11613"> Queensland under the special states legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are talking here about many, many thousands of jobs&mdash;jobs where they are needed most of all in this country, in our remote and regional areas. We are dealing with a minerals sector which has a track record of backing its optimism with investment and with job opportunities. It needs to be noted that we are not talking purely about minerals when it comes to that; the uncertainty would also spread to domestic gas projects, which in turn will help significantly to address greenhouse issues in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line issue is straightforward. Under Labor's amendments, titles for these projects could not be validated and developers would be forced to negotiate agreements with native title holders on a retrospective basis in the case of those investments already under way or operational, which would be an extraordinary and unworkable situation. Even if such agreements were to go ahead, project proponents would find that they still did not have certainty because, fundamentally, legal validity cannot be provided by an agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in net terms, what do Labor's amendments give us? Even more uncertainty, fewer jobs and a downgrading of much needed export income. As my colleague, the Minister for Resources and Energy, has made quite clear, mining companies will always seek to reach a negotiated settlement with any holder of a valid title over which exploration or mining titles are sought. This makes it all the more important for us to have a native title system which works in the real world and which has an effective registration test which ensures that only credible claimants gain the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Labor is offering a native title legacy of confusion, delay and lost opportunities&mdash;frustrating to all parties. For both social and economic reasons, especially in rural and remote Australia, certainty ought to be re&hyphen;established now.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some very good news around for small business. That is not to say that some people in small business have not done it tough&mdash;of course they have. There are businesses that still feel the aftershock of Labor's depression/recession back in the early 1990s. At the same time, there are some small businesses that are really starting to pick up and they are starting to build their confidence. That is a good thing because, as confidence grows, it spreads around the small business community. I think that, given the leadership that this government has shown and the improved circumstances for small business that we have introduced, they have good reason to have that greater sense of confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week the Yellow Pages index came out, with some excellent news for the small business community. It showed that sales growth in small business has been the highest since small business came out of Labor's recession in 1994. It showed that profit growth was up, as well as sales growth. That is good news for the small business community. It also showed that small business proprietors' confidence has been at its highest level for 2&half; years&mdash;another reflection of the good and strong policy initiatives that this government has introduced for the benefit of the small business community.

The importance for all of us to note from that is that we do need to do more to assist small business to give somebody a job. The thing that you can do is to vote for and support our exemption for small business from the unfair dismissal law. Labor is opposed to it.

Each month the debt goes out paying those loans brought in from overseas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I had the extension of time, a couple of hours would just see us through the first couple of years.

Do you remember June 1994: the factional infighting&mdash;`Shall we or shall we not sell ANL?'&mdash;and unions threatening industrial action?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then on 22 August 1994 there were these great immortal words in the incompetent management of the previous government, the words of the member for Kingsford-Smith: `You couldn't give it away; that's the reality.' Four months earlier he had announced its sale. Four months later `you could not give it away'. Then what did he do? The board of ANL had to walk the plank. They walked the plank and in walked the Labor cronies to take out $820,000, thank you very much. Their job was to sell ANL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A wry smile appears on the Leader of the Opposition's face. It should be a smile of gross embarrassment. Then we had a national waterfront stoppage&mdash;remember that one&mdash;in September 1994. Then on 15 September 1994 a wonderful package was announced! The brotherhood had come to a deal. The deal was that the MUA would buy ANL using superannuation funds. Let us remember that it would have been only three weeks earlier that the member for Kingsford-Smith had announced to all that `you could not give it away; that's the reality'. He was going to sell it to the MUA. By Christmas that deal was off. What is happening in February 1995? They have

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's response to HIV is one that could be best described as one of enlightened pragmatism, and it has been successful. We have had 20,706 infections known to us so far. But our rate of infection has dropped dramatically from a peak of 3,000 infections a year in 1983, at the beginning of the epidemic, to 500 infections a year in 1997. The cornerstone of our response has been a partnership between affected communities and governments at all levels. But we need to recognise that Australia is and always will be part of a worldwide epidemic. So this year we have adopted the UN theme for World AIDS Day, children living in a world with AIDS. Each day worldwide at least 1,000 children contract HIV. In 1996, at best estimate, 350,000 children died of HIV.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member asked about education, treatments and research. The education strategy we pursue puts about $2 million a year into education and, according to the third strategy, focuses on the three groups most at risk: homosexually active men, IV drug users and indigenous people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of treatments, there has been very good news in the last two years. We are now using combination therapies and new therapies, and most would believe that a very dramatic drop in deaths is due to these treatments. Of course, they are no magic cure. They do not eliminate the virus from the body altogether. They just reduce the virus to a rate where the body can live with it. Some people do develop a tolerance to the drugs and they no longer work, but they do give reason for optimism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of research, Australia is amongst the world leaders on HIV research. We fund a centre for epidemiology and clinical research. We fund a HIV virology centre. We fund a centre for HIV social research, as well as having specific HIV research grants. It is often put to me that we spend too much on HIV and not on other areas of research. To that I would say that there are several reasons for doing this. Firstly, HIV is a new disease that is teaching us a lot of new things about virology. We now have over 12 anti-retroviral drugs. We had virtually none 12 years ago. These drugs will have substantial spin&hyphen;offs into other areas of health. Secondly, HIV is a communicable disease which, unlike cancer, can spread to one who can spread it to 100 who can spread it to 10,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we do not fund research on an illness basis. We fund research on the basis of where we have expertise. Australia clearly has expertise in an area such as immunology. We fund that at a far higher level than we would if we were merely dividing it up between individual diseases&mdash;similarly, with HIV. Australia's response is one that we can be proud of. It is one that all members of this House can be proud of because it is one that has been successful and that has been forged over 12 years through a bipartisan approach and enlightened pragmatism.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. The matter is one of very real concern. It is confronting many countries around the world. It is an experience that in Europe and the United States there has been quite considerable evidence of trafficking in human beings as a multi-billion dollar global industry. It appears that we certainly are not immune from what has been happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most visible evidence of this has been the illegal arrival of more than 2,900 people by boats since 1989. Many are known to have paid thousands of dollars to come. While some of them were shown to be refugees and received Australia's protection, the great bulk of people certainly have not earned that entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the larger and growing problem is the one that people now speak about as the arrival of `jumbo people'. They are people who come on scheduled flights and often arrive without documentation. If they do have documentation, frequently it is fraudulent, and often they have a non bona fide purpose. To give you some idea of what has happened in 1996-97, 1,350 people have been refused entry at Australian airports. This is an increase of quite a considerable dimension&mdash;485 in 1994-95; 663 in 1995-96. A third of them came without documentation and one-quarter of them with fraudulent documentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My department believes that at least 75 per cent of such people have been linked to trafficking operations. We have seen people with elaborate transport plans, people swapping boarding passes in transit lounges, photo substitution in passports as well as use of genuine documents which have been fraudu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lently obtained. This is a matter of very real concern. We have seen a significant number of visitors who arrive in Australia overstaying or working in contravention of visa conditions. We currently have 45,100 people who have overstayed visas. That does not include those who have made bona fide protection claims or those who are abusing the refugee system to delay their departure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is very concerned about the integrity of our boarders. We presently have bills in the other place which will enable us to have a faster and more efficient system for dealing with claims, and a bill dealing with a proposal to eliminate abuse of the judicial review process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to give honourable members some idea of what has been happening, in 1989-90 we received eight applications from Filipino citizens for refugee status. This year&mdash;1996-97&mdash;we have received 1,740 such applications from the Philippines. I could give many like examples. As I have repeatedly said, if people have bona fide claims, they will be acknowledged and dealt with, but when the system is being abused, as it clearly is, and when people are being encouraged by those who are taking money from them to arrange such entries to Australia, we have a significant problem. It will become more significant as we get closer to the Olympics.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Can the minister inform the House of the changes from today of the management of the CES and the launch yesterday of the government's public employment placement enterprise? How will these reforms improve the service for job seekers and employers?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="11621" SPEAKER="Kemp, Dr David, MP" NAMEID="BT4" ELECTORATE="Goldstein" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. Today marks the start of the most significant reforms in 50 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years to improve services for job seekers and employers and get more unemployed people into jobs. For the first time there is now competition between the CES and private employment agencies to place people in jobs. It heralds a new era of competition in job placement services for the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some $16.2 million of Commonwealth funds have been contracted out to some 300 private and community agencies to find jobs for 65,000 unemployed people over the next five months. From today the CES will be managed by a new government owned enterprise, Employment National. These arrangements are part of the transition to the full employment services market which will come into place on 1 May next year when the Commonwealth will be contracting out $1.7 billion worth of job placement and job assistance services to private, community and public employment agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These improved services will provide significant benefits to job seekers, employers and taxpayers. The new competitive services are going to ensure that from today private job placement agencies will be paid when they place an unemployed person in a job, and only when they place an unemployed person in a job. The focus on jobs will continue from 1 May when all providers will only be paid in full when they place an unemployed person in a job. The incentives will also be targeted to the most disadvantaged job seekers, with the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups attracting the highest placement fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes mean that the coalition government can now make a number of commitments to job seekers, to employers and to the community. First, more unemployed people will get jobs, especially the long-term unemployed. There will be many more vacancies available through the system than the 20 per cent of vacancies currently available through the CES. Second, job seekers will never again have to be churned through the kind of short&hyphen;term training programs which were so characteristic of the Labor Party's Working Nation schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Third, assistance will be tailored to the individual jobseeker's needs. The provider 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11622"> will be able to offer each jobseeker precisely the kind of intensive assistance that is required to get them a job&mdash;not the inflexible bureaucratic training programs that were characteristic of the Labor Party. Fourth, under a coalition government, taxpayers will no longer have to pay for schemes which cost $143,000 a job and which had a four per cent success rate. The fact is that since the Labor Party failed jobseekers it has been up to this government to put in place the kinds of effective equity programs that will get unemployed people jobs.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">did not pay anything like enough attention when in government to the early years of schooling. The evidence is now clear. If problems that emerge in the first few years of schooling with literacy and other basic skills are not identified and effectively addressed, then a vicious cycle sets in which the student falls further behind, becomes demoralised, starts to misbehave and falls further behind.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What the government has had to do is, after 13 years of neglect, put in place literacy programs that will finally give these disadvantaged young people a chance in life. Under this government, there has so far been unprecedented cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states. For the first time, there is now a national literacy and numeracy plan. Under this plan the states and territories have agreed to assess every child's literacy and numeracy level at the end of grade 3 and grade 5 against national benchmarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Progress towards nationally comparable reporting by systems and school authorities was also agreed, to be based on rigorous state based assessment procedures. These agreements are already in place. They are so far beyond anything that was put in place under the previous years of the Labor government that it is only now, for the first time, that parents in this country can be assured their young people will get the literacy skills they need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The literacy benchmarks that the Victorian minister has commented on have been considered by the Curriculum Corporation under the direction of the benchmarking task force and comprises representatives of all the states and territories and the non-government systems. Victoria is on that benchmarking task force, and it has been a party to the entire process. The literacy benchmarks have been developed after extensive consultation with a whole range of expert groups, including those who are key academic students of literacy in this country. These benchmarks will be considered at the MCEETYA meeting to be held on 11 December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that parents in Victoria will be very disappointed if they believe that the Victorian government is seeking to delay the process which will bring educational justice to young people in that state. Mr Gude has unfortunately put himself on the side of lower

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. I think it should be noted that the honourable member for North Sydney has played a very active role in the development of the long-term operating plan for Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney&mdash;along with a number of other members in this chamber, not just from the government side. We should acknowledge the work of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, which is chaired by the member for North Sydney, and also the work of members from both sides&mdash;the member for Lowe, the member for Wentworth, the member for Cook, the member for Grayndler, the member for Watson, the member for Barton and also the member for Bennelong, all who have an interest in flight paths and aircraft noise in the Sydney basin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the last election, the coalition government made a commitment with regard to the operations at Kingsford Smith airport. The first was that we were going to reopen the east-west runway. That was done in very quick order with the `sharp' work of the honourable member for Hume. We have delivered on that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second commitment we made was that we were going to more equitably distribute the noise problem in Sydney. This week we are going to deliver on that commitment in full. With the advent of the long&hyphen;term operat 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing plan, which starts this Thursday, of the Kingsford Smith airport we will see targets set whereby 55 per cent of movements will be to the south over water, 17 per cent of movements will be north, 13 per cent east and 15 per cent west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should also note the activities that have taken place with regard to the SACF committee, which is chaired by the member for North Sydney, in dealing with that consultative process since the middle of last year until we reached this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This long-term operating plan with Kingsford Smith airport is not just a plan that has been devised by this government. Ten thousand submissions have been made to Airservices Australia. My department, Airservices Australia, the Sydney Airport Community Forum and the Federal Airports Corporation have all worked together to establish the long-term operating plan that will be operating from this Thursday out of Kingsford Smith airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important to note again the percentages of those movements: 55 per cent to the south, 17 per cent to the north, 13 per cent to the east and 15 per cent to the west. We should compare those with the percentages of flight movements that operated out of KSA when the last change was made by the previous government, when the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith was the minister responsible. When the parallel operations started under the previous government, 47 per cent of movements were going over the electorate of Grayndler and further on to the north; we saw 51 per cent to the south and we saw one per cent to the west. How many did we see to the east, over the electorate of the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith? One per cent. We saw one per cent under that plan!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will reiterate: as of this Thursday, there will be 55 per cent of movements to the south, 17 per cent of movements to the north, over the electorates of the member for Grayndler, the member for North Sydney and the member for Bennelong; 13 per cent to the east; and 15 per cent to the west. That is a fair share of aircraft noise in Sydney.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11624">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that the people of Sydney recognise the fact that this is a community plan developed with community consultation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to speak to this private member's motion put forward by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron). I speak not only as a person with experience in medical politics and the development and enunciation of health financing policy but also as a doctor who has stood by the bedside of an elderly person in the midst of a public housing estate on numerous occasions when they have woken to find themselves having suffered a stroke or similar medical catastrophe in the early hours of the morning knowing that, if I send them to the public hospital, after six or seven hours in the department of emergency medicine they will be sent home and told that there is no bed for them. Such Australians&mdash;elderly people, low income people, vulnerable people&mdash;buy private health insurance not only to avoid waiting lists for joint replacements and other forms of elective surgery but so that they can get access to a bed when they know they need to be in one and when their doctors feel that is where they ought to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian health financing system has evolved from egalitarian principles and an extremely strong health insurance ethic. But 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11628"> unfortunately, over 13 years the Labor government politically and financially discouraged people from taking out private health insurance. When he was the Minister for Health, in April of 1992 the then minister Brian Howe said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Private health insurance makes an insignificant contribution to Australia's health financing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet it was raising in excess of $3 billion when the Medicare levy was raising $2.5 billion. That comment from the Labor health minister was the tip of an iceberg of ideological resentment of low income people in particular, whom they purport to represent, getting access to private health care. On 13 October that year, 1992, when I suggested to the then minister Brian Howe certain initiatives that would be required by the government of the day, whatever its political colour, to see that there was affordable access for high risk and low income people, he said to me: `Brendan, don't bother telling me what you think. If you want to change anything this government's doing, you'll have to change the government.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The culmination of this attitude was during the March 1993 election campaign, when from the Royal Adelaide Hospital the then Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating&mdash;reported at the time to be worth something like $5 million&mdash;told Australians they didn't need private health insurance. He said they did not need it because they could rely on Medicare and it was doing a great job for them. On the same day one of my patients, who was a pensioner and a volunteer cleaner in the offices of a then Labor minister, said to me: `Dr Nelson, I go without food to pay for it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember the newspapers over Christmas 1995 reporting that the Hawkes, the Keatings, the Whitlams and other doyens of the Labor Party had gone into one of the most prestigious private hospitals in Australia&mdash;an act of which I am not at all critical; rather, it is the hypocrisy of their then telling the rest of the country, including a million families earning less than $40,000 a year, 850,000 pensioners and half a million people on health care cards, that they in some way do not need private health insurance. It is all very well for people driving the social justice truck to try to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> impose the same misery on everybody when they can take the parachute of paying cash to go into a private hospital but in the end the government of the day, as it does in education, has a responsibility to see that we have affordable access for low income and high risk individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government withdrew its financial support to the reinsurance pool for the cost of insuring those over the age of 65, it removed its private bed day subsidy in 1986, it forced the private funds to cover 25 per cent of the Medicare benefit schedule fee, it pushed expensive prostheses on to basic tables, it then locked into the 1993 Medicare agreements powerful disincentives for having privately insured patients in public hospitals, so much so that nine per cent of public hospital income, which was then derived from the treatment of privately insured patients, has now dropped to less than three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the Australian Labor Party at its 1998 annual conference to adopt a policy which seeks to achieve some kind of bipartisanship in relation to support for private health insurance. There is not a place for ideological dogma in this. As in education, it is very important that the government of the day, irrespective of its political colour, uphold its political and economic responsibilities to low income people to give them support when they need it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition parties in this country have always campaigned strongly on the issue of preserving Labor's health policies. Whether it is the Fraser government or the Howard government, those governments when in opposition prior to their election have always campaigned very strongly on the platform that they would retain Medicare, they would retain Medibank, they would retain Labor's health initiatives to the full extent in their policy. But when those governments have subsequently been elected, only then have the people of Australia discovered that those promises were not `core' promises; they were `non&hyphen;core' promises. That meant in the case of the Fraser government that Medibank was savagely undermined, savagely cut. That government did everything that it possibly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11629"> could with the now Prime Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), as its Treasurer to remove Medibank from the Australian political lexicon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign the Prime Minister strongly and loudly advocated that Labor's health policy would be retained by him in office. But when we get them to office, what happens? The public again discover that this is a non-core promise and his government immediately proceeds to take hundreds of millions of dollars from Commonwealth health programs in payments to the states. It takes hundreds of millions of dollars from the Commonwealth dental program, leaving underprivileged people and pensioners without adequate access to dental care. It spends hundreds of millions&mdash;even $1.5 billion over three years&mdash;funding a subsidy to private health insurance, a subsidy which is immediately taken back by the health funds in significant increases to their premiums, increases which were approved by this government firstly by the junior officials in the department and then, when the government discovered to its embarrassment that the subsidy was soon to be eaten up by these increases, a committee consisting of the Minister for Health (Dr Wooldridge), the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) took over the task. They discovered that they also were in a position where they had to approve those very same kinds of increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, even before the subsidy was to be paid to Australians, they were discovering that bit by bit it was being eaten away by the health funds increasing their premiums&mdash;as any person might reasonably have expected they would, given the opportunity which the Howard government handed to them, the cheque which they handed to them on a plate. This government has wasted hundreds of millions of dollars which it could have given to our public hospitals by way of direct payments to the states, which would have increased the availability of funding for patients in our public hospitals, reduced the waiting lists and allowed patients to get their operations sooner, which would have made 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Medicare system work even better. Instead those funds were diverted into an ineffective subsidy to private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has that bought? It has bought almost nothing. Hundreds of millions of dollars have gone into purchasing a very small change in the trend in private health insurance. Part of that would be attributable not so much to the carrot as to the stick which this government applied by requiring higher income earners to purchase private insurance or face an increase in their levy. Those hundreds of millions of dollars have bought almost no change in that scenario; they have bought a significant undermining of the government's credibility in health insurance and health care policy. This government promised not only to pay that subsidy to Australians who bought private health insurance&mdash;certainly, that was part of the policy and I accept that that was part of the mandate&mdash;but also that the subsidy would not come from the payments to the states, from the payments to hospitals and from the payments for health care policy in this country&mdash;but it did. In budget after budget we have seen those payments undermined, reduced and slashed by this government to the point where that in itself is undermining Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let us not have the hypocrisy of calling on the Australian Labor Party to amend its policies on private health insurance. We have a very clear policy on it. We support Medicare&mdash;we invented that concept of public insurance in Australia&mdash;and we have provided sound public health policies for this country. It is the coalition government, through its diversion of funds from proper public health care to the private health sector&mdash;those subsidies&mdash;which is undermining health care in this country, undermining public support for Medicare and preventing our fine public hospitals from doing the kind of job which they are able to do when they get adequate support and resources from government. They did that job under us; they are not going to be able to do it under this government because the funds have been taken away. The hypocrisy, I suspect, lies in the way in which the coalition parties have treated the Australian

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this motion put forward by the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron). It is important to understand that the Australian health system relies on a combination of both public and private systems&mdash;one cannot work without the other. The challenge is getting the balance right. Until recently we have had a private system that was haemorrhaging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government supports freedom of choice for all Australian families wherever possible. Australians should be able to choose whether they want to belong to a trade union. Parents should be able to choose whether they send their children to public or private schools. Families should be able to choose whether they want public or private health care. This freedom of choice philosophy is in sharp contrast with that of the Labor Party, which behaves as if ordinary Australians are not clever enough to make their own choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor are the party of whingeing hypocrites. Labor whinge about unemployment, but they did nothing about it for 13 years. Labor whinge about the standard of living of the workers they claim to represent, but, in just a decade of Labor, Australia fell from 10th to 22nd on the world income table. For the first time ever, we fell behind one of our neighbours, Singapore. We were overtaken by strike-ridden France, also under a socialist regime. Labor would even whinge about the budget deficit they created&mdash;that is, if they understood it. Labor whinge about the government's aged care reforms, but they ran down capital expenditure on nursing homes by over 75 per cent in the Keating&hyphen;Hawke years. As a result, hospitals in Ballina, Murwillumbah and Tweed Heads in my electorate all have a large proportion of beds taken up by elderly people who should properly be in nursing homes. And now Labor whinge about falling private health fund membership, but they did nothing about it for a decade. When they took office in 1983, private health cover was more than 60 per cent; when they were thrown out last year, that figure had dropped to a low of 30 per cent. This is yet another example of Labor mismanagement which led 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to this crisis&mdash;a crisis which is not of our making but which we are, nevertheless, setting out to fix. First, we introduced a one per cent Medicare surcharge for high income earners without private health cover. Then we brought in a tax incentive scheme to boost the membership of health funds&mdash;a $450 tax rebate for families in private funds. These measures took effect this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The immediate result was that in the September quarter of 1997 we had the first increase in private health fund membership for over seven years. An extra 34,000 Australians were covered by private health insurance. This should be welcomed by the opposition. But what did the shadow spokesman, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), have to say? `The figures highlight the government's total failure . . . The increase is microscopic,' he sneered. I wonder if he would describe a 34,000 vote swing against him in Dobell as `microscopic'. Other less biased observers took a different view from that of the shadow spokesman. `Turnaround eases pressure on health funds', said the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>; `Incentives give private fund membership a healthy lift', said the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. The improved figures were also welcomed by the AMA, the Medical Benefits Fund and the Australian Health Insurance Association&mdash;by just about everyone, except those on the Labor frontbench.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Richmond says, `Rubbish.' The difficulty the member for Richmond has is that the bogies and the demons he creates are often very different from the policies that the Labor Party actually advocate. The difficulty that people such as the member for Richmond have is that before the last election his party said that the centrepiece of their health policy would deliver tax breaks for private health insurance. They said that these tax breaks would make health insurance cheaper, would attract more people to private health insurance and therefore would take pressure off public hospitals. What has actually happened? Private health insurance has not become cheaper; it has become more expensive. Premium increases have swallowed up most of the benefit of that tax rebate. So we have had an increase in the cost of private health insurance, not a reduction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have we seen the promised increase in the number of people who have taken out private health insurance? No, we have seen the reverse. We have had up to 1,000 people a day leaving private health insurance despite the fact that this government has introduced the rebate. On top of that, we have seen that, as a result of those changes, we have had an increase in the pressure on public hospitals, not a decrease. The real test for these people, if they really believe that this failed tax rebate was a success, if they really think it is working, would be to advocate an increase in their failed, discredited tax rebate. If you really believe that the tax rebate was the solution to all the problems in health care, why aren't you out there persuading the Minister for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, that this policy is so successful that we should do more; let us have an even larger tax rebate? They are more to be pitied than despised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason they are not out there arguing that there should be an increase in the tax rebate is that in their heart of hearts they know that this is a lemon. This is the smallest, shrivelled lemon of a policy we have seen for decades in Australian health care. The reason it has failed is that this tax rebate has cost $1.7 billion, and that has been funded by cuts in federal funding for public hospitals of $800 million, a $500 million reduction in federal assistance for the cost of pharmaceuticals and the complete abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program. We have seen all of these cutbacks in public health programs being used to fund a tax rebate policy that has not delivered the benefits that the government claimed it would.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We only have to look at the annual report that has just come through from PHIAC, which is supervising private health insurance. That indicates that over the last year the rate of premium increases has actually grown under this government rather than reduced; people are paying more for their private health insurance. We have seen an increase in the drop&hyphen;out rate from private health insurance, despite the so&hyphen;called benefits of your tax rebate. The other thing that is buried away in that report is the confirmation that the reserve levels for the funds have dropped another $122 million in the last year. What the member for Richmond and the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) are going to have to explain to their constituents is that this indicates there is another massive tidal wave of premium increases about to hit us, which will mean that there will be a further reduction in the number of people with private health insurance, despite your failed tax rebate. It is important to get over this government's obsession with private health insurance.</PARA>

He was talking about private health insurance, and we can see why they are in so much trouble. When Labor came to power in 1983, 64 per cent of the population had private health insurance. By the time they left office in 1996, this had fallen to 34 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I really appreciate the sup 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> port of my good friend and colleague the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony). Labor did nothing to try to halt this. They have already admitted to the decline. They said, `So what? It is not a problem.' That is fantastic. I am glad to see that you people admit the mistakes in what you put in place. In fact, when you really look at it, Labor hastened the decline by withdrawing the existing subsidies and pushing more costs onto the funds. I take it for granted you would accept that as well. This added to the funds' costs by about $850 million a year, which the Productivity Commission estimates has meant that premiums are 30 per cent higher than they would otherwise have been. We have already heard an admission from the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on the Labor Party side that they admit that the way they ran private health insurance meant that there was an incredible drop in membership while they were in power.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again he says, `So what?' You could not care less about the people out there in this country. I cannot believe that you would say that. It is incredible. It just goes to show how hypocritical and irresponsible you people really were. Why are premiums increasing? Premiums have been rising by about 12 per cent a year for the last 12 years. I would like to hear what the member for Werriwa's comments are in relation to that. Premiums only increased because the funds' payouts to their members have risen by an even greater amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reflects three things: first, members are claiming more money in benefits than the fund is earning in contribution income. Secondly, the decline in the membership over the last decade has meant that most of the funds now have a very high proportion of members who are very costly to insure. The opposition have admitted that as the reason for the decline; they totally accept that. They say, `So what?' Old age or chronic illness are reasons why it has become very costly to insure people. Thirdly, health care generally has risen in cost much faster than inflation because of costly technology and other factors.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11633">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it absolutely incredible&mdash;I am still overwhelmed by the fact&mdash;that the member for Werriwa has come forward and admitted that it was because of their poor policies, their poor legislation and the way they ran and `assisted' private health insurance that it destroyed itself. It is incredible that he is prepared to admit that, but it is great that at least he has had the gumption to come forward and say that he is responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving on from that, a successful private health insurance industry means that people who can afford to insure themselves against potential hospital health care costs leave the public health system available to those who can ill afford to pay. Mr Keating, a former Prime Minister in the Labor era, did not have private health insurance. He depended on the public system. I can see no reason why a man on an income like that could not have at least put his best foot forward and his hand in his pocket instead of denying a pensioner a place. Who is public health there for&mdash;people of extreme wealth like that? There is no reason why he could not have afforded his own private health insurance. If the majority of people living in this country attempt to access the public health system, the queues will grow. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), one of the real intellectual giants in the modern National Party, expressed some concern or surprise that I might say, `So what?' to the news that membership of private health funds in Australia has fallen for the past decade. There are two basic reasons why I say, `So what?' The first, if you look at the international evidence in health economics, is that there is no natural balance or equilibrium between the public and the private share in health care. What really matters is service utilisation. What matters is the delivery of services to people who need health care. The second reason relates to statistics: the proportion of national health expenditure funded out of health insurance funds at the introduction of Medicare in 1984 was 8.8 per cent&mdash;that is, close to one&hyphen;tenth of all the health expenditure in Australia at the introduction of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Medicare in 1984 came out of the health funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there were a crisis in private health insurance in Australia, one would logically expect that figure to drop. One would think that people were using less private health insurance service utilisation than they were at the introduction of Medicare. The figures throughout the 1990s have actually gone up. There is a higher proportion of national health expenditure funded out of insurance funds in the 1990s than there was in 1984. The latest figures I looked at were over 11 per cent. So there is no crisis in private health insurance. This is one of the great lasting myths of Australian politics&mdash;talk of a crisis in the private health funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened is that membership has fallen. Those people who have stayed in the funds who need the services have actually increased their rate of service utilisation. Health insurance in Australia is contributing more to health care than it was at the introduction of Medicare. So why would government want to further subsidise private health insurance? Why would government want to put $500 million into a direct subsidy to the private health funds when, at the same time, it is taking $800 million out of its contribution to public hospitals?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is bad health economics. This is an appalling piece of public policy. At a time when the funds are doing more and their reserves are higher, why would the government want to subsidise those funds by half a billion dollars when the public hospitals which need the support are losing $800 million of Commonwealth funding? This is the health economics of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Keystone Cops</EMPHASIS>. This is the maddest piece of public policy that one will ever see out of the Commonwealth parliament. This is a first&hyphen;rate absurdity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) has come here trying to perpetuate this myth of a crisis in private health insurance but I think it is a bad use of the House's time. Quite simply, this House should look at the figures for health expenditure utilisation and note that those Australians who have private health insurance are using more of the services and are contributing a higher propor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11634"> tion of total health expenditure in Australia in the 1990s than they were at the introduction of Medicare in 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for why people have dropped out of the funds, that is quite simple: they were not getting value for money. The Liberal Party, not necessarily known for its public subsidisation policies, says that those people should not be exercising free choice to drop out but that goes against 20 or 30 years of their ideology. What happened to the party of choice? What happened to the party of market&hyphen;driven operations? What happened to the party allowing competition between private and public health shares? People who were not getting value for money, such as younger, healthier people&mdash;I was one of those who dropped out for valid reasons&mdash;have found that they can rely, particularly during acute health care needs, on the public hospital system. That is what they found under the Labor government, but now the money is being ripped out of public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have dropped out for valid reasons. There is no need for a subsidy to be developed by the Commonwealth government, especially when the private health funds have record reserves and assets. These are not organisations that are down on their knees financially; these are organisations which are doing better than ever, so why would they need public subsidies? Why do we need to take scarce public resources and put them in the hands of private health funds, all at a time when waiting lists around Australia for public hospital beds have consistently lengthened?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is a problem with public hospital waiting lists, treat the patient at the source and put the $500 million into public hospitals so they can do something about the problem of waiting lists. Why go all the way around, bloating the private health fund reserves at a time when those reserves and those funds are doing more by way of their contribution to health expenditure and service utilisation in Australia? As I said, and I will keep on saying it, it is the maddest piece of public policy you will ever see in this place and the government stands condemned, as does the member for Stirling.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">It gives me no pleasure to be moving this motion in the House today. In the first year of the Howard government, from March 1996 to March 1997, the ACT economy contracted by 1.1 per cent. Over this period, gross state product fell in three successive quarters and we had one quarter of zero growth. Two successive quarters of negative growth constitute a recession, hence the ACT was placed in recession. The ACT recorded the worst economic performance of any state or territory in the March 1997 quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While more recent figures show the ACT economy is beginning to rise from the depths to which it fell in the first year of the Howard government, many areas of the economy, such as housing and business investment, remain at historically low levels. We have seen an increase in the rate of personal bankruptcy in the territory of 59.8 per cent in 1996&hyphen;97&mdash;the highest of any state or territory. That statistic is according to the advice of the CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service, a service which has seen an increase of 38.6 per cent in the number of people they see in financial crisis in the past 12 months.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11635">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised during the federal election campaign that public sector downsizing would be limited to 2,500. That was repeated again and again. In its first year, the government abolished 12,600 Public Service jobs and, according to the government's own budget papers, a further 16,500 jobs will be lost in the public sector in the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year. Of course, the multiplier effect means that several thousand positions in the private sector have been and will continue to be lost. Another 8,500 jobs will go with the government's implementation of the Defence Efficiency Review. With the outsourcing of the Commonwealth's IT infrastructure, further massive job cuts are expected from 1998&hyphen;99 and we think at least 1,000 jobs are threatened in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment is an enormous concern to the ACT community. In trend terms, when the Carnell Liberal government was elected in the ACT in February 1995, the unemployment figure was seven per cent. When the Howard Liberal government was elected in March 1996 it had risen to eight per cent. As of October 1997 it has been sitting at 8.4 per cent. Youth unemployment is also an extreme concern to our community. In that same period it has consistently bounced between 30 and 50 per cent. I use that terminology because obviously in the ACT the sample group is small and the figures can be very volatile. But it has never gone below 30 per cent and it has reached as high as 50 per cent. It has consistently remained above the national average. For example, ABS figures show that the unemployment rate for 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds nearly doubled in the 15 months of the Carnell government: from June 1995 at 13.9 per cent to June 1996 at 25.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Public Service terms, the rate of employment in the ACT has fallen at both levels. At the ACT Public Service level it has fallen by 7.6 per cent since the ACT Liberal government was elected nearly three years ago and at the Commonwealth level by 7.8 per cent since the Howard government came to power. This has led to an overall decline in employment in the ACT of around 4.5 per cent through all sectors up until December 1996. The unemployment rate in the ACT has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increased five consecutive months. What does the future hold? A legitimate question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ANZ job ad survey trend figures continue to show a decline in job ads in the most recent statistics available. The participation rate continues to fall as more discouraged workers leave the labour market. Again I ask: what does the future hold? In my view, the day we see both the ACT Liberal government and the Howard federal government voted out is the day that we will have an employment and economic future in the ACT that this community can look forward to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service's statistics on bankruptcy and their client requirements&mdash;and they are a unique service in the ACT&mdash;have continued to increase at alarming levels. When you meet people in the street they have two major concerns. Firstly, if they are already in employment they have no idea for how long they will retain that employment, and their families live daily with insecurity, not knowing their future. Secondly, if they are out of employment they have absolutely no idea when they may be able to gain it. That is based on the total lack of confidence in both levels of government in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both levels of government, the Carnell government at ACT level and the Howard government at federal level, stand condemned for what their actions have done to the ACT community. I thoroughly recommend the motion. I know that future speakers from my side will add more to this debate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion by the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) is clearly designed as a desperate attempt to get some publicity for her mates in the ACT Labor opposition as they head towards another defeat in the February 1998 elections. The thrust of her motion is about the reduction in the Public Service, youth unemployment figures and an economy in the ACT supposedly in recession. It is not, but I will come back to that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Namadgi is part of the flat earth society of the ALP. It is that section of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11636"> the ALP who made sure socialism was kept in their party platform. They kept it there because that is what they believe in. They believe in government controlling all and providing for all. So the member for Namadgi cannot accept that Australia's overall economy will run better with a smaller government&mdash;one that pays its way and one that encourages private sector investment, which is the only way to create and sustain proper jobs. She wants to go back to a big spending government, putting the bill on the Beazley bankcard. That is her solution. She relishes the opportunity to give future generations a big bill, or so it would seem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say a few words about changes in the Public Service and their impact on Canberra. The member for Namadgi's motion mentions significant reduction in Public Service employment in the ACT from federal and territory budget cuts. I am sure the member for Namadgi is fair and reasonable, so I am sure she is also referring to changes that took place under the former Labor government. Or is she being selective? We all know that the former Labor government made some dramatic changes to the Australian Public Service which saw many in the ACT lose their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between 1983 and 1996&mdash;through 13 years&mdash;over 23,000 Australian public servants were retrenched, but they would make you think that reductions in the Public Service started when the Howard government was elected. What did she say then? Where were the motions at that time? She was a member of the ACT Legislative Assembly during the very big decrease in the Public Service under Keating. I am sure she was not moving any motions against her federal colleagues, the same as the CPSU were absolutely silent year after year. I do not recall her being concerned at the debt the previous Labor government was clocking up&mdash;debt that means her constituents have to watch about $9 billion of taxpayers' money per year being spent on servicing the interest on that large debt, predominantly clocked up in the last five years of Labor. I am sure her constituents would prefer to see that $9 billion being spent on services like health and education.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly want to do that, but we cannot do it until we reduce that debt, and part of the process is to get the budget out of deficit and into surplus. We will do that next year, and the member for Namadgi should be congratulating us. With the budget in surplus and the debt being reduced, we will be able to give extra benefits that I am sure her constituents want&mdash;on top of the benefits they have already received through low interest rates and low inflation. Interest rates have seen average home mortgage repayments drop by about $300 per month, and that is a real benefit that people understand. Labor want to keep spending on top of spending, and their only solution will inevitably be higher taxes. The member for Namadgi should be honest enough to tell her constituents that that is what Labor propose to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me deal with some of the claims made by the member for Namadgi. She claims that the ACT economy is in recession. I think she needs a few lessons in economics because the ABS figures show three consecutive quarters of growth in gross state product&mdash;hardly a recession&mdash;with continual growth in private sector investment in the ACT since June 1996. The Yellow Pages Small Business Index for the quarter to the end of October shows that sales and profits in the ACT small business sector were the best for the past two years. The index found that a net of 33 per cent of small businesses in the ACT reported sales growth&mdash;more than double the previous quarter. The result is the strongest since the index began surveying ACT small businesses two years ago. Nearly half of small businesses expect conditions to improve further in the next quarter&mdash;a definite sign of confidence growing in the ACT small business economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Morgan and Banks job index found that employment prospects in the ACT are improving strongly. New motor vehicle registrations are on the rise, and there is consistently strong growth in retail sales. We know that retail sales right across the board in Australia have risen dramatically over the last three months, as has private investment&mdash;and investment is what it is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the ACT government is concerned, the Carnell Liberal government have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11637"> been instrumental in creating an environment conducive to growth in the private sector. Things they have been doing include granting exemption from payroll tax for two years for employees who have been out of work for more than 12 months. Payroll tax impact will also be reduced by increasing the tax threshold from $550,000 to $800,000 from 1 January 1998. Payroll tax is a significant disincentive to employ, and I know that myself. I remember going through a period of growth in my company and verging on falling into that payroll tax net. It is great disincentive to employ, until eventually you fall into it because you have people working overtime. Increasing that threshold is going to help businesses, but on the other side of the House they do not know much about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Namadgi mentioned bankruptcy figures. She thinks that somebody going bankrupt today is all because of something that has happened in the last few weeks or the last few months. She shows a total lack of understanding of how business works. Bankruptcy figures in the last 12 months or so have been caused by what Labor did in the previous few years. During the recession of the early 1990s with the high interest rates, I remember paying 21.75 per cent on my overdraft in business. You have never been there and you would not know what it is like. They are the things that send businesses bankrupt, but they do not send them bankrupt next week; it takes about 12 months to two years to happen. You do not understand how business works. You stand up here quoting bankruptcy figures, and it is all because of what happened under Keating in the last five years before we came to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Carnell government 1,542 jobs will be created over the next three years through the ACT business incentive scheme. They are really getting on and doing things. As far as youth is concerned, the Youth 500 scheme aims to create 500 jobs by Christmas. I understand that, as of last Friday, 28 November, 432 young people have found jobs as a result of that scheme. There are other schemes: $225,000 for job youthlink; youth selfstart; $625,000 for the accelerated data collection program, which is providing train 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing and employment for young people; $290,000 for the annual employment grants program; and $200,000 for Canberra's three Open Access centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a federal level, the commitments the Howard government has made to the ACT have been quite dramatic. The Federation Fund will provide $146.9 million for the development of the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies on Acton Peninsula, which will mean 1,000 jobs during their construction. Funding to the National Capital Authority was increased by 16 per cent in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget for work on the assets of the national capital. There has been $85 million committed to the ongoing redevelopment of the Russell offices and $20 million to the refurbishment of galleries in the Australian War Memorial. All of these things mean jobs in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes that have occurred in the ACT economy over the past decade&mdash;not just the past 20 months&mdash;with the shift from the public sector to the private sector is good news for the region. The ACT economy previously relied almost totally on one big client, federal government, dishing out a cheque each week. Now it is being much more diverse; it is looking around the region and growing far more naturally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion moved by the member for Namadgi is obviously part of Labor's election campaign in the ACT. She thinks she is still in the ACT Assembly. I am sure she would not want to go back there. If she did, she would still be in opposition. Kate Carnell has done a great job for the ACT, and I am confident that the people of the ACT will want her to remain Chief Minister after the next federal election.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both the federal government and the ACT government have sacked thousands of workers in the ACT as their contribution to the ACT's recession, as declared by Access Economics&mdash;not exactly a red ragging think&hyphen;tank; probably on the conservative end of the spectrum. Access Economics says that the ACT entered into a recession largely as a result of public sector redundancies, which had spin&hyphen;off 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11638"> effects on the private sector. The effects of those redundancies are seen throughout the economic indicators of the ACT, and it is pretty difficult to argue against them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Chief Minister, Kate Carnell, has said that she solidly supports the federal government's economic agenda. We take that to mean that she solidly supports the federal government's cuts to the ACT economy. That is pretty much in line with the thousands of redundancies which she herself implemented in the ACT public sector. The consequences of that action can be seen immediately in youth unemployment. We exceeded 50 per cent youth unemployment late last year, and our rate has been consistently higher than the national average pretty much ever since the election of the conservative governments, federally and locally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a significant reduction in public sector employment; the flow&hyphen;on effects, as I have said, have been quite dramatic. There have been around 10,000 jobs affected locally. The federal coalition government has foreshadowed that there will be 16,500 public sector redundancies. In the first 18 months of this government, 30,000 jobs have been lost out of the public sector&mdash;and that is just in the first 18 months. There was an efficiency dividend under Labor over 13 years. But there is a big difference between an efficiency dividend over 13 years and the sorts of job cuts that this government has introduced in the public sector and their consequent flow-on effects to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economic growth in the ACT has fallen below the national average. Housing prices have dropped. New building approvals have reached their lowest point since the collection of statistics were begun. Unemployment has reached 8.2 per cent&mdash;one of the highest unemployment rates in the history of the territory. Child care has been hit particularly hard, which makes life very difficult for working families. And the honourable member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn), the previous speaker, claims that things in the ACT are just peachy. If he lived here, he would understand that things are very difficult, particularly for working families.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All other states and territories received an increase in general revenue funding from the Commonwealth in the last budget. If you add inflation to the equation, the ACT suffered a cut in real terms unlike that suffered by any other state or territory in Australia. Not only is the government unable to provide adequate resources for its own programs to resolve the ACT's unemployment crisis; it refuses to provide any additional provisions for the ACT in recompense for the cuts that it has made to the local area. To provide less money in last year's budget and a cut in real terms for the ACT when compared with funding for every other state and territory is a bit rich after you have applied the sorts of redundancies that we have had to sustain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the ACT asks for no special favours. We ask merely that we be treated equally with other states and territories, and that we not be maligned and abused by this government. The local ACT government has been complicit in the attacks that have been mounted upon the ACT by the federal government&mdash;or as summarised by coalition Senator Ian Campbell when he said that the ACT recession was `quite an achievement'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of those on this side of the House, particularly the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn) who has been making, I think, some very valid points in this debate&mdash;principally, of course, that this is a very cynical exercise being undertaken by the Labor opposition here in Parliament House to support and try to buttress its colleagues in the ACT Legislative Assembly. As they go to the ballot box in February, this is the last opportunity the federal Labor opposition will have to support them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has undertaken a number of very substantial initiatives which have been designed to improve the ACT economy: improvements that the previous Labor government, which had 13 years in office, failed to take up. I will highlight in my remarks this afternoon just some of those initiatives that have been undertaken by this coalition government&mdash;this Liberal&hyphen;National Party govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11639"> ment in Canberra&mdash;that are designed to boost the basic infrastructure and the basic economy of the ACT to enable it to evolve from a government dominated economy to a private sector dominated economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, I draw to the attention of the House the decision by this government to support the declaration of Canberra as an international airport. They had 13 years in government, 13 years of opportunity to determine that the Canberra airport could be made into an international airport, providing the ACT economy and the region that surrounds it with the opportunities that come from having a properly declared international airport in their midst. That international airport will create new opportunities, new economic activity, for the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also draw to the attention of the House the high speed train proposal, which was there in its origins throughout the Labor years, but which was denied by the Labor government. They put the kybosh on the high speed train proposal when it came forward in its original format and would not allow it to proceed. The federal Labor government would not give it the necessary encouragement and support that the high speed train proponents wanted and needed so desperately from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Upon entering office, this federal government went about as quickly as it could to ensure the facilitation of the aims and ambitions of a lot of people who live in this region to see a high speed train proposal not be just a proposal but actually come to fruition. That process, under the chairmanship of Mr Jim Servis, is well and truly on its way. We can see the economic opportunities of that proposal. It is a $1.5 to $2.5 billion proposal. It is a project that will have enormous ramifications for this district, and it is well under way under a coalition government. It was blocked by the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now see additional major infrastructure improvements in the region. For example, in 13 years of office the federal Labor government failed to bring the Federal Highway to four-lane dual carriageway standard. The previous government could have put the Sutton turn-off to the ACT border into Stirling Avenue into their five-year plan. When 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we came into office, it was not in the five-year plan. You will now find it in the five-year plan. Some $70 million worth of funds that the previous Labor government did not earmark for the ACT economy is now there for the current five-year plan that will go into the ACT economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the Murrumbateman bypass, which is an essential ingredient to the economy of Canberra. The Murrumbateman bypass is an enormous project of great economic value to the ACT. It was not in the previous Labor government's five-year program for road upgrading to the Federal Highway system. It is in the five-year plan brought forward by this coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to two other major road projects that will be of significance to the ACT economy. Trunk road 92 will be a main road servicing Canberra to the coast down to Nowra. It was denied by the previous Labor government. The planning for that project is now under way under this new coalition government. It is a huge project&mdash;$50 million&mdash;and will be of great advantage to the ACT economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to refer to Tumut Road, which runs through the Brindabellas to link into the busy craft mill that is proposed to be built in Tumut very shortly. Again, this is something which this government is prepared to countenance. It is actively working towards something of great value to the ACT economy in terms of generating extra revenue plus the money that is spent in the process of building it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

Everybody in Queanbeyan ought to hear what the member for Eden-Monaro has had to say about how good things have been for them since this government came in. I am obviously very concerned about the recession in the ACT and the region. The fact is that it has not been an accident; it has been a product of the conscious policy of this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Campbell's sin was when he said, `What a great achievement,' was not have to created a policy; it was to have exposed the policy. Everybody in Canberra already knew that that was the attitude of this government. It just took somebody to come out honestly and say so. The best story around Canberra is that the only bigger joke than Senator Campbell is the joke where people say, `What could be worse for Canberra than a Liberal government?' The answer is two Liberal governments. That is what we have at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that we make sure that that circumstance does not continue. The ACT government, instead of taking countervailing action to mitigate the consequences of the disastrous policies of this government on the people of the ACT and Queanbeyan, have made it worse. They campaigned for the election of this government, with its subsequent consequences on the ACT. We saw Kate Carnell campaigning for John Howard. He is the Prime Minister that she chose for the  people of Canberra, and the consequences have been disastrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government consciously set out to destroy jobs in Canberra and in the region, and they have succeeded. It is one of the few goals they have set which they have succeeded in. They have not done much for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> region either. The economy of this region is primarily dependent upon the Public Service and the private sector jobs that spin off it, upon the universities and upon information technology. They are three of the five major elements of the ACT and regional economy. All three of them have been disastrously affected by the policies of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an unexpected benefit from the excellent motion moved by the member for Namadgi that the member for Eden-Monaro has been flushed out to say that he thinks what is happening here is pretty good. The people of Queanbeyan have never had it so good. They should be pleased about the fact that the economy is in recession, that they are losing jobs, that it has had terrible consequences for all the businesses in the region. Their local member thinks it is wonderful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He does not see his role as an advocate for the region to the government; he sees his role as an advocate for the government to the region. That is a fundamental misunderstanding of his role, and it is a misunderstanding we will be very pleased to point out again and again to the electors of Eden-Monaro. I am surprised that we have had such an exposition of support for the policies of this government as they have impacted on the region. I am not surprised at the member for Hume, but I am very surprised that the member for Eden-Monaro should have exposed his weakness in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would any local member be proud that their government has caused housing prices to fall? Why would any member be proud that the government he supports has caused jobs to fall? They advocate how good their policies have been for the private sector. Why would anybody be proud that they have put bankruptcies up? The only things that have gone up under this ACT government are unemployment and bankruptcies. It has been bad for the ACT and for the region. The lives of tax paying, law abiding Australians and their families are being adversely affected. I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the motion by the member for Namadgi. It is very important that we make that clear.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I grieve for one of Australia's great industries&mdash;the gold industry. I grieve for the lamentable conduct of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for doing their best to damage the market sentiment for gold and for Australia's gold producers. Australia is the world's third largest gold producer and gold is our second biggest exporter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is not generally understood so far as the gold industry is concerned is that this is an industry within Australia which is highly regionalised. It is made up not just of large gold producers but a number of highly diverse smaller and medium size gold producers scattered throughout regional Western Australia, regional Queensland and regional New South Wales. So the economic consequences for regional Australia of damaging the market sentiment for gold are very high cost ones indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth relating to the House the history of this matter. We saw at the end of last week the gold price fall below $US300 for the first time since 1985. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister stand condemned for the way in which they have conducted themselves so far as the gold industry is concerned. We have seen in recent days the parlous state of Australia's gold industry throughout the financial and other pages of the nation's media: `Wave of fear as gold stocks battered again'; `Prospects dim for rig contractors'; `Gold hits 12-year low, sparking deficit fears'. These are the litany of sins for which the Treasurer and the Prime Minister hold their degree of culpability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The starting point for this was the RBA decision to sell 167 tonnes of gold on 4 July 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this year. That was a unique event because it was the first occasion on which a world-leading gold producer determined to sell gold. It was not so much the actions of the RBA but the actions of the Treasurer in the aftermath of the announcement of the decision to sell the gold which so severely damaged the sentiment for gold in the marketplace. When the Treasurer was interviewed on the morning of the announcement, he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why hold any gold at all? It's really only for the purposes of diversification. The Reserve's looked at its portfolio, it believes that there's a value in holding some gold reserves but not the gold reserves to the extent that it used to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the same interview, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gold producers are people that are producing for all sorts of levels, including international markets and there'll always be an international market for gold. People in international markets will want gold for decorative and jewellery purposes . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, standing there as the Treasurer of the Australian Commonwealth, he said to the market, `This is not an industry that we care about. This is not an industry that we have any sentiment for. This is not an industry that we need to hold in any way especial. This is not an industry which we regard as having any other role in life other than proceeding on the basis that there will always be an international market because people wear gold jewellery.' A couple of days later, on 9 July, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gold producers both in Australia and elsewhere, many of them have been themselves behaving in a way over recent months which has exerted downward pressure on the price of gold.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was code for what it precisely received on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> : `Miners to blame for gold crisis: PM'. Here the Treasurer is saying, `There'll always be a market for gold because people like wearing gold jewellery.' The Prime Minister is saying, `It's all the gold producers' fault.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A week or so after the event, the penny had finally dropped with the Treasurer. He was interviewed in Cairns on 10 July, and he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the gold industry, the gold industry in Australia is a very important industry. It's one that we value and we have confidence in the gold 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11642"> industry and we'd like to see it continue and I have no doubt that it will.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the following day, again in Cairns, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think I said yesterday that the Australian gold industry is a good industry. It is a good industry and the Australian gold industry will always be a world competitive industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a pity that he did not express these sentiments on the day of the announcement. Indeed, it is a pity that he did not express sentiments like this in the course of the six-month period when the sell-off was occurring without any publicity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Reserve Bank of Australia is charged with managing the announcement effects of interest rate increases or reductions, and for the one-off occasion that it had the job of managing the announcement effects of the sale of gold&mdash;Australia being the third largest producer in the world&mdash;the Treasurer comprehensively mucked it up and did such damage to the sentiment in the marketplace for Australian gold that we have now seen Australia's gold industry so very badly placed to cope with and cater for the fall in gold prices that we have seen continue from that day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I took the opportunity of raising some questions with the Governor of the Reserve Bank by correspondence after the Governor was interviewed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on this matter to try to clarify and ascertain the Treasurer's role. On 22 July, the Governor of the Reserve Bank wrote to me in response to my questions in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was the Bank's decision to sell the gold. It was the Treasurer's decision on how to dispose of the realised profits. The Reserve Bank Act specifies these separate responsibilities. In order for the Treasurer to make his decision, he had to be fully informed of what our proposals were. For this reason, consultation was necessary.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In making the decision on gold sales, both the national interest and possible implications for the gold mining industry were taken into account. These matters are not subject to credible quantification, even after the event.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The problem for the Treasurer and the Reserve Bank is that the Governor of the Reserve Bank has sprung the Treasurer. The Treasurer was fully aware of the potential adverse consequences for jobs, for regional 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia and for exports when he gave the green light.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Governor of the Reserve Bank wrote on 22 July that these things are not subject to credible quantification. The great tragedy now is that we see the credible quantification occurring day by day, the most recent example being the closure of the Mount Todd gold mine in the Northern Territory the week before last. The owners and managers of that mine made it crystal clear that one of the reasons for the closure of that mine was the adverse consequences caused by the RBA's decision and the government's handling of it. As Barry FitzGerald in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of today says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THERE won't be a present from the Australian gold industry under the Christmas tree for the federal Treasurer, Peter Costello, thanks to his over-the-top endorsement of the Reserve Bank's gold sell-off earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I raised the Mount Todd matter with the Prime Minister in question time on 18 November. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say to the member for Perth that the decision that was taken by the Reserve Bank of Australia to sell gold was fully in accord with well developed international practice in relation to gold.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What the Prime Minister did not appreciate at the time of the sell&hyphen;off or now is that Australia is in a qualitatively different position from other central banks who have sold gold. This is the first occasion on which a major gold producer has sold gold other than where the seller of gold is the official arm of that country's producer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are in a qualitatively different position from the sorts of examples which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have alluded to publicly or by way of correspondence. It is all well and good for Belgium to sell off gold, for the Netherlands to sell off gold and for the Swiss to sell off gold, but the difference between us and them is that they are either small or not producers at all and we are a substantial and significant gold producer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key difference that the Prime Minister fails to appreciate is that we are in a qualitatively different position and had to manage the sale of our gold, the green light having been given, in a much more assiduous way. It might actually have helped if, once the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11643"> Treasurer had given the green light, he was out there saying things which might have helped bolster the sentiment for gold in the Australian community. It might have helped if the government had said, `Well, we'll drop off our proposal to cap the diesel fuel rebate because we know how important that is to the international competitiveness of the gold industry and Australia's minerals and resources industry generally.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government might actually have said, `We might drop off the retrospective taxation of the sale of a prospector's right under section 23PA,' a decision announced by the Treasurer in the August 1996 budget. They might also have suggested to their Western Australian state colleagues that the imposition of a gold royalty was very badly timed. If it was a good idea, it certainly was not a good idea to occur in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Belatedly, on 18 November&mdash;the same day that I asked the Prime Minister the question that I referred to&mdash;we saw the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) issue a press release headed `New government moves to support gold industry'. Good old Warwick, loyal to a fault. The only problem is that he is about six or nine months too late. Senator Parer has effectively announced a series of measures to a talkfest to coincide with ABARE's annual Outlook Conference in February 1998. The measures which Minister Parer has outlined in his release of 18 November are all well and good. It is a pity that no-one bothered to consult the Minister for Resources and Energy in the run-up to the RBA's decision and the Treasurer's comment. He may have been in a position to edify the Treasurer and the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one important point to be made. One of the adverse consequences in the downturn of the gold industry will be the adverse consequences it has for exploration. In the most recent ABS statistics on private mineral exploration, which were released in September for the June quarter, the ABS says that the upward trend in exploration expenditure since the June quarter is made up of 62 per cent gold exploration activity. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS> </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pleasure to have 10 minutes to talk about my electorate. I do so in the context of the significant initiatives that the Howard&hyphen;Fischer coalition government has introduced since the election in March last year and how they relate to matters that have affected my electorate and some of the real advantages that have been delivered by those initiatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advent of communications as we march towards 2000 has enabled a changing face in regional Australia, one that this parliament must certainly take advantage of. Just as an example, my electorate was fortunate enough to get what is called a Department of Social Security teleservice centre, or call centre, which provided 100 new jobs. It went into the Central Highlands Water Building, which was underutilised. They are new jobs. Indeed, it is providing employment opportunities for rural and regional Victorians. There are a large number of people from both within Ballarat and the outlying areas of Ballarat who have been able to access this centre. It basically means that people in non-metropolitan Australia are able to take advantage of new communications technology which will deliver them jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting thing is the government's move to outsource some of its information technology. That has quite directly advantaged the IBM Geoplex complex in Ballarat. It is now one of the largest computer data storage facilities in the world. It not only brings jobs and infrastructure to Ballarat but also, in association with the Ballarat University, makes the region an educational and career magnet for information technology, meaning that young people can stay in our region, study and find employment in locally based industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a large amount of moneys in relation to the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund, otherwise known as Networking the Nation. I am very pleased that last week an announcement was made that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11644"> University of Ballarat and a group known as the Volunteers for Isolated Students Education have secured $150,000 to assist families and business in rural Australia to acquire the skills and confidence to access and utilise services and facilities available on the Internet. Networking the Nation will assist the economic and social development of regional, rural and remote Australia by funding projects which enhance telecommunications infrastructure and services, increase access and reduce disparities between urban and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, it is absolutely incumbent upon this parliament to ensure that non-metropolitan Australians are able to access the advantages that their metropolitan counterparts enjoy. We need to stop this appalling drift from regional and rural Australia to metropolitan areas, which has been going on now for some 20 years&mdash;unfortunately, greatly speeded up by the effects of the recession. I think that some people in the House today do not realise that areas such as mine, the electorate of Ballarat, the electorate of Bendigo and other surrounding electorates, actually went into recession well before their metropolitan counterparts. Indeed, we are struggling harder to get out of it, but I am pleased that the coalition government is at least making moves which will enhance our opportunities to drive job growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Natural Heritage Fund has put a considerable amount of money into my electorate. I am very proud that we have had several Green Corps programs, which are operated by the Ballarat based Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers, in my electorate&mdash;and all have been highly successful. The black spot program is a great initiative of the member for Hume, who has been mentioned several times today, which is providing safety to rural and regional Australians. Indeed, it was part of the program guidelines that at least 50 per cent of those funds go to regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work for the dole scheme has been very enthusiastically endorsed by my constituents in the electorate of Ballarat. There are now two projects where young people will start within the next week. They have been queuing up for this opportunity. I am pleased 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they have taken this opportunity. It reinforces my very strong view that people basically want a chance. I get very angry when I hear our young people being attacked for not being interested in working, in making their mark on our country's future. I believe they do. I believe they are ready, willing and able to do so; they just need the opportunities. They have enthusiastically endorsed the work for the dole program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just out of interest I jumped on my calculator the other day and in the last 18 months&mdash;just from the matters I could add up&mdash;some $52 million has gone into my electorate. I am not saying that that is to all new programs, but there are new initiatives, with which I am very proudly associated, which cover a range of things across the board, including marriage and relationship services, special jobs funding for disadvantaged young people and a new carer respite centre. Carers are the unsung heroes of Australia, with nearly two million carers in Australia. They are great people doing a marvellous job and they deserve every bit of support that they can get. We are still doing it tough in non-metropolitan Australia. This parliament must drive the opportunities for non-metropolitan Australia. I am very pleased that some of the initiatives we have put in place since coming into power have very much helped my constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to turn briefly to the 10-point plan. I want to give two quotes to put this whole debate into some sort of perspective. I have had a group demonstrating outside my office for the last five days. They are decent honourable people, most of whom I know well and have a great deal of respect for. But the point that needs to be made is that in 1993 when the Native Title Act was passed by this House and the Senate I did not have one single person knocking on my door to talk about pastoral leases. Not one single person came to me and said, `We are demonstrating out the front of your office because you have extinguished native title on pastoral leases.' Not one single person!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to put this into perspective, I will quote two people who made it quite clear that the effect of the Native Title Act was to extinguish native title on pastoral leases. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11645"> former Prime Minister Paul Keating said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> on 19 October 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I negotiated an agreement between the Aboriginal community and the National Farmers' Federation on the question of pastoral leases and, I think, with a very good outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What it will mean is that native title will be extinguished on pastoral leases&mdash;that is, not to the extent of any inconsistency but extinguished.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Probably the most telling, though, is a comment by Mr Noel Pearson on 10 November 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I rule out the possibility in Queensland of people pursuing any rights in relation to pastoral leases owned by non-Aboriginal people. I rule that out  categorically . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I plead with everyone in this House to read a letter from the Hon. Bill Hayden AC written to the Hon. Rob Borbidge on 21 March 1997. I am sure this man is a man of honour.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also met with residents. I presented petitions, on behalf of some 7,877 signatories, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to this chamber earlier in the year on different occasions. I have not seen an issue in my area where there has been such a strength of expression against a proposed action by a government as there has been with the opposition to the closure of Belmont Medicare office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I set out in a letter to the minister on 21 August all the factors that were involved. In this case, the Belmont Medicare office was moved from the Pacific Highway in July last year into Belmont Citi Centre, which is the major shopping centre. The new fit&hyphen;out costs of that location were borne by the landlord. The first year of occupancy was free. Almost as soon as the first year of occupancy was over&mdash;the free year of occupancy&mdash;the Health Insurance Commission then asked that the lease be waived. It is a great way to do business: they get a free fit-out worth tens of thousands of dollars and a free year's rent and then ask whether they can leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The turnover at the new premises was some 20 per cent up on the previous comparable location. The Belmont Medicare office has nice, easy access for people with disabilities. The nearest office for people who use the Belmont office is at Charlestown, some six kilometres to the north, or at Wyong, 49 kilometres to the south on the Pacific Highway. Accessing the Charlestown office is difficult. It is in a very large shopping centre&mdash;Charlestown Square. It is extremely difficult for people with disabilities to get to that office because of steps, grades and differing levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Belmont Medicare office has provided a superb service to my constituents in that area and people from the adjoining electorates of Charlton and Dobell. The decision to close the Medicare office, as so many of us know, has nothing whatsoever to do with the economics or the commercial results of the Medicare service. It has to do with dismantling Medicare. When the closure was first mooted, when the first leak came, we said at that time that this was the first step by this government towards dismantling Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It mirrors the action taken by the Fraser government. During the seven-year life of the Fraser government there were nine different 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11646"> health schemes, all aimed at maintaining what was then known as Medibank. Today's Medicare is a later version of what was then Medibank. Bit by bit the Fraser government dismantled it and it paid the price later, just as this government will pay the price. People dearly value Medicare. This government does not seem to understand that the people who use the cash claims offices of Medicare do so because they have to. In many parts of my electorate people go to the doctor, pay their bill, go straight to a Medicare office to get their cash refund and then go to the pharmacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medicare offices are located in the vicinity of health centres. They provide that service to people. It is not an option for people to go up to Charlestown or south to Charmhaven. It will cause disruption and inconvenience for those people. For people living near the empty purse level, every dollar and every cent counts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is simply the implementation of political ideology by this government. They hate Medicare, they hate community health services and they want to see an end to the Medicare service so they can have that service and those types of health services transferred to their friends in the private sector. For proof of that we have only to consider the utterances coming from the voluntary health insurance fund organisation from time to time. Remember the people in that organisation are the people who were on former Prime Minister Fraser's staff. Former Prime Minister Fraser's senior press secretary, Mr Russell Schneider, is the principal, and he has been there ever since he left the Fraser government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same is happening with this government. `We will maintain Medicare,' they said, but now they are proceeding to dismantle it finger by finger, hand by hand, a piece at a time&mdash;death by a thousand cuts&mdash;as they try to force people into private health care, into getting private medical treatment. The minister responded to my letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Closing Medicare offices is always a delicate decision. We need to be fair and reasonable in striking a balance across Australia between providing reasonable access to Medicare and the efficient use of taxpayer funds. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Is closing Medicare offices in low income areas being fair and reasonable? Is that the way we become efficient? We do have an efficient service. The turnover went up. Since the announcement of the possible closure of the office the turnover dipped down and it is now on the rise again because people are realising that the office is still open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not been told when the office will be closed. I am told the government has scheduled its closure for 27 March next year. But I say to the people I represent that we will do everything possible, through public utterances and public expression, to keep pressure on this government to prevent the closure of the office. This is an essential public health service, an essential public facility, that is vital not only to the business people of the area but to the residents of the area and sick Australians who need to go to doctors, who need to go to hospitals and who need to have pharmaceuticals. The minister then says it `was selected for closure after considering the criteria applied to all Medicare offices'. He says they look at:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> claiming patterns . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> cash service workloads&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Belmont has less than 400 daily cash claims&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> proximity to other Medicare offices (12 kilometres or less)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> leasing and other property issues&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which is obviously not relevant here. Those factors that are being looked at have nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that this is a successful service and is widely used. As I said, the almost 8,000 people who have put their names to petitions want that service carried on because they need it. There were no problems with the centre or its quality of service. It has been a very successful service with growing utilisation. We are really seeing the continuation of the government's attack upon Medicare and the system they inherited from Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to members of the government: do not think that you are going to get away with it. Each day that ticks by is a day closer to the election, and the closer that election comes the more these issues will take on increased 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11647"> importance, because people see the government for what it is. It promised to maintain Medicare, but it is now trying to abolish it by other means&mdash;by surreptitious means, by blaming other factors for its decision to close down services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to add to that the government's attempt to close down Medibank offices. There are 270 Medibank offices across Australia, most of them operating in Medicare offices. Those two services combine. There are economies of scale because of shared expenses. Those who want private health insurance have ready access to Medibank, although at the moment two out of three people in this country are happy with Medicare and do not subscribe to private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are economies of scale and benefits to be gained from co-location of both offices. If this government gets its way, only 70 Medibank offices will be left&mdash;that is, there will be 200 fewer Medibank outlets. The next thing we are going to hear from this government, if it gets away with that and the legislation gets through, is that Medibank really is not viable and that also ought to be handed back to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this afternoon in the grievance that I bring to the parliament I seek to enlist the support of all members to block the closure of Medicare offices across Australia by this government and to drive the message home to the government that these are essential services the community needs for the provision of the health care they use and for access to the pharmaceuticals they need for their illness. I ask the parliament to take that into consideration. Minister, I will be making further representations to you. I ask you, on behalf of the people I represent, to think again. This is a vital and important community health service that you are seeking to close. I ask you to keep that service operating. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="11647"><TITLE>Native Title</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance is one of great importance to this parliament and to the people of Australia. It is about how a debate can be distorted by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prejudice based on ignorance. For those who occupy this place, be they members of parliament, staff or media, there is no difficulty in getting hold of the issues that relate to the native title debate. The legislation is here, as are the explanatory memoranda and all the competing legal opinions, which, as I pointed out the other day, have only a 50 per cent chance of being right when one considers the performance of lawyers in court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today things took another step, and in two ways. This morning I heard Laurie Oakes on Channel Nine saying that any suggestion that freehold property could be attacked under the present native title arrangements was a lie because the High Court has said that this could not possibly occur. In an attempt to make that look even better, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) sought today to table a press release by Justice French of the National Native Title Tribunal. He, of course, would be an expert in all of this. He used to be a lawyer in Perth at one stage. I cannot remember anyone telling me in my commercial career, `You had better get lawyer French. He is the best in the state.' He was just another lawyer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst one can argue that the High Court has spoken on the issue of native title and those forms of title it extinguishes, that is not being supported by reality. Let me read to the House what the High Court said in this regard:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The personal rights conferred by common law native title do not constitute an estate or interest in the land itself. They are extinguished by an unqualified grant of an inconsistent estate in the land by the Crown, such as a grant in fee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">meaning in fee simple&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or a lease conferring the right to exclusive possession. They can also be terminated by other inconsistent dealings with the land by the Crown, such as appropriation, dedication or reservation for an inconsistent public purpose or use, in circumstances giving rise to third party rights or assumed acquiescence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You would say that is pretty clear, and that is everybody's argument. But I would like to bring to the attention of the House today examples within and nearby my electorate of freehold title, of residential exclusive leasehold, that presently not only are under native 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11648"> title claim but also are in the mediation stage. They have been registered by the National Native Title Tribunal. Justice French, who said `I would never do it' has done it. With the titles I am about to read from&mdash;I am prepared to table them if somebody wishes&mdash;I have the crown grants. The first was issued to Ray Bevan Willison and Lynette K. Willison. This is what it says on the bottom:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The abovementioned grantee is now the registered proprietor of an estate in fee simple in all the land described in this grant.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That sounds like freehold to me. These people by their own confirmation to me are currently in a mediation process with the National Native Title Tribunal. Just for the record&mdash;I might add that there are some 30 of these people in this situation&mdash;let me read from the crown grant to Dean Kenneth Morgan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The abovementioned grantee is now the registered proprietor of an estate in fee simple in all the land so described.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If that is not a piece of freehold, what is? Let me go on from that. There are 36 lots. I have the list here of all the people who are so affected. I hear the shadow minister on the other side saying, `There is a reason for this.' That is just what I want to get to.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How much more responsible can you be than to produce the documentation&mdash;the one thing you failed to do? I challenged you the other day. I said, `Come back in here and give proof of what you just said,' and you couldn't do it. Let us go to Exmouth. One of the arguments is that it does not matter when freehold was granted; from thereon there is an extinguishment. I want to come to that in terms of the Australian Capital Territory. The Western Australian government resumed land from pastoral leases and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> granted it in freehold in 1963 to the Commonwealth government. It became part of the defence establishment in Exmouth. On the retirement from that project by the Americans, the Commonwealth government gave that freehold back to the Western Australian government because it had houses on it&mdash;houses and Hills hoists, the sorts of things that we are told cannot be challenged under native title rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, these people turned around and bought these houses because part of the deal with the Commonwealth was that they would be sold off as freehold. That is interesting because a Labor state member, as the minister at the time, issued one of those freeholds. They are freeholds but they are under native title claim. That is the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We get to Kalgoorlie, and this is where it gets really interesting because the titles I have here are quite old and, as the evidence shows, some of them have been mortgaged and have changed hands over many years, but they are not freehold. They are long&hyphen;term, 99&hyphen;year residential leases but which clearly, as the High Court said, grant exclusive possession. You can find that out pretty easily&mdash;try and break in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that they are under registered native title claim. If they can be under registered native title claim, why cannot all the leases in Canberra? Someone just told me, `Oh, but they were freehold before they were leasehold,' but that is what applied in Exmouth. It also applied in Kojonup where a solider settler grant was arranged by the Western Australian state government many years ago after the Second World War. It bought freehold farm land and granted it to servicemen, not as freehold but as perpetual lease, because at the time that was way the government handed out all these soldier settlement grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only under native title claim. In fact, the lady concerned, Marion Wood, wrote to me explaining how she was called to mediation but when she got there&mdash;and she had driven a hundred&hyphen;plus miles from Kojonup to Albany&mdash;the lawyer for the Aboriginal interests said, `I am not ready yet. I am going to take another four months, so you can all go 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11649"> home.' That is another aspect of the present law. It puts an obligation on Mrs Wood, who has got her one&hyphen;time freehold property that is now under claim, to drive all that distance to negotiate in good faith over what she and her husband might do with that land in the future, but there is no such requirement in the Keating Native Title Act on the Aboriginal interests, and how are they dealing with that? Just like that. That is how they are treating decent people&mdash;people who did not go on to that land with a shotgun and a sword and drive the Aboriginal people off&mdash;who took up title after the war and were granted it in this format.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is exclusive, all right, and it is one of the titles that appears in our schedule, just as the one at Bremer Bay does&mdash;the original title that was subdivided there into freehold residential land was conditional&hyphen;purchase leases which are clearly granting exclusive possession of farm land and which would, according to the High Court, have removed and extinguished the native title. But you are finding all the time that people want to find chinks in the armour. It is a case of when is freehold freehold? You can bet that Slater and Gordon has got a little team of articled clerks working through every freehold title in Sydney and Melbourne, trying to find where someone made a technical mistake. That is why they are under challenge and, if anybody says that these documents are not real, they can bet with me. It will not be the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) who is betting with me because, when it comes to getting up and doing the right thing, he is a bit slow to get off the mark. You can bet me any amount you like if you want to tell me that these are not proper documents. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="11649"><TITLE>Parliament and the Executive</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the promises of the coalition government during the election campaign was to raise the standards of parliamentary activity and, in particular, to provide a greater opportunity for parliamentarians to use the forum to properly represent their constituents. Unfortunately, as is often the case&mdash;and quite clearly now in historical terms is ever the case&mdash;all we have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> seen is the basic expansion of the power of the executive vis-a&hyphen;vis the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is interesting because at one stage I was a chairman of the back bench committee in the coalition on Attorney-General and justice matters and I can recollect a number of members being quite rightly concerned at that time in opposition about the trammelling of the rights of parliamentarians by the executive. I suppose one of the most obvious aspects of that was the signing by Australia of treaties, instruments and agreements without recourse to the parliament&mdash;in fact, in instances where parliament would not even know and often neither would citizens unless they were taking the trouble to inform themselves, requiring a fair amount of research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that it was absolutely imperative, as far as members of this chamber are concerned, to ensure that the rights of members to represent the people who they have been elected to represent are upheld and that they are untrammelled. In fact, I can recollect the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia (Mr Costello) saying in his impressive maiden speech that, in the historic struggle between the parliament and the executive, he was for the parliament. But, in essence, we have seen with his role as the Treasurer basically more of the same sorts of tactics used by the previous government&mdash;in particular, the sorts of tactics that made the previous Keating government highly unpopular in the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People did not like the Keating government because they felt it was elitist, that it basically did not take any notice of the views of the general population and that it viewed the parliament's activities as a sort of sideshow, a pantomime where people would come on and have their little bit of say for five to 10 or 20 minutes and then pop off the stage, but no change to the decision making process would occur at all. In some instances, I am sure members would probably feel that they had completely wasted their time when it came to how much of an effect their participation in a particular debate had on the decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the new year we are going to see the Constitutional  Convention take place. It has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11650"> become known as the constitutional monarchical system versus an Australian republic when, in actual fact, the most serious problem affecting our constitution and our system of governments is not whether or not we are a constitutional monarchy or a republic but whether our system works to properly represent the interests of people. It is my view that it does not. In my view, it is basically a tyranny of the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of parliament, me included, like to come in here and make obvious efforts to change executive government as it moves inexorably towards its next decision. We find the opportunities are very limited indeed. Often the decisions are made long distances from here. As one representing a regional area, such as Western Australia&mdash;and, of course, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who is at the table, would know this as a member representing regional Queensland&mdash;it is even worse in our position because our geographical isolation from what is considered to be the centre of power and decision making in this country makes it even harder for us to have an active role in influencing not only the executive but the parliament, which is dominated by the numbers from Sydney and Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paddy O'Brien, a person for whom I have got a great deal of respect, has made the observation that Australia is already in essence a republic in model and that to all intents and purposes the argument over whether we should be a constitutional monarchy or republic is neither here nor there. What is in fact more important is to make the changes necessary to our constitution to make it more answerable to the people, to make it more accountable and to give the representatives of the people more influence on the decision making process&mdash;things like fixed term governments, opportunities for citizens' vetoes and citizens' referenda. Importantly, in view of more recent decisions by the High Court, we need a much clearer definition of the role of the High Court in our constitutional system. It is quite clear now that our High Court has taken upon itself a role that, in my view, was never envisaged when the Founding Fathers drew up our constitutional system. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> In actual fact, in more recent times it has gone not only far beyond the black letter of the law, the constitution but far beyond what most expectations of the High Court ever were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most odious aspects, in my view, of the executive tyranny is its capacity to make decisions on behalf of the community without recourse to the community. These are the sorts of secret deals and agreements made by small elites supposedly on behalf of the people of Australia. I would have thought that the coalition would fundamentally oppose this approach, given its philosophy and given some of the comments of members of that government in prior times&mdash;in particular the person who is now the Treasurer. We should have at least debate on these important matters and some sort of transparency of the deals into which the cabinet gets us. One of the hobbyhorses which I have ridden in more recent times has been the bailout of Thailand and Indonesia, and now with the crisis in South Korea there are the prospects of Australia participating in an international rescue of the South Korean economy and the South Korean won.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note an interesting article in the most recent edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine entitled `The IMF and Asia', which advises moderation from the IMF. It says in colloquial terms, in terms that a lot of people would understand, that when the South Koreans ring perhaps the IMF ought to hold off answering for a while, because it is clear that the IMF is now being seen as a lending bank of last resort, a sort of Rothwells Bank of the region, to use an unfortunate comparison. This is, in my view, having an adverse effect. The article identified that the size of the economies under threat in the early days of the trouble allowed many to ignore them. We in Australia, it seems, could not. Our government believes that we have become so intimately dependent on their success that not to fall in line and bail out these economies would be fundamentally damaging to our own national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This may be right, but the trouble is: who knows? Who has the knowledge or the information on which to base a rational decision? 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11651"> Not us in this chamber. We have not had one statement from the Treasurer, other than a couple of answers to questions. We had a private member's motion, which was given around 20 minutes to deal with what in essence was an extraordinary amount of money committed in the cases of the economies of Thailand and Indonesia. We need answers to questions like these: are we just putting good money after bad? Will the real sources of problems in these economies be dealt with to an extent which will stimulate the kind of growth we need to develop a healthy regional trading system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take the case of Malaysia. We have seen the Prime Minister of Malaysia off on an extraordinary tangent, an anti-Semitic tangent, where he claims that Jews and financial speculators are to blame for the Malaysian economy's woes. Then he says that there is a view that capitalism enslaves Asians. The Thais renege on some of the IMF conditions and nothing is done to make them comply. In the case of Mahathir, our own Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), far from actually condemning the comments made by Prime Minister Mahathir which were outrageous under any circumstances, in fact let it slide and said nothing. He was supine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is our government doing to ensure, firstly, that our resources being applied in these rescue packages will be secure and, secondly, that they will actually be effective? Who knows? Who would know? It certainly has not been made available to this chamber for debate. The two most common threads in the financial troubles in South&hyphen;East Asia have been described by commentators, including Alan Greenspan, as a lack of transparency in financial dealings and the level of corruption evident in many of the dealings of troubled financial sectors; and the level of Japanese financial support, through bad loans, to these failing economies. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Asia's economic problem is acute financial fragility. These are economies that have become accustomed to high rates of growth, an environment wonderfully forgiving of bank lending that is reckless or downright corrupt. . . . Most of the financial mess is of Asia's own making, and nowhere is this clearer than in South Korea. For years, the government has treated the banks as tools 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of state industrial policy, ordering them to make loans to non&hyphen;creditworthy companies and industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most significant of all, as events may prove, is to contend with a banking system which is rotten to the core. It is becoming clear that a decade of roaring economic growth concealed appallingly sloppy banking practices.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The crisis in Asia is a crisis of banking fiduciary responsibility, accountability and transparency of deals. Unfortunately, in dealing with these problems our own cabinet has chosen not to make it transparent. It has chosen to conceal the detail of these deals from the Australian population. It has chosen not to make statements to the Australian population about the true state of affairs, and in essence it is saying `Steady as she goes' at a time when some are commenting that the wash&hyphen;out from this crisis in Asia could well affect not only the Australian economy but also the world economy in such a significant way that people who are in the positions of making financial decisions on behalf of their companies and corporations ought to be in a position to know more about the true state of affairs rather than being given a pat answer by not only the Treasurer and cabinet but also unfortunately in this place by the government.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="11651"><TITLE>Drugs</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Initially, I wish to record that I applaud the stand of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his getting tough on drugs campaign and welcome the fact that at last a leader of this country has the courage and fortitude to make a stand on one of the most serious  challenges against the happiness and fulfilment of the lives of many young Australians. In making his strong stand, the Prime Minister is sending out a positive message to our young people to say no to drugs and is providing sound leadership for the youth of the nation at a time when young people often look for guidance from their elders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is in stark contrast to the useless, failed policy of harm minimisation that has been the government's policy since 1985, which begins with the premise that people are going to take drugs anyway so let us teach young Australians how to take drugs safely and hence minimise the harm drugs may

When the then federal Minister for the Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Peter Staples, opened the third international conference on drug related harm in Melbourne in March 1992, he strongly endorsed the harm reduction approach and came out in an extremely strong way to say that in his view there was no such hope as a drug free society. Strangely, as we have been able to observe over the last few years, this is not the policy used in the very successful anti-tobacco campaign, where total abstinence has been the platform in the full frontal attack in educating young Australians on the dangers of smoking tobacco.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As if anyone could smoke tobacco safely. How could any responsible adult even begin to suggest to young people that they can use illicit drugs in safety. My main focus today is to address the concerns expressed to me by many parents in my electorate of Hughes about the way in which the Australian print media has appeared to be biased against those who argue for a policy of total abstinence as a desirable aim in relation to the use of illicit drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my state of New South Wales, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> and Mr Alan Jones of Radio 2UE have had the courage to take a strong position against harm minimisation.

The parents of our young Australians may be interested to learn that in Washington DC in 1992 at the International Conference on Drug Policy Reform, Mr Bill Stronach, the then Executive Director of the Alcohol and Drug Foundation of Victoria, now the Australian Drug Foundation, made some interesting statements about the foundation's use of the media to change public opinion in favour of the foundation's policy of harm minimisation.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sources. One is the police. Another is alcohol and drug health agencies. But by far the overwhelming source of information which obviously is related to attitudes is the media. And we have focused, as an organisation, quite clearly strategically on the media.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He continued and made an alarming statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have employed journalists not to churn out press releases but to get in there as subversives and work with their colleagues in the mainstream press.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`Subversives' is the word he used. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and that's been done through developing, very slowly and very gently, a level of trust, a level of credibility. More importantly, the ability to respond because the press want instant answers and they want instant responses. So we have got 24 hours availability of those journalists. And what we're finding now is that in the last eight months, over 50 per cent of the mainstream print, radio and television reporting on alcohol and drug issues has now been generated by the foundation or has been filtered through it. And it's a wonderful opportunity when the press ring up, as they invariably do with some sensational story asking for comment, for us to talk often for an hour and try and turn that around and get the reporting perhaps presented in a different way, because we know that the nature of reporting that we have seen in the past has been sensational, it's been inaccurate, often dangerously inaccurate, and it's always, well not always, but by and large, focussed on those drugs which are illicit and their usage within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and the harm caused by them is minuscule compared to legal drugs. So we're having a significant impact there, I believe, and I think that's an exciting project. So the thrust of the foundation is to move via the media the public perception which we hope will move towards legislative change in the areas we would see as desirable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With the recent thrust in the print media this year from the drug law reformers who would like to see the decriminalisation of marijuana, heroin trials, shooting galleries and our young people maintained on the drug of their addiction without help or hope for any better future, you can see that this strategy has been very successful. As a parent, I am concerned with the comments by Mr Stronach in 1992 and with the prevailing public perception that has followed. I quote again from his reference in his speech to illicit drugs:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11653">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the harm caused by them is minuscule compared to legal drugs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Perhaps a lot has been learned about the dangers of illicit drugs since 1992. Perhaps today even the Mr Stronachs of the world are better informed. But this is a serious subject, and the taking of illicit drugs has such serious consequences for our children that the parents of Australia have a right to know exactly what illicit drugs can do to their children and their hope for happiness in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the public perception that the illicit drug marijuana, or cannabis, is soft, safe or even recreational. Nothing could be further from the truth. I quote from one of Australia's leading neuroscientists, John Anderson, Bachelor of Pharmacology, Diploma of Social Science, Master of Literature, MAPsS, consultant psychophysiologist at Neuroscience Psychological Services, Westmead, New South Wales, who tells us about marijuana:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the areas of the brain which are targeted by the drug are the hippocampus and the cerebellum, the former is concerned with relaying memory consolidation and the latter which controls equilibrium and coordination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people who use marijuana in their pre-teens and in their teens are at a great risk of progressing to being dependent on the drug and at a higher risk of using other illegal drugs. As tolerance develops and the drug no longer seems to give the buzz or it is no big deal, it is then just a small step onto the more spectacular drugs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What does it mean to have a juvenile stoned on pot? S. Cohen, before the US Senate hearings on the health consequences of marijuana use in 1990 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It means that they are losing learning time, growing up time, problem solving time, doing themselves a great disservice, remaining in a state of psychological immaturity, and never learning to cope with the difficulties of life. The professionals call this amotivational syndrome.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the `Health and Psychological Consequences of Cannabis Use', monograph 25, National Drug Strategy, Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health, Canberra, we were told in 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is sufficient evidence that indicates that cannabis use adversely effects adolescent development. Therefore, it is a desirable goal to discourage its use, especially regular use. While it is still true that peer pressure, curiosity and a feeling of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rebellion against the establishment contribute to marijuana's popularity, the single most important factor seems to be its intoxicating properties, the altered sense of reality that marijuana creates is pleasurable for some people. What is not known is the price these people may be paying for their pleasure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Teachers in our schools have observed the impact of marijuana use on their students. Vane Tempest, from Teachers Against Drug Abuse, Sutherland, New South Wales in 1994 observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students who are marijuana users are often tense, anxious, disruptive, restless, rowdy and given to daydreaming. They skip classes, do not submit easily to homework and try to avoid exams. Some are suspended from school. Others, who previously had good grades start failing or skipping classes as their drug use accelerates. Students who are users are often high before school starts and they tend to lose interest in all aspects of education.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If such threats to the physical health and wellbeing of our young people is not enough to raise the concern of parents, then the devastating effect of marijuana use on the minds of vulnerable young people would be sufficient to worry loving parents in the extreme. In 1982, Professor D.A. Milman of New York University, in his paper `The Psychological Effects of Cannabis in Adolescents', pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and feelings of depersonalisation and derealisation are not uncommon and are seen in acute intoxicated states as well as acute or chronic psychosis. It is believed that smoking marijuana may trigger an underlying psychosis.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A study in Sweden by Allebeck, Anderson and Rydberg reported in the Scandinavian <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal of Social Medicine</EMPHASIS>  1990 and in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lancet</EMPHASIS> , 26 December 1987, involving over 50,000 people found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . those who have used cannabis over 50 times have a risk factor of schizophrenia six times greater than non-users.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These researchers also found that the proportion of suicides increased sharply with the levels of cannabis consumption. In the American <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal of Diseases of Children</EMPHASIS> , volume 144, March 1990, researchers Berman and Schwartz noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Substance abuse has been found to be a significant risk factor in suicide attempts and completed suicides during adolescence. Marijuana and/or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11654"> hashish was 61 per cent of the drug of choice for abuse.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dr Juan Negrete, at the Second Paris Conference on Cannabis and Cocaine in 1992, warned that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. Clinical and epidemiological data suggest that cannabis could act as a trigger, prompting the overt expression of schizophrenia in individuals who suffer the basis of pathological anomalies. Therefore, despite the fact that schizophrenia may have a genetic basis, the use of marijuana triggers its onset.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are many issues surrounding the debate on appropriate drug policies, but throughout it all it seems to me that parents and young people are not given the full facts or unbiased information about the very real risks of taking illicit drugs, especially marijuana. The policy of harm minimisation sends very wrong messages to our young people that this stuff is not harmful and that, indeed, it is only recreational when it is the opposite that is true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I record my respect of and appreciation to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> and to Mr Alan Jones of Radio 2UE for their intellectual rigour and judgment, which proved tough enough to withstand the self&hyphen;professed seduction by the foundation to promote their misguided and failed policy. Very often they have provided the only other easily accessible source of information on this issue that has been available to the parents in my electorate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="11654"><TITLE>Greenhouse Gases</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is arguably no issue which is poised to embarrass and marginalise Australia more in the eyes of the international community than the Howard government's current stance on greenhouse gas emissions. In the eyes of our international partners&mdash;indeed, in the eyes of ordinary Australians&mdash;we are failing in our responsibilities as global citizens with the proposals the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) is taking to the negotiating table at the climate change conference in Kyoto this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, Australia has built up a well of international goodwill because of our principled and conscientious approach to pressing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matters of global importance. Now, faced with an issue which could not be classified as anything but globally significant, we are in the process of squandering that goodwill&mdash;and for what? There is not a single sound reason supporting the Howard government's position on greenhouse gases and climate change. It ignores the massive weight of evidence on this subject provided by the majority of scientific opinion. It reeks of expediency, of improper motives and of vested interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scientific model on which the Howard government's greenhouse position is based&mdash;a model developed and operated by ABARE&mdash;has been strongly criticised by more than 140 Australian economists for its inadequacies. US government experts, whose job is to provide their administration with a similar framework to analyse the pros and cons of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, say that ABARE's modelling completely overestimates the costs involved in strategies aimed at cutting emissions. It fails to assess any benefits from reducing greenhouse pollution, despite the fact that to do nothing, or close to nothing, could cost Australia close to $18 billion a year by 2030.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Alan Pears, the author of the federal government's own greenhouse handbook, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Global Warming, Cool It</EMPHASIS>, says ABARE's findings are `Alice in Wonderland stuff'. Dr Pears states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The devastation of the coal industry predicted by the economic models as an outcome of greenhouse response is much overstated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed, the New South Wales state government's Sustainable Energy Development Authority, or SEDA, makes a joke of ABARE's doom and gloom findings. SEDA and the New South Wales state government have stated that not only can New South Wales meet any likely target set by the climate change conference in Kyoto but also it can do so profitably, without the sacrifice of 90,000 jobs and without every person living in the state having $9,000 ripped out of their savings, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has attempted to scaremonger. And let us not forget that New South Wales is more reliant on coal production and coal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11655"> powered electricity than any other state in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps more damning of ABARE's findings is that its modelling has been so heavily patronised by the coal and oil industries, which stand to lose the most from any proposal advocating a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. So questionable is the role the fossil fuel industry has played in influencing ABARE's analysis that the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office is currently conducting an inquiry into the co&hyphen;funding arrangements which have seen ABARE invite private partners to join in the funding and the design of its work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever doubts there are about ABARE's modelling, it has proven successful in persuading the Prime Minister on this issue, as has the lobbying of Sir John Carrick and the head of the Prime Minister's local Liberal Party branch, Mr Robert Vincin. It was these two gentlemen who organised a grab bag of scientists and financiers to confront the Prime Minister and steer his position on greenhouse gas emissions to one which suited them and their vested interests. The success of Carrick and Vincin in convincing the Prime Minister over global warming paints a sorry picture of a leader who is more willing to listen to the sweet nothings of his friends than the cold hard facts. It speaks volumes that we now have a Prime Minister who is happy to listen to his political brothers in arms but who does not bother consulting the head of the CSIRO's Division of Atmospheric Research, Dr Graeme Pearman, when deciding on the nation's position on greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the Prime Minister, the vast majority of scientists are not as easily swayed by the arguments of the fossil fuel industry. The majority of scientists around the world agrees that the average temperature of the earth has increased 0.5 degrees Celsius since the last century and will continue to rise by between one and 3.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. Indeed, just last week the British Meteorological Office declared that 1997 will be the world's hottest year on record. It will be approximately 0.43 degrees Celsius warmer in 1997 than the long&hyphen;term average measured over the years 1961 to 1990. So far, the five warmest 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years on record have occurred in the 1990s. Based on the rate the world's temperature is accelerating, the earth is warming more quickly than at any time over the past 10,000 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Geoff Jenkins, who is head of the climate prediction program which made that discovery, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a good reason to suggest that part of this is due to human activity, for example emissions from power stations, and the evidence is building.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This latest evidence just adds to the mountain of proof we already have now at our fingertips. In 1995, 2,500 of the world's leading experts on climate change put their names to the second assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, which found that not only was the earth heating up but also man had a considerable case to answer for that increase in temperature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Chair of the IPCC, Professor Bert Bolin of Stockholm University, writing in the United Nations' environmental magazine, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our Planet</EMPHASIS>, had this to say about the recalcitrant scientists and countries which refuse to admit that global warming is a very serious reality&mdash;and it reflects badly on the line currently being pushed by the Howard government and its friends in the fossil fuel industry:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis of the criticism is meagre and sometimes simply scientifically incorrect. Some of these efforts stem from countries and groups whose economies depend in a major way on the continued use of fossil fuels, the source of much of the greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian people can also recognise what is at stake here. At the very least it is the damage to our international reputation; at worst it is that, by our reluctance to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to our fullest capacity, we provide other nations with an opportunity to follow our poor lead and to also not live up to their responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the latest <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> AC Neilsen&hyphen;McNair poll, 90 per cent of Australians are concerned or very concerned about the impact of global warming, 83 per cent believe that global warming is a serious threat to humans and the environment, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11656"> 79 per cent feel that Australia should join other developed nations in signing a treaty to cut greenhouse gas emissions and 68 per cent say that the Howard government's concern that a treaty will cause Australia to suffer economically should not stop it signing the treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Christopher Pearsons and Peter Walshes of this world argue that because Australia is not facing any sort of apocalypse&mdash;because the end of the world is not nigh&mdash;why should we bother about cutting our emissions? Why should anyone bother?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> They, along with a few others, have attempted to foster doubts in the minds of Australians that the issues of global warming and greenhouse gases are the equivalent of a scientific sideshow, and that there is no hard evidence to suggest man has had any influence on global temperature change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember hearing similar arguments from the tobacco industry when the medical establishment brought out the mountains of evidence linking lung cancer with smoking. Look at the immeasurable damage that has occurred because of that self&hyphen;serving and irresponsible denial which was circulated around the world. As journalist Brian Toohey noted in one of his recent articles on climate change `isolationism . . . is rarely a good option'&mdash;yet isolationism seems to dominate the Howard government's thinking on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's position ignores the one basic truth about the issue of greenhouse gases and global warming: Australia cannot isolate itself from the environmental fallout should we fail to play our part in reducing gas emissions and helping to control climate change. The basic truth is that we will all be affected by global warming, and it is from that truth that our policy should and must proceed. The fact that it does not means it will remain fundamentally flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, as well as future populations, will either celebrate or suffer from the effects of the decisions made in Kyoto this week. The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and the Howard government are strongly denying that there will be any effect on our environment by greenhouse gases, and that we in Australia do not cause any of that. I com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pletely deny his statements that the cost in jobs in cutting emissions has to be enormous.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I grieve this afternoon on behalf of a constituent, Mr Joe Friend, from The Channon, near Lismore. Mr Friend has a keen interest in the biological qualities of the neem tree. Neem is a tree species&mdash;its Latin name is Azadirachta indica&mdash;that has been planted in northern Australia since about 1940.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">References to the use of neem in this country are to be found in articles in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Mail</EMPHASIS> in 1882 and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Northern Star</EMPHASIS> in 1883, and the oldest known use of neem was for pest control in wheat. Neem leaf was reported to efficiently control the common wheat weevil of stored grain in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales. Neem products include neem cake, which is a valuable soil fertiliser, neem oil from the seeds and bark, neem leaf for certain insects and medicinals, and neem seed extracts for certain New&hyphen;Age botanical pesticides that are safer than pyrethrum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia there are at least six companies actively researching, exporting and importing neem products, and they grow neem trees right across northern Australia, from the Northern Rivers region to Perth. At least three companies dealing with neem products and their manufacture are located in the Lismore region, with two more in the Gold Coast and Brisbane districts.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other small businesses are directly connected to the wholesaling and retailing of neem trees to farms and farmers across the top half of Queensland and Western Australia, as well as the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After eight or nine years of considerable and deepening interest, as well as education of the public about the medicinal and pesticidal qualities of the neem tree, one would expect that federal authorities would be eager to foster and stimulate the further progress and development of new neem 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11657"> businesses arising in Australia. Sadly, to date this is the opposite of what has happened with our pharmaceutical and primary industry registration authorities in Canberra.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After over five years of attempts and trying times for Northern Rivers businesses, federal authorities&mdash;especially the National Registration Authority&mdash;remain almost intransigent in regard to registering neem products for use in Australian agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Registration simply has not occurred, and there appears to be no satisfactory reason why this is so. The National Registration Authority appears to have been advised that there are some potential public safety risks with neem products. However, no such risk has been stated by any toxicologist, and nil evidence has been furnished by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to attest to the alleged risk associated with neem products, if and where used in agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other side of the world, America is moving fast to take a good slice of the world's clean produce market. Neem&hyphen;clean pesticides, including the world's first fully registered neem extract for use in crops for human consumption, were registered on a priority basis back in 1992 and 1993. Here in Australia we have lost the chance to have the world's most environmentally sound pesticide placed into common usage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clean, non&hyphen;polluted farm produce is now in big demand in the Northern Hemisphere, and we could be helping to supply that demand. Without registered, certified, safe and effective farm chemicals like neem extract and, to some extent, neem oil, we will continue to fall behind in our ability to supply clean, quality assured, non&hyphen;polluted and chemical free foodstuffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the NRA and TGA authorities and bureaucrats in Canberra refuse to properly or professionally discuss the complex organic chemistry of the neem tree, and the products made from it, our country's economic future in this ethical direction is being put in jeopardy. To date, this problem has been going on for four or more years, and it does not look like going away, in spite of a lot of lobbying for change.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems appear to be many, varied and, to some extent, systemic in the nature of the way the NRA was set up in 1993-94 and with the close association that the NRA enjoys with its sister organisation in Canberra, the TGA. In summary form, the problems perceived to exist and co&hyphen;exist between the NRA and the TGA are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the TGA is supposed to provide independent toxicological advice to the NRA about chemical products being presented for registration by the NRA. However, because of the close, ongoing association, and regular dialogue between the NRA and TGA officials at various levels, there is no guaranteed independence of expert technical opinion that might be given by the TGA; that is, the TGA is not sufficiently independent of the NRA in order to be capable of providing an expert technical opinion that is professionally and totally independent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, to date, whereas the NRA approves for registration product labels without warnings for certain chemicals and indications against certain usages, such as malathion, for example&mdash;which is not supposed to be used anywhere near or on the skin of humans&mdash;the TGA has for years allowed the ongoing application of concentrated malathion to the skin of humans, and not just any humans but onto children's scalps. This is inconsistent and does not make a lot of sense. It certainly goes against the grain and the spirit of the federal government's supposed precautionary principle that this government agreed to put into practice and put its signature to at the Rio convention on the earth's environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there is the issue of policy and fast&hyphen;tracking. It is reported that the NRA has commenced to move faster with registrations and re&hyphen;registrations of numerous new and existing chemicals, some of them on a so-called fast&hyphen;track basis, according to reports received direct from officers working at the NRA. This in effect means that some chemicals are being fast&hyphen;tracked towards full registration and ultimate approval by Canberra, whilst others are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There appears to be no governing policy to allow this chemical discrimination to occur. In fact, one investigator reports that there 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11658"> appears to be no factual environmental policy in the NRA, so that chemicals which might have serious negative impacts on the environment are perhaps the ones getting fast&hyphen;tracked at present. Why? Because the NRA was set up to be a money raising organisation to pay for its own bureaucracy, which means that the more that certain corporations pay to have a chemical fast&hyphen;tracked, the more likely it is to get approved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This represents, by default, of course, a form of corruption that is creeping into the powers that be in Canberra. In this case, the NRA knows that they can get away with this form of rule bending since, in the recently determined and notorious Helix case of farm produce pollution by one such chemical, the High Court determined that the NRA was immune from any legal challenge or class action by public citizens or groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent example of one such chemical that has been carefully fast&hyphen;tracked for application to humans is ivermectin for the control of certain types of scabies in tropical Australia. Yet it is well known in the bush that this same complex organic chemical can and has killed prize bulls when applied as a `tickicide' on grazing properties. The NRA and TGA have ignored this vital local knowledge, no doubt in part because of a proclivity towards staying in office in their ivory towers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Friend believes that Australian soils deserve much better treatment than they are currently getting from the whole raft and swag of toxic synthetic chemicals now being put on and into the topsoil, once upon a time the domain of the world's greatest known microbiological diversity. Most chemical pesticides are acidifying in the way they work and break down; this means that our notoriously acid soils only get worse&mdash;more and more acid. This is wrong. On top of this, the sustained regular or repetitive use of foreign chemicals is almost certainly reducing the microbial biodiversity of our soils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Together, these comprise a borderline criminal situation that must be changed. In fact, neem products are scientifically proven to be safe and good for the soil environment&mdash;acidification is rectified, and soil 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> microbial biodiversity can be rebuilt. The NRA and the TGA have not realised any of this because neither organisation employs a soil scientist or anyone with vaguely similar qualifications. Australian soils are worse off as a result of this. In part, this is the result of the whittling away of the CSIRO through the entire same period of NRA's rise to ascendancy. Yet, when the NRA came into being, we all expected better than we got. It seems that all we got instead was more of the same&mdash;like a roll-out from the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In spite of the good intentions of some grassroots environmental activists via the community consultative committee to the NRA, there has been nil fundamental change to the status quo supporting large multinational chemical companies in this country. They still go on distributing ever more new chemicals, and not being stimulated to look for viable, safer alternatives to the old poisons of yesteryear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business that is proudly looking towards a brighter, safer future for our polluted environment is not getting a decent go in this country. New Australian businesses have been trying to get ahead with neem products, but all they seem to get from Canberra authorities is a very plain set of excuses for continuing to favour the bigger offshore companies that can afford to support the NRA in the style to which it has become accustomed. One company from Lismore applied to register its neem pesticide product in 1994, but it was knocked back by the NRA, in league with the TGA.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my duty to make a short statement to the House concerning the Senate proposals with respect to this bill, and the matters of constitutional principle that they raise. It appears that proposed changes (5) and (8) will, if enacted, have the effect of increasing the expenditure under the standing appropriation in the principal act. Purported amendments (2) to (4), (6) and (7) and (9) are consequential to (5) and (8). The change proposed by the Senate, which is numbered (12), with (1), which is consequential, would create a discretionary power to increase 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11660"> expenditure under a standing appropriation. The increase would be a legally possible,  probable and expected increase in expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is significant doubt that the Senate may proceed in such circumstances by way of amendment because of the requirements of section 53 of the constitution. A more appropriate way to proceed would be by way of a request for amendment. However, the purported amendments raise an additional important point of constitutional principle. Section 56 of the constitution provides that a vote, resolution or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue shall not be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of the Governor&hyphen;General to the house in which the proposal originated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">House standing orders 297 and 298 are complementary to section 56, and provide for messages from the Governor&hyphen;General recommending an appropriation for the purposes of, or in relation to, amendments or requests to be announced before the amendment is moved or considered. It is my belief that certain of the purported amendments would increase expenditure under the appropriation, as I noted earlier. My belief is supported by legal opinion. No message has been reported in respect of the purported Senate amendments. In fact, a message could not be reported relating to a Senate amendment&mdash;only for Senate requests for amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of this, the matter for consideration becomes not so much the privileges and rights as between the two houses but observance of the requirements of the constitution concerning the appropriation of revenue. Where there is a possibility of certain sections of the constitution being considered to be matters on which courts might not make a pronouncement, there is an obligation on all involved in the parliamentary process to ensure that constitutional propriety is observed. Of course, it is for the House itself to decide what action to take in respect of the matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the important statement that you have made to the House today. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House endorses the statement of the Speaker in relation to the constitutional questions raised by message No. 341 transmitted by the Senate in relation to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R254">Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill 1997</XREF> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that the Senate has purported to make fall into three groups. The first group is the assets test amendments. Amendments (1) and (12) relate to the exemption of certain superannuation investments from the social security assets test. Amendment (12) provides further scope for exempting such investments, which will both expand the class of people entitled to social security benefits and increase the benefits payable to some existing recipients. Amendment (1) is consequential to amendment (12).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second group is the family payment amendments. Amendments (2) to (9) relate to entitlements to family payments for children who are overseas. Amendments (5) and (8) narrow the circumstances in which family payments will be reduced because children are overseas, thus increasing the class of people who will continue to receive family payments at higher rates. Amendments (2) to (4), (6), (7) and (9) are consequential upon amendments (5) and (8).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third group is the rent assistance amendments. Amendments (10) and (11) relate to the rent assistance entitlements of people who are paying government rent. The bill would reduce the class of tenants who are entitled to rent assistance and the amendments would expand the class, although the class would still remain smaller than the class of people who are currently entitled to rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney-General's Department has advised that amendments (5), (8) and (12) should have been moved in the Senate as requests, and require the Governor-General's messages in accordance with section 56 of the constitution. On several occasions in the recent past, the Senate has passed amendments which, in the view of the government, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11661"> should have been moved as requests for amendments in accordance with the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the belief that the requirements of section 53 are matters to be negotiated between the two houses and to avoid delaying the business of the parliament with procedural debates, the House has commonly accepted the Senate's amendments in such cases, although the House's views have often been expressed from the chair. However, in this case, we are dealing with different matters. The government's advice on this bill is not only that the amendments should have been moved in the Senate as requests for amendments but also that the amendments concerned should not have been made at all before the House was informed of the Governor-General's message recommending the purpose of the necessary appropriations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's view is that the section 56 requirement for the Governor-General's message cannot be dismissed as a mere procedural matter. It is fundamental to the preservation of the financial initiative of the executive government. Accordingly, even though we will be accepting all the changes contained in the Senate amendments, we will move that the House reject Senate amendments (5), (8) and (12)&mdash;which were made without a Governor-General's message&mdash;and the amendments consequential to those amendments on the grounds that they should have been moved as requests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House will then receive the Governor-General's message, and we will move amendments to the bill in identical terms to those rejected in the Senate form. If these amendments are passed, the bill will be returned to the Senate in the form sought by the Senate. We would expect that the Senate would then agree to the bill.</PARA>

First was an amendment requested by the government to give the Minister for Social Security a broader discretion to exempt on hardship grounds holders of superannuation assets from the operations of the assets test. The minister already has a broad discretion under the income test but not the assets test. This amendment removes that anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, the government inherited a Social Security Act which denied more than the minimum family payment to a child going overseas even for an operation or a school trip.

We balanced this by bringing back the amount of time parents could be overseas from 13 weeks to eight weeks. The Senate amended this fair compromise by giving both children and parents up to 13 weeks overseas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to amendment No. 10, the opposition is pleased that the government is accepting our amendment on this matter. It is important to draw the attention of the House to the substance of the amendment. We are not seeking to enable anybody to get a double subsidy, as I am sure the minister is aware. It is very important that that not happen. As the minister has indicated to the House, the government does not have any idea how many people are in the category of being subletters in public housing. When questions were asked in Senate estimates about the government's knowledge of this matter, no information was forthcoming. So it is very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11663"> important that we understand the nature of the problem before enacting significant changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case that, if this measure had gone ahead, families could have been disadvantaged. Where people who collect rent assistance notify, probably through their parents, the state housing authorities that they are in  receipt of rent assistance, it could be that subsequent to that their parents' rent would go up. The government needs to provide evidence of the existence of a double subsidy before asserting it and trying to bring in changes to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we are pleased that the government has accepted the opposition's amendments. Already people in public housing are doing it very hard as a result of a number of changes this government has already introduced. We know that, under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, there have been significant cuts in the last budget to the building of new public housing around Australia. We also know that people in public housing are facing a considerable period of uncertainty because this government is unable to negotiate a new Commonwealth-state housing agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the government came to power, it has had no success whatsoever in negotiating a new Commonwealth-state housing agreement. This is putting enormous pressure and uncertainty on people in public housing. At least this small measure will relieve that uncertainty to some degree. What we would hope to see, however, is the government taking swift action to get a new Commonwealth-state housing agreement negotiated so that the states can get on with building the houses that are much needed and so that those who need to live in public housing can have the security of knowing that housing will be there when they need it.</PARA>

The Senate agreed to amendments moved jointly by the opposition and the Australian Democrats to oppose the six-month limitation period and so maintain a 12-month period. The government still considers that a six-month period is reasonable for arrears of child disability allowance claims. However, in the interests of securing the passage of this bill and the important measures contained in it, the government will reluctantly maintain the current 12&hyphen;month arrears period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 4 of the parenting bill provides for the application of consistent hardship rules to ordinary waiting periods, the liquid assets waiting period and the income maintenance period. The key concept in these hardship rules is the requirement that, before the waiting periods may be waived, the person must be in severe financial hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the reason why the person is in such hardship is that the person was forced to undertake unavoidable and essential expenditure. The Democrats moved amendments to schedule 4 in the Senate to the effect that the phrase `unavoidable and essential' was replaced with `unavoidable or reasonable' expenditure. These amendments were unanimously accepted by the Senate. The government recommends that the House agree to the amendments proposed by the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

Members might recall that the government has already tried to reduce the arrears period once and had to accept the opposition's amendment on that occasion as well. They tried to reduce the arrears period from 12 months to three months last year. That was defeated. The government came back again to try to reduce it from 12 months to six months. It has been defeated again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us hope that the government realises that the reason the arrears period keeps getting defeated is because the opposition is very concerned that parents do take a considerable period of time to come to terms with the fact that they have a child with a disability and all the extra work and responsibility that that entails. In addition, there is the time taken to actually have the child assessed and diagnosed. To expect the parents in that situation to get it all done in three months, as was the government's original intention, or in six months, was unreasonable as far as Labor was concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very pleased to see the government accepting those amendments. I hope we will not have to have this debate for a third time. I hope that the government recognises that parents who have children with disabilities are under enormous pressure and do not need to be put under more pressure than they have already been put under by this government. It is not only the child disability allowance that is putting parents who have children with disabilities under pressure; there are major changes to the new mobility allowance rules which mean that people with disabilities are finding it harder to engage in training and day activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We still have a government that is unable to negotiate a new Commonwealth-state disability agreement. In fact, Commonwealth and state ministers met again on Friday and were yet again unable to come to any agreement about a Commonwealth-state disability agreement. The reason they cannot come to any agreement is because this government has only one objective, which is to cut the funding to people with disabilities. The government is continuing the Commonwealth-state disability agreement on a month&hyphen;by&hyphen;month 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agreement. This is putting people with disabilities and families with children who have disabilities at considerable risk because they do not know whether the services that they need will be available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made a decent change here in this social security legislation to recognise the need for parents to be able to claim their child disability allowance 12 months in arrears. I would also say to them that young people and other people needing to get to training and day activities also need a mobility allowance. Everybody who has a disability needs to have some certainty. The government should act immediately to negotiate with the states a new Commonwealth-state disability allowance. That might then end the raft of bad news that this country has had from the Howard government's approach to people with disabilities.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle of the low income exemption threshold was incorporated in the original Medicare levy package way back in 1984 and is designed to ensure that low income individuals and families are not liable to pay the Medicare levy. The measures contained in this bill merely seek to increase the threshold by amounts in line with increases in the consumer price index with the new threshold amounts coming into effect in the 1997-98 financial year. It is interesting to note that the government is prepared to adjust this threshold to better align it with the CPI, given its reluctance to do the same with the provisional tax uplift factor. Such are the vagaries of contemporary political life, I suppose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exemption of low income earners from the Medicare levy is both fair and reasonable. However, it is pertinent that the increases proposed in this bill be seen in the context of the overall increases in the costs of our public health care system. While the increases in the low income threshold are modest, there is nothing conservative about the growth in total health care outlays, which far exceeds movements in the CPI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to release of the government's publication entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Statements of the Commonwealth Government of Australia for the year ending 30 June 1996</EMPHASIS>, the most reliable information from the Department of Finance showed that the Medicare levy would raise $3.4 billion in the year 1995-96. Compare this with a total national health bill of more than $18 billion in the same period and it becomes glaringly obvious that the Medicare levy goes nowhere near meeting the real costs of our health care programs and systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total dearth of transparency in the cost of Medicare should be of concern to all in this place. During the debate on the Medicare 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Levy Amendment Bill 1996, I proposed that taxpayers should be made aware of their real contribution to the nation's Medicare bill. I specifically used the word `real' because, in the wider community, the perception persists that the Medicare levy reflects the true cost of Medicare outlays and expenditures. As I have previously demonstrated, there is absolutely no parity between the two. It is no wonder, then, that the Productivity Commission, in its 1997 report into Australian health care, variously described the system as `disparate' and `poorly coordinated'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, I have referred to the mentality amongst many taxpayers that either because the Medicare levy is compulsory it is all the individuals need to pay to provide for the cost of their health care or because the amount of money conscripted by way of the levy is perceived to be so high there need be no further contributions by individuals to the cost of their personal health care. The fact is that the government must take a hard-nosed response to redressing the imbalance between revenue and outlays on health and increase the Medicare levy to a level commensurate with either total health expenditure or, at the very least, to the extent necessary to pay the cost of Medicare. Of course, such an increase should be accompanied by a compensating decrease in the marginal income tax rates so that the aggregate tax take is preserved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than adopting policies and practices which would facilitate a better understanding of the health funding crisis that lies in wait, the coalition has actually exacerbated the problem by failing to differentiate the Medicare levy in recent fiscal papers. I think it is appropriate at this time to seek leave to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a table which I have taken the precaution of circulating widely.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already referred to the release of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Statements of the Commonwealth Government of Australia for the year ending 30 June 1996</EMPHASIS> . Prior to the release of that document, it was standard procedure to show separately the revenue raised by way of the Medicare levy as a distinct part of the total tax take from the full range of taxation measures. Suddenly, though, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Medicare levy is no longer identified on the federal balance sheet and has instead been lumped in with overall individual tax figures. In August 1995, the magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Personal Investment</EMPHASIS>  proposed that&mdash;and it is not my language; I am quoting:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only way Medicare's costs can be controlled in the larger term is to make each individual a little more responsible for their longer term own health costs. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11691">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">While medical and tax experts agree that consumers require a greater appreciation of the shortfall that exists between revenue raised by way of the Medicare levy and actual national health costs, the government has made it more difficult to get this message across. The Australian people should be made aware of the lack of symmetry between the Medicare levy and the costs to taxpayers of pharmaceuticals, doctors and hospitals. Now, however, there is absolutely no way of calculating the total estimated revenue raised from the Medicare levy for the year 1996-97 from the recent Department of Finance figures. That is totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello) was supposedly all for open and transparent account keeping when he introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996  into this place only last year. It appears that he is now nonplussed about ensuring that the government meets the very standards it claims to have set for itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will see the Medicare levy low incomes threshold increase to $13,389 for individuals and to $22,594 for couples and sole parents in the 1997-98 year. Accordingly, anyone who receives a full single aged pension of $347.80 a fortnight or those aged pensioner couples getting the full combined amount of $580.20 are exempt from paying the Medicare levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Official data demonstrates that one of the most significant trends emerging in Australian demographics is the increase in the size and the proportion of the elderly population. Our aging population is expected to have a devastating effect on our national health care programs. Contributing to this effect is the fact that the number of aged persons who will be exempt from paying the Medicare levy will increase disproportionately over the coming decades. In its current format, Medicare is reliant on the taxpayer to provide a lot of the revenue needed for its survival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, with our population aging, there will be fewer participants in the paid work force relative to the growing number of retirees. The Institute of Family Studies found that, by the year 2041, 36 senior citizens and 29 children will be dependent on every 100 persons of work force age&mdash;that is, 35 per 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cent of our future population will bear the responsibility for the care of the remaining 65 per cent unless measures are taken pretty soon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite various attempts to increase the level of national savings, our household savings as a percentage of disposable income have declined significantly during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1979 Australia's household savings rate sat at 12.3 per cent of total disposable income, which placed us in 12th position in comparison with 20 other OECD nations. By 1996 our household savings rate had diminished to only 4.2 per cent of disposable income, and we had dropped down to 17th on the OECD table. In other words, a growing number of Australians remain indifferent to providing for themselves in retirement and for their health care costs and are instead content to rely on a taxpayer funded pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coupled with this is the corresponding decrease in the number of Australians who are taking out and maintaining private health insurance. As was highlighted in the August 1995 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Personal Investment</EMPHASIS>, Medicare was originally intended to `co&hyphen;exist' with private health insurance, with the latter acting as a kind of relief valve for Medicare. What has developed of course is very different. Whereas 50 per cent of Australians were covered by some form of private health cover in 1984, only one in three are now privately insured. As a result, the Commonwealth and states now fund 80 per cent of the expenditure on medical services and public hospitals, while private health insurance now accounts for only 11 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995 the elderly accounted for approximately one-third of our national expenditure on health care, but it is expected that this figure will climb to more than 50 per cent within the next 50 years. Our aging population means that a greater proportion of older Australians will place greater demands on Medicare in future&mdash;particularly if the drop in private health insurance is not reversed&mdash;and that this increase in costs will have to be met by fewer working taxpaying Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, as the number of older Australians who will be reliant on an age pension and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11692"> therefore exempt from paying the Medicare levy increases in future, the tax base required to support Medicare will continue to shrink. The Australian Institute of Family Studies, in its 1997 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Family Profiles</EMPHASIS>, noted that the number of people aged 65 years and over is projected to more than double, from 2.15 million in 1995 to 5.48 million in the year 2041.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As at June 1997, Department of Social Security and Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed that, of the 2.48 million Australians over the age of 65, only 500,000 of them are self&hyphen;funded retirees. Put another way, fewer than one in four retired Australians are not reliant on a publicly funded pension at present. If this trend continues, more than four million aged Australians will be exempt from paying the Medicare levy by the year 2041.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the number of people who are not obliged to pay the Medicare levy is actually much higher than this because persons receiving a full sole parent pension also qualify for exemption from the levy. In 1995 just under 325,000 people were in receipt of the sole parent pension. This number is expected to climb owing to an increasing divorce rate and an increase in the number of women who have children while never having been married.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While these low income earners should continue to be exempt from paying the Medicare levy, it is critical that the exemption be seen as part of the overall problem of funding our public health care system. Treasury has estimated that the cost to revenue to increase the threshold as proposed in this bill is $74 million over the next four years. That is a substantial cost to the taxpayer and one which can only increase in the coming years. Continuous debt accumulation, which future generations will have to pay off, is an issue of such importance that it needs to be tackled in a realistic fashion and in the immediate future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the more perplexing aspects of the Medicare levy exemption threshold is its interaction with the newly created Medicare levy surcharge. Members will know that the latter was announced by the government in its 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1996-97 budget and sees an additional one per cent Medicare surcharge for individuals earning in excess of $50,000 per annum and couples and families with a combined taxable income in excess of $100,000 if they do not have private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill seeks to amend sections 8D and 8G of the act to raise the threshold to exempt a family member with low income from liability for the Medicare levy surcharge. For instance, in the case where one member of a couple earns $13,000 per annum and the other member earns $88,000 per annum, hence providing a combined income of just above the surcharge exemption threshold of $100,000 per annum, only the latter will be liable to pay the additional one per cent levy surcharge if he or she does not have private health insurance. The former will be exempt from paying the Medicare levy surcharge as well as the Medicare levy because his or her income falls below the new Medicare levy threshold amount of $13,389 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sole purpose in providing a Medicare levy exemption threshold is to benefit low income individuals and families. It seems to me that a shortcoming of the principal act is that it allows someone to benefit from the non-payment of the Medicare levy because his or her earnings fall below the threshold amount even though the combined family income may be in excess of $100,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is right and reasonable to expect that those who can afford to pay for their own health care, including making a contribution to the Medicare levy, should be expected to do so. As one analyst recently noted, there is simply no sustainable solution that does not involve people who can afford to do so paying more of their own health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally perplexing is the manner in which the interaction between the two Medicare levies is clarified&mdash;although I use the word `clarified' rather loosely&mdash;in the explanatory memorandum. What is the point of having an explanatory memorandum if it fails to explain in lay terms the specific amendments being sought in the legislation? There is absolutely nothing plain or intelligible in the section of the explanatory memorandum that deals with the correlation between the Medicare levy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11693"> exemption threshold and the Medicare levy surcharge exemption threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is supposedly committed to the tax law improvement project. It has opted to continue funding the project, which has cost more than $4 million already and countless man hours, the end result being a supposedly more simple and straightforward reading tax act. If the current rate of progress is anything to go by, it will be another 25 to 30 years before the rewrite is complete, and that does not take into account the time that will be necessary to simplify the complicated language in the accompanying memorandum to this bill. In commenting on the complex nature of recent amendments to the capital gains tax rollover, the President of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, Mr Graeme Samuel, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why does the Tax Office invest millions of dollars in a tax law improvement project if it cannot staunch the flow of legislative gobbledegook in one particular amendment?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The same question could be asked in this instance. Australia is not alone in spending an increasingly large share of its gross domestic product on health care. The United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, West Germany and a host of other nations are currently facing similar cost problems. As in Australia, the health system in each of those countries is characterised by the increasing inability or, more accurately, unwillingness of consumers to pay for so much expensive health care, according to a report recently produced by the Institute of American Universities. The critical first step in controlling expenditure in health care is to make the community better aware of the true cost involved. A better aligned Medicare levy is essential to achieving that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was enjoying the speech of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). It is a pity that he did not have a little more time to finish.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member talked about the explanatory memorandum. I have often wondered whether that was a misdescription of these documents.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe it is something of a literacy test. In any case, I am referring to the explanatory memorandum to this legislation, which deals with a number of matters. As the member for Curtin also said, being critical, I suppose, of the government&mdash;but I am sure it is criticism that is recognised&mdash;we do have an enormously complex tax system. This legislation just adds to the thousands of pages of tax legislation and creates work for accountants trying to understand them. That underlines the need for reform of our tax system. That is a process upon which the government has embarked and about which I want to make a few comments later on in my contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly interested in the issue of fringe benefits tax. This legislation deals with some changes to the fringe benefits tax regime. I do not suppose there was ever a more controversial tax introduced in Australia. I recall the debate that went on at the time it was introduced. The tax was resented by the business community, and by the small business community in particular because they ended up having to collect the tax. Although in theory at least fringe benefits of the sort covered by the regime were taxable, the fact was that the tax was easily avoided. In the end the decision was taken by the former government in bringing in this tax that its incidence should be upon employers rather than employees. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not necessarily agree 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11694"> to this day that that was the correct way to go. However, now the tax collects many millions&mdash;perhaps even billions&mdash;of dollars and, therefore, I do not think any government is going to want to change that to any great extent. There are, nevertheless, in this legislation some significant changes. This legislation picks up some of the recommendations of the report of the small business deregulation task force, brought down in November 1996. That task force was chaired by Mr Charlie Bell, who is the managing director of McDonald's Australia. He had on his committee a number of prominent business people and accountants. The report was welcomed. It certainly was a very worthwhile report from the government's point of view. It brought down a number of recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer briefly to the beginning of the key finding of that report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The small business community is frustrated and overwhelmed by the complexity, and cost of dealing with government regulation and paperwork. Small businesses often do not understand their compliance obligations and have an underlying fear of penalties from doing the wrong thing. The Commonwealth Government, its departments and agencies must implement a broad and sustained program of action to reduce the burden and give small business operators more time to operate and grow their enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There needs to be a substantial change in the culture of government. Governments must remove unnecessary regulation and improve the quality of administration. Proposed regulation needs careful scrutiny to ensure the burden on small business is minimised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Departments and agencies responsible for regulation must monitor the impact of their paperwork and compliance requirements on small business and report annually on their progress in reducing the burden.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it was in that context that this report went on to make a number of recommendations about the taxation system. As I say, the legislation that we are dealing with today deals with some of those recommendations, which the government is delivering on in the legislative sense. Dealing with taxation, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Difficulties with the taxation system were the most important issues small business raised with the Task Force. The system is too complex in terms of the number of taxes, the uncertainty of the law, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the frequency of changes,  the difficulty of interpretation, the burden of record keeping and the costs of compliance . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is quite a list. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small businesses want simplicity and certainty in taxation matters. They see minor inequities being more than compensated by savings in record&hyphen;keeping, accounting fees, time and anxiety.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report then deals with the fringe benefits tax. This is really the pertinent feature of this report in the context of this legislation. The report observes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many in small business, the fringe benefits tax (FBT) represents the worst aspects of the taxation system. It is difficult to understand and compliance is costly. Those compliance costs are [a] dead weight loss for small business and the economy generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To reduce the complexity, compliance costs and paperwork associated with FBT the Task Force recommends it should be amended to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* introduce a simplified valuation formula for motor vehicles;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* exempt meals from FBT and introduce a simplified formula for assessing the deductibility of meal expenses under the Income Tax Assessment Act;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* exempt car parking and taxi travel from FBT;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* align the FBT year with the income tax year at 30 June, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* change the so called arranger provisions so that the onus of paying FBT lies with the supplier of the benefit.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government responded to the report on 24 March 1997. As I recall, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) spoke in the parliament at that time. His response was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS> , which seems like an appropriate response to the original report which was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for business</EMPHASIS> &mdash;I take it that somebody spent some time thinking about an appropriate name for the Prime Minister's report&mdash;and it dealt with the question of FBT. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with simplifying the arrangements for employee taxi travel by extending the existing FBT exemption to cover a taxi trip arriving at or leaving from the place of work at any time of the day with effect from 1 April 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to implement a number of the changes. In fact, if you refer to the explanatory memorandum for the legislation, you will see it makes the point that we are actually implementing the recommendations of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11695"> Bell task force in extending and simplifying the existing exemption for taxi travel, exempting car parking benefits provided by certain small businesses unless the car parking is provided in commercial car parks and simplifying the arranger provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the government has accepted those recommendations of the Bell report. I recall that a couple of years ago when I was in opposition we had quite a debate in this place, and it went on in the community, about the car parking provisions. They were obviously an attempt by the former government to take the FBT regime from the sublime to the ridiculous and they created immense difficulties for businesses trying to interpret what car parking was FBTable, if I can put it in those terms, and what was FBT exempt. So this legislation addresses those recommendations of the Bell report and simplifies the original provisions, and I know that these changes will be well and truly welcomed within the business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am disappointed with one aspect of the government's response. When the response came forward, I was watching to see whether the recommendation that the Bell task force made in respect of exempting meals from FBT and introducing a simplified formula for assessing the deductibility of meal expenses under the Income Tax Assessment Act would be addressed. Coming as I do from an electorate that is heavily based on tourism and hospitality, this was one recommendation that I obviously welcomed. It is one that I have raised a number of times with successive governments but, to this date, with no success. In fact, I have taken in the last week or so to writing to the government's Tax Consultative Task Force, which has now been established and which is chaired by my colleague Senator Brian Gibson, and I have asked for consideration to be given to this particular issue. I hope it will be. The government response <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business </EMPHASIS>makes this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided not to proceed with the Task Force recommendations on cars and meal entertainment given the proposals would result in some employers paying increased tax and the revenue cost and broader tax policy implications of the meal proposals. However, both car and meal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefits provided by small business can fall under the FBT record keeping exemption if the necessary conditions are met.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not sure exactly what that last part means, but I was disappointed that the government did not accept that recommendation. It seems to me that when the changes to the treatment of these meal and other entertainment expenses was brought in it was an attempt by the former government to solve a problem that they saw existed, and that was that some of these things were being abused. In fact, there was a need, I believe, to tighten up the way these claims were made. But what we saw in the end was what amounted to throwing out the baby with the bath water, and a lot of jobs were lost in the hospitality and tourism industries. I believe that the tax system is capable of taking account of the concerns that existed at the time but in other ways. Clearly substantiation of expenses is not unreasonable, and I would hope that in due course, having raised the matter with the tax consultative task force, further consideration will be given to that particular proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, the problems that we have with our tax system in Australia are well known. The complexity of our system, for anyone who has worked with it, is indicative of that particular problem. So tax reform in Australia is a priority, and I am pleased that the government has identified it as a priority and has moved towards undertaking a comprehensive review of our tax system. That is something that the previous government failed to do. It simply tinkered with the existing tax system and inevitably just made it more and more complex. Australia needs now and business needs now a complete and comprehensive reform of the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within the current tax system there are so many inbuilt disincentives. For instance, someone was drawing to my attention just the other day the fact that there are some people on $20,000 a year in salary or wages who are slightly better off than those on $30,000 a year. There is not much incentive in the current system to earn more, and I think we do hear that from constituents from time to time where they say that it is just not worth doing that extra work, doing that overtime or taking that extra job that is available, because 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11696"> in the end they are simply worse off. That is demonstrated when you look at a person's circumstances and you find that, because of the interaction of the welfare system with the wages system, it very often is the case that it is just not worth it. In fact, it is not only a matter of not being worth it; people are worse off sometimes when they are earning more. Those sorts of things need to be fixed, and clearly they can only be fixed by a fairly comprehensive review of the tax system and by a close look also at the welfare system. This cannot be fixed by simply making adjustments at the edge; it needs wholesale reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principles for reform of the tax system, in my view, are that the system ought to be fair, efficient, certain and simple to administer. They are the four principles that need to be applied to the reform of the tax system. In many respects, the present system clearly fails to meet them. In the context of the legislation we are looking at today, the number of amendments coming forward indicates the complexity of the system. But I think we can demonstrate also that the system is often unfair, is inefficient, is absolutely uncertain at times and is far from simple to administer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has established some broad criteria for its reform of the tax system. These are important. In the advertisement that appeared in the national press calling for input to the tax consultative task force, people were reminded that when making submissions they should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">bear in mind the government's view that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">there should be no increase in the overall tax burden;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly that is important.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">any new taxation system should involve major reductions in personal income tax with special regard to the taxation treatment of families;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I certainly subscribe strongly to that.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">consideration should be given to a broad&hyphen;based indirect tax to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">there should be appropriate compensation for those deserving of special consideration; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">reform of Commonwealth/State financial arrangements must be addressed. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are not exclusive, but there are five criteria set out there by the government for those who want to make submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have yet to see the full extent of what the Labor Party's response to this task force's work might be or what its response to the outcomes might be. They foreshadowed some of their positions in respect of some aspects of tax reform, but overall I would hope that the opposition would support broadly this attempt to fix up the Australian tax system so that it is in fact a fairer and better system. More importantly even than that, it should be a system which makes the Australian business environment able to be more competitive in a world where we desperately need to be competitive for the sake of creating jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The focus so far, both from the Labor Party and in the community&mdash;to some extent understandably&mdash;has been on the question of a goods and services tax, or perhaps what is better described as a consumption tax or a value added tax. I made the point that the government has clearly put that on the agenda because we have called for consideration to be given to a broad based indirect tax to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes. The reason for doing that obviously is that the current wholesale sales tax system which we labour under is so hopelessly out of date. Despite attempts to make it work better, the fact is that it does not work very well. There are all sorts of inconsistencies in it. Ultimately, of course, it has the fundamental flaw of taxing our exports at a time when one would have thought that that was quite inappropriate to the needs of our nation. So there are lots of good reasons why we should look seriously at a broad based consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing about the current wholesale sales tax is that it fails to recognise that spending patterns have changed dramatically in recent years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I will spend a fair bit of my time tonight responding to some remarks which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11697"> were made by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) in the debate last week on the state of the health insurance system and the government's promises on health care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to begin by picking up on some of the remarks which were made by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) earlier this evening. He finished his contribution by enthusiastically endorsing the government's tax reform agenda. The Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay), who is at the table, also foolishly endorses the government's tax reform proposals. I will spend a few minutes pointing out some of the difficulties the government is going to face with its tax reform agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for McPherson began by claiming that the government's agenda on tax reform is all about delivering a fairer system, one that is more effective and certain. No&hyphen;one can object to a tax system being fair, effective or certain. The difficulty the government is going to face is that it is seeking to set up a bogus consultative mechanism which will deliver the preferred outcome of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), a GST. The government will then go into the next election seeking to persuade the Australian people that they should allow a re&hyphen;elected Howard government or a re&hyphen;elected government led by P1 or P2, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) or the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), to implement the government's GST agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the main reasons we argue that a goods and services tax is unfair is that high income earners earn enough money that they can put some money aside in savings and superannuation, they can put some money into investments and the balance is spent on their consumption. For low income earners, almost their entire income is spent on consumption expenditure such as food, clothing or gear that their kids might need for school such as school uniforms, books and educational materials. Low income earners have less money to put aside for saving for their retirement and less money to put aside for investments. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the Labor Party's very firm view that introducing a GST which hits high income earners at the same rate as low income earners will place a relatively higher and unfair burden on low income earners. It is very clear that the burden placed on low income earners compared with high income earners is unfair to those low income earners.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister at the table interjects, `Like the Medicare levy.' One of the items we are discussing in tonight's bill is the income level at which the Medicare levy cuts in. The fact that we exempt low income earners from the Medicare levy is probably a good example of this whole argument, that for people who earn less than the Medicare levy threshold we say they should not be subject to any Medicare levy because they need every cent that they can earn or every cent that they receive from social security support, just to look after their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday the Minister for Finance and Administration, Mr Fahey, was on the front page of some of the Sunday newspapers arguing that the GST was certain, that it was the GST or nothing and that it was this government that was determined to implement the GST. Honourable members opposite have seen their support plummet as we have seen crisis after crisis this year; as we have seen the government stumble over policy flip&hyphen;flops such as in the nursing home policy; and as we have seen its attitude to a whole series of measures earlier this year. There were attempts to divert public attention by bringing in the phoney work for the dole program to distract attention from former Senator Bob Woods. We have seen a whole series of policy disasters from the government this year. That is the reason the government's support has evaporated this year as an increasing number of Australians have reached the conclusion that the hopes that they had in the Prime Minister, the hopes they had that this government would make a difference, seem to have been dissipated very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government thinks that its support base has been eroded by its unfair and retrospective nursing home changes, its multiple backflips and backdowns on nursing home 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11698"> policy, wait until the Liberal and National parties try to explain to the Australian people that, at the next election, in addition to being answerable for their policy flip&hyphen;flops on nursing home policy and pharmaceutical benefits, they are going to convince the Australian people they should vote to impose a new goods and services tax. That is when the amount of support they have out there in the wider community really will drop through the floor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to spend some time in the next 12 months discussing taxation reform, then what the Labor Party wants the government to do is not to spend all of its time working out ways to impose higher tax burdens on ordinary wage and salary earners. We do not want the government to spend all its time working out ways to impose a GST, a broad based goods and services tax which, when it has been introduced in every other country in the world, has started out at a low level and then as each year goes by governments step by step have ratcheted up the level of the GST. We do not want the government to be spending a lot of time working out new ways that new taxes can be used year by year to raise the general level of the taxation burden on the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we want the government to do is to spend a bit more of its time on closing off the tax loopholes that have already emerged&mdash;the tax loopholes that all of us in this parliament know exist today. The one that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the minister at the table are well aware of is the use of family trusts, which allow high income earners to avoid paying their fair share of income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the last election, the former Labor government and the former Treasurer, Ralph Willis, received written advice from the Australian Taxation Office indicating that there were very large sums of money which the Taxation Office believed could be obtained if the government was prepared to follow a course of action that was advised by the Commissioner of Taxation, Michael Carmody. What we have seen in the 18 months since then is that this government has not been prepared to follow the advice which was given to the former government. Under 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Treasurer, Peter Costello, we have had government decisions that have watered down the former government's crackdown, which was based on the Taxation Office's advice. The result of this is that every year this government looks after its mates who are using these family trusts is another year when ordinary wage and salary earners are forced to pay more in taxation because this government is not prepared to close those loopholes. Those things need to be part of the taxation debate if the government wants to go down the GST path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is determined to go down the path of a GST, as the Labor Party spokesman on health I am still waiting for the Prime Minister to let me know whether the government's plans will include a GST on health expenditure. We know in the Fightback package, which John Hewson took to the 1993 election, that health was zero rated. It was not quite clear what impact that would have on health care costs for ordinary wage and salary earners because, under some of the various analyses that were made at the time, each of the people who provide medical services might have been required to pay a GST on their business inputs, whether they be doctors, the hospital or other people. There are many ways to skin a cat and there are many ways you can increase the cost of health care by introducing a GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is not prepared to give us a commitment right at the very start then what the Australian people need to know is whether or not their health care costs will increase if the government imposes a GST. Are we going to have the 15 per cent GST imposed on health insurance premiums? What is the point in the government running around, fooling people on the cost of health insurance and falsely claiming that its tax rebate on health insurance is an attraction and encouragement for people to join health insurance if, at the same time, this government is working away in the back room to come up with a new 15 per cent additional cost for private health insurance? If people are currently paying $1,000 or $2,000 in annual health insurance premiums, imagine if the cost of those pre 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11699"> miums goes up by that 15 per cent. Imagine if for the single person paying $1,000 it increases to $1,150 or if the $2,000 health insurance package for a family goes up to $2,300.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people have a right to know at the start of this debate whether or not that 15 per cent GST will apply to health insurance premiums. Will it apply to the cost of visiting a general practitioner or a specialist? If it does apply to visits to the GP, will the government increase the Medicare rebate that currently covers the cost of a visit to a doctor who bulk bills? Or will the patient be hit with that 15 per cent tax as a new copayment? If someone gets treated in a hospital, will the 15 per cent be applied to the cost of all of the bills that are imposed by the private or public hospitals, by the specialists, by the anaesthetists and so on? Treatment in a hospital already adds up to quite a substantial cost and if a GST has to be paid by patients then that is going to mean the cost of hospital treatment will increase quite dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  seeks to increase the income level at which the Medicare levy cuts in. The new upper limits of the ranges for individuals and families will be $14,474 and $24,425 respectively. In a speech made last Thursday in this debate, the honourable member for Moreton made a number of remarks about bulk billing. In particular, referring to the government's position, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are committed to bulk&hyphen;billing. We know that low income people in particular need this . . . They need to know that they do not have to rustle around looking for money to pay the doctor's bill if their child needs access to a doctor. We understand that bulk&hyphen;billing has an important place and this government is committed to it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are views which the opposition is quite sympathetic to. What I found intriguing about the member for Moreton's contribution was that these comments were quite in contrast to earlier remarks he made about his claims that certain people were abusing the system of bulk&hyphen;billing and that you needed to abolish bulk&hyphen;billing so that people did not abuse the Medicare system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He went on to make some remarks about a report which was brought down in this House 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> last week&mdash;a report that I am sure is close to your heart, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;about some changes that were recommended by one of the committees of this parliament that would allow doctors, using the `mediclaim' system, to obtain immediate reimbursement for the Medicare component of doctors' bills. You will be pleased to know that the honourable member for Moreton has not walked away from the recommendations which the committee made at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me explain the impacts that those changes will have. Despite the fact that the honourable member for Moreton endorsed them in his contribution to this debate last Thursday, the changes would make it very difficult for those very same low income earners the honourable member for Moreton was mentioning to continue to receive medical services without having to make a co&hyphen;payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About 80 per cent of GP visits are bulk&hyphen;billed, which means that when people visit their GP the cost is met by the doctor, who lodges a claim, usually at the end of each month, on the government. The change the honourable member for Moreton is advocating is that doctors should be able to charge a co&hyphen;payment on top of the fee which the doctor gets from the government&mdash;the GP rebate, which is paid by Medicare. The honourable member for Moreton believes that that should be able to be obtained by the doctor through the mediclaim system: that is, by electronic transfer which provides the money more speedily to the doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment there is pressure on doctors to bulk&hyphen;bill because they cannot charge a co&hyphen;payment as well as obtain the Medicare rebate. Doctors have to make that choice. They can either bulk&hyphen;bill and receive the amounts directly from the government, or they can charge the patient and the patient lodges a claim for reimbursement from Medicare. The difference in the billing systems obviously puts pressure on doctors to, wherever possible, bulk&hyphen;bill. It prohibits any doctor from bulk&hyphen;billing and then imposing a co&hyphen;payment on top of the fee which the doctor receives from Medicare.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11700">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Moreton argues that doctors should be able to receive the bulk&hyphen;billing payment and, in addition, levy a co&hyphen;payment on the patient. That is a recipe for encouraging large numbers of doctors who are currently bulk&hyphen;billing 80 per cent of the population to continue bulk&hyphen;billing but impose these new co&hyphen;payments on patients. The honourable member for Moreton says that he and the government are committed to bulk&hyphen;billing and that he understands that people on low incomes `need to know that they do not have to rustle around looking for money to pay the doctor's bill if their child needs access to a doctor'. I think that explains eloquently that low income families, when they need to see their GP, should not have to either find the cost of co&hyphen;payments or be forced to provide the full cost of a visit to a doctor before they receive their Medicare rebate. We should remember that the AMA's recommended fee for a visit to a GP is $34 or more. If the Medicare rebate is much less than that, it means that the patient is required to pay a substantial amount of money up&hyphen;front. The honourable member for Moreton went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has taken a carrot and stick approach. It has offered incentives for people to get into private health insurance and penalties for higher income earners who are not in it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That carrot and stick approach of the higher Medicare levy, which is imposed on people whose incomes are over certain thresholds, together with the tax rebate of up to $450 for people who take out private health insurance, have not been too successful. The Labor Party argues that if you look at the massive cost of the health insurance rebate&mdash;at one point, it was $7 billion&mdash;there is very little to show for the government's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cut back federal funding for public hospitals by $800 million and for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by $500 million and completely abolished the Commonwealth dental health program, at $400 million, just to raise the $1.7 billion which it had blown on the private health insurance tax rebate. Despite the fact that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government announced in the August 1996 budget that this rebate was coming in, we still had people leaving private health insurance&mdash;up to 1,000 people a day in some quarters. The government claims that, with 35,000 people having joined in the most recent quarter, its policy is now a success. What it does not understand is that it spent about $50,000 of taxpayers' money for every person who has returned to private health insurance. That is the strongest possible evidence that this policy has been a complete and utter failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This policy, which has been funded by cutbacks in funding for public hospitals, has not reduced the cost of private health insurance. We all know that premium increases have swallowed up most of the benefit of that tax rebate; in fact, there has been a reduction in members since this policy was announced, and the pressure has certainly not been taken off public hospitals. This government's cutbacks in federal funding for public hospitals have made the crisis worse. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) referred to the funding cutbacks which had occurred. If there had not been a $10.5 billion debt when we came into government these cutbacks would not have had to happen. The government does not like to do this, but the fact is that you cannot live on bankcard all your life, which is what the Labor Party believes. These measures had to be taken. We hope the budget will be back in surplus by the next budget. I think that would be regarded by all Australians as a fantastic achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to Medicare and the Medicare rebate, the Labor Party set about to destroy the private health insurance system. They would have been happy to see every bed in a private hospital empty. That is their approach. They wanted to get rid of people, and they were pretty successful. The number of people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11701"> in private health insurance went from 62 per cent down to 32 per cent under the Labor Party, and that lengthened the queues in public hospitals, leaving 10,000 beds empty in private hospitals. That was a deliberate policy strategy by the Labor Party. The rebate system might only be small evidence that it is helping, but at least it did stop the rot. It stopped the numbers of people in private health insurance going down as it had been rapidly doing and decimating all private hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think those points ought to be made. Also, as I said right at the beginning in regard to the member's speech, this government would not have had to tackle cutbacks in public sector areas in this country except for the squandering of money that went on in an excessive manner by the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summarising this debate, I will go over some of the merits of the changes made by the bill to the taxation laws, and make just a few comments about the Medicare amendment bill. Firstly, on capital losses, new section 160ZPA gives effect to the announcement made by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 29 April 1997 that the government would introduce legislation to prevent company groups from multiplying capital gains tax losses. The bill also contains amendments to the anti-avoidance provisions contained in part 4A of the act to enable those provisions to apply to schemes which artificially create capital losses in the year in which the losses are created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to company loss rules will make it possible for companies held by discretionary trusts to deduct their prior and current year losses and amounts relating to debts. These changes will allay taxpayer concerns about whether companies held by discretionary trusts can deduct losses and debts. Also, the changes will create consistency between the proposed trust loss provisions and the company loss provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to fringe benefits tax legislation in this bill implement several of the measures foreshadowed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his statement `More time for business' in response to recommendations made by the small business deregu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lation task force. The amendments to the range of car parking and tax provisions will significantly reduce compliance costs for employers, and in particular for small businesses, in several areas and demonstrate the government's commitment to reducing FBT compliance costs for employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill corrects a deficiency in the sales tax law to ensure that goods imported into Australia under a temporary importation exemption used in Australia, exported and then reimported will be subject to sales tax at the time of the second importation. Amendments to the company tax instalments system will assist small companies by allowing instalment taxpayers classified as small to pay their final tax liability for an income year later than currently required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments here are to ensure that no franking credit or debit arises from the payment or refund of tax where those amounts are attributable to the retirement savings account business of a life assurance company and will implement the government's 1996 announcements concerning RSAs. This will bring the dividend imputation treatment of RSAs for life assurance companies into line with the treatment for banks and other financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill ensures that taxpayers will no longer be able to include amounts of expenditure as part of the costs base of an asset to the extent that the expenditure is deductible. The amendments will prevent double deductions that could currently arise in calculating the capital gain on the disposal of an asset, rectifying an anomaly with the current law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also gives effect to the budget announcement that existing deficiencies in the formula for calculating the passive income of insurance companies under the controlled foreign company measures would be removed. This amendment will give effect to the original policy intention of those amendments by excluding from passive income only the income derived on assets of the foreign subsidiary that are referrable to insurance policies held by residents who are not related to the controlled foreign company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments on average calculated liabilities of life assurance companies, which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11702"> require life assurance companies to use average calculated liabilities as a basis for working out taxable income, will provide a more accurate reflection of the liabilities a life assurance company has for policies held during the year to be used in the assessment of income tax and will prevent distortions caused by the use of calculated liabilities at the end of the income year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New section 61A will ensure that taxpayers who became taxable prior to 3 July 1995 bring their depreciable assets into the taxation system at their notional written down value. I will be moving an amendment in the consideration in detail stage to protect taxpayers who receive private binding rulings inconsistent with new section 61A.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to summing up on the  Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) , I would just make the following comments. The Medicare levy low income exemption is for the thresholds to be changed. The bill implements a 1997&hyphen;98 budget measure to increase the low income exemption thresholds that ensure that low income individuals and families are exempt from the Medicare levy. The thresholds for the 1997-98 financial year will be increased to $13,389 from $13,127 for individuals, and $22,594 from $22,152 for families. The family exemption threshold continues to be increased by $2,100 for each dependent child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These increased exemption thresholds result in changes to the income ranges over which the exemptions are shaded out. The new upper limits of the ranges for individuals and families will be $14,474 and $24,425 respectively. The individual exemption threshold is also used to provide an exemption from the Medicare levy surcharge for a low income person who would otherwise be liable for the surcharge because of the level of income of the person's spouse. The exemption level there is also to be increased to $13,389.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">What this issue revolves around is the attempt in the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R372">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1997</XREF>  to exempt all taxi travel from the application of the fringe benefits tax. In 1995 Labor reviewed the operation of the fringe benefits tax with a view to simplifying the compliance burden and exempting benefits where this was considered justified. We made some changes. In particular, we provided an exemption for outside hours taxi travel&mdash;that is, between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m.&mdash;principally on security grounds for people who were required to travel to and from work during those times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal to exempt all taxi travel from the application of fringe benefits tax will mean that directors and executives will be able to negotiate tax free travel by taxi to and from work if they so desire. That ought to be contrasted with the situation facing ordinary workers: they have to pay for their own travel to and from work on the bus, the train, the tram, et cetera, from their after tax income. Labor opposes this proposal on equity grounds. The exemptions that we introduced in 1995 recognised the special circumstances of late night or early morning travel. We believe those exemptions should remain but that no further exemption should be granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To move in this way shows a typical disregard on the part of this government for ordinary PAYE taxpayers who will not be able to take advantage of a benefit of this kind. If I and other members of the opposition believed that ordinary workers would be able to take advantage of taxi travel to and from work, and that their employers would be happy to provide that for them, we would be prepared to consider such an amendment. However, the fact is that only those who are already well off will be able to take advantage of this provision. So we do not believe it has an equity case for it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11703">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is yet another example of the government's poor priorities. The Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), in summing up the second reading debate, talked about the $10 billion black hole. That is the kind of excuse we get for this government's appalling treatment of older Australians, for example. Amongst other things, we have had the introduction of new up&hyphen;front entry fees for nursing homes, the debacle with the nursing home accommodation bonds and plan three, four or five which we heard today of residents having to find an extra $4,400 or so per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the government imposing new income tested daily fees for nursing homes on top of the existing daily fees. We have seen increased prescription charges, with four million concession card holders now paying 50c more for each prescription. Prescriptions have gone up from $2.70 to $3.20. We have seen spending cuts to Australian Hearing Services. Some 30,000 Commonwealth senior card holders are no longer eligible for free hearing aids. The Commonwealth dental health program has been abolished and four million concession card holders now no longer have access to free dental health. We have seen spending on home and community care services slashed. All of that shabby treatment of older Australians was justified by reference to this huge black hole: `We, the government, hate to do this to you but we have no choice.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is yet another example of a hole being introduced into the tax base. I point this out to the House against the background of what has been described as the family tax initiative, costing a billion dollars per year. We have seen health insurance rebates costing around $600 million per year. We have seen capital gains tax provisions for business worth almost $400 million per year. We have seen a further $50 million per year in fringe benefits tax concessions. Those concessions amount to around $2 billion a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you add to that the ludicrous savings rebate proposal, that costs a further $2 billion per year within a few years. All of that punches a hole of around $4 billion per year 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the income tax base of the country. On top of that you have the capital gains tax concessions and the fringe benefits tax concessions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS>. On the one hand, the government is saying, `We have no money. Therefore, we have to do all these shabby things to older people, such as introducing nursing home accommodation bonds and cutting into dental health and hearing programs.' On the other hand, the government can find the money to give away approximately $4 billion per year in revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case, we do not know what the cost of the fringe benefits tax exemption for free taxi travel will be. It is not set out in the explanatory memorandum. My recollection is that the car parking exemption will cost about $35 million, but no estimate is provided for the exemption for taxi travel. Nonetheless, it is of the same character: it reflects poor priorities on the part of the government. Therefore, the opposition will not support it. As a result, we have moved an amendment which will delete that particular proposal. I urge honourable members to support our amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are opposed to this amendment. It is quite remarkable that the opposition would be opposing this legislation because it does help ordinary workers in regard to taxi travel and so forth. The purpose of our proposed amendment is to reduce the cost of complying with the existing exemption for taxi travel. Under the existing law, for an employer to qualify for the exemption, the employer would need to determine the time at which the travel commences, the departure and the arrival point, and whether the travel was directly between home and work before the benefit would qualify for the exemption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think most members understand the complexities of administration in these types of issues. It is pretty important to alleviate that burden when you consider that it will also be beneficial to people who will be travelling home before 7 o'clock in the evening. A lot of workers do travel home before that time, and they may need a taxi for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11704"> whatever purpose. They will be the beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the comment that it is the wealthy who will benefit from this. Quite frankly, people who are on better salaries are usually provided with a car by companies. So I do not believe that comes into the equation. This is a measure which lifts the burden off a lot of small employers and other employers in the community and which reduces the paperwork that is involved with it. Not only that, it benefits the battlers and the workers within the community. So we are opposed to this amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We find the amendment moved by the government a bit disturbing. We have been told that the primary aim of schedule 10 is to clarify the way the tax commissioner has always construed the depreciation provisions involving balancing charges with respect to previously tax exempt entities. This amendment is supposed to show that this is beyond doubt. Indeed, paragraphs 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9 at pages 114 and 115 of the explanatory memorandum confirm that the schedule is to affirm what the commissioner has previously ruled. For example, paragraph 10.7 states, inter alia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner has consistently administered section 61 . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Surely if the commissioner has consistently administered the depreciation provisions, whether by way of private binding ruling or any other actions, this amendment would be redundant. So it is not consistent for the government to argue that they are clarifying the law to ensure that it accords with what taxpayers have been advised and then to come in here and say that they wish to exclude the effect of the new law on taxpayers to whom they have previously given binding private rulings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would appreciate an explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) of this anomaly. It suggests that the commissioner has issued binding private rulings that are inconsistent

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment arises out of a recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report into the conduct of the 1996 general election. Recommendation No. 62 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act be amended to provide that donations to an independent candidate at a Federal or State election are tax deductible, at the same level as donations to registered parties.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It should be quite clear to everyone in this place that I may have a beneficial interest in this, although that is arguable. As a potential unendorsed, and therefore Independent, candidate at a subsequent election, I believe it is a matter of equity that any donors to my campaign, provided they do not exceed the stipulated $100, should benefit from tax deductibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of those matters which is a bit of an anachronism. There are not many Independents in this parliament. The couple that were in the previous parliament probably never felt constrained to make a submission along these lines. Mr Mack, the former member for North Sydney, eschewed any 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> raids on the public purse&mdash;and I suppose taxed donations can be put in that category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, along with my colleagues the member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the member for Calare (Mr Andren), do not have party affiliations. As the law stands at present, donations to my campaign and to the campaigns of my colleagues&mdash;cannot be tax deductible. The same also applies to Independent members in state parliaments. I have within the boundaries of my electorate a very fine Independent member in Dr Elizabeth Constable MLA, the member for Churchlands. My mind also goes across the river to another Independent candidate, the Hon. Phillip Pendal MLA, the member for South Perth. They, along with all other Independent members, must surely, as a matter of ordinary justice, be in the same position as their main opponents, who are usually drawn from the ranks of the major parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proposing a matter of simple equity. The present situation is something of an anachronism. It is understandable that to date donations to the campaigns of Independents have not benefited from tax deductibility because it is not in the interests of the major parties, it is not something which preoccupies their collective minds. If it is not pressed by someone like me or one of my colleagues&mdash;the member for Calare or the member for Moore&mdash;the chance is that even though what is being preposed is fair and just it will never be dealt with in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My main objective is quite clear. But, at the same time, I want to stress that, whilst it might be doubtful that we can move an amendment to a money bill in the House of Representatives because of constitutional limitations on members of this House, those limitations do not apply in this case. The fact is that what I am proposing confers a benefit on taxpayers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> What we are striving for is simple justice. It is a matter which any government will come to grips with sooner or later. It might as well be sooner. The government might as well get it out of the way. If it does not do it on this occasion, it will simply, as a matter of common decency, have to legislate in its own time. The point I was going to make before 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11707"> is that it is not an imposition which is not shared across the political spectrum. It is not, I suspect, going to involve any great burden on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proposing, therefore, in my new schedule 11 amendment, changes to section 78 of the act. The provisions of my amendment are far more stringent than those which are now in the act and applicable to the political parties themselves or candidates of political parties. They are limited in their application in a way that donations to parties and their candidates are not so limited. I have proposed to make sure that donations are limited to a within a certain period so that it cannot be construed or even suggested that some personal advantage would accrue to an individual Independent candidate. In the new proposed subsection (9A) of section 78(a), it is proposed that the tax deductibility will apply if:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the contribution was made for the purpose of assisting the person to meet the costs he or she has incurred or will incur in connection with an election; and</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">It then goes on to set out the forms of donations which will apply for tax deductibility. In relation to donations to political parties, in the new subsection 78(10) I am proposing that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The total deductions allowable to a taxpayer under subsection (9) or (9A) in respect of a year of income must not exceed $100.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In every sense of the term, I propose a fair approach. Whilst it is more stringent on Independent candidates and their supporters, it is nevertheless appropriately worded. I repeat: I urge the government to support it. There is no doubt a case exists for acceptance purely on the grounds of equity. It has been recommended by the relevant joint standing committee, and it is just a matter of decency to other candidates. If the government is so persuaded it will accept it because by doing so it will avoid the need to move a similar amendment on a future occasion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act be amended to provide that donations to an Independent candidate at a Federal or State election are tax deductible at the same level as donations to registered parties.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public funding of election campaigns is allegedly designed to lessen the extent to which political parties are reliant on financial support from trade unions, corporations and wealthy individuals. What a neat arrangement that is: having the value of both private and public funding and locking Independents out of the arrangement by virtue of the taxation laws and the inability of Independents to attract corporate dollars&mdash;not that any of us would be particularly interested in attracting corporate dollars but it excludes many people in the community who are unable financially to access the parliamentary process unless they happen to enjoy a particularly high 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11708"> profile in their community. An enormous number of people with an enormous amount to contribute to this parliamentary system are locked out by the very instruments that sustain and nurture the party system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system is stacked in favour of the party club and against individual Independents. Almost $250,000 was spent in electronic advertising alone against me in the seat of Calare in the last campaign. I spent about $50,000, half of that in print, with $8,000 being spent in the last couple of days to counter a quite misleading Liberal Party commercial that tried to smear me with some association with the former Prime Minister and his party, philosophy and such.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an absolute disgrace. The public realised the games that were being played and in fact I believe that delivered me quite a few more votes than helped the cause of any particular party campaign. Such is the astuteness of the electorate, which is so devalued by the party system and their massive advertising campaigns. I would rather see a limit of $50,000 placed on any candidate in an election campaign. That would then level the playing field to make this a true and fairer democracy, otherwise we will have the best democracy money can buy, and that will not include Independents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parties received back about 40 per cent of the vote, at $1.50 a vote, in the seat of Calare plus that tax allowance under section 78. Therein lies the unfairness of this system. On 20 October the member for Curtin asked the Treasurer (Mr Costello) whether he believed an inequity exists in regard to tax deductibility for Independents and whether the Treasurer believed the act needed amending. The Treasurer, to the usual guffaws from the party members of this House, treated the question, I believe, with jocularity. He said it was `an interesting point'. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The Treasurer said he believed the reason for the anomaly, as he judged public opinion represented by the two sides of this chamber&mdash;here we are, four out of the five Independents present, and I would suggest a few more next time around; there are not two sides to this chamber: we are part of the non- 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">government side and I wish the Treasurer and others would realise that fact, because it will haunt them and hit them between the eyes even more so down the track&mdash;is that there seems to be more support for tax deductibility for political parties than Independents. Who says so? Was that in any mandate won in March 1996? Put it to a referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What arrogance that the Treasurer should `check with my colleagues whether there is a widespread view in favour of that before announcing any particular position'. I believe that the public requests and demands that this sort of deductibility be allowed in the interests of democratic fairness. The Treasurer does not have to ask his colleagues. They have already spoken, in fact. They spoke in recommendation 62 of this particular report. It is there, clear as I read it and even trimmed back slightly by the member for Curtin in his quite fair and reasonable amendment moved in a responsible way, which I would expect from the member for Curtin. Doesn't it mean anything that his colleagues have spoken in a joint parliamentary committee's recommendation? It seems as though the Treasurer will act only if the executive is good and ready to act. The parliament has spoken through the committee, which makes these amendments irresistible. To oppose them is not only hypocritical but undemocratic.</PARA></SPEECH>

Yet here we see a situation where it is up to an independent member to propose to this chamber an amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1997, to the taxation laws, something which is fundamental to what would be a normal operating democratic system, and that is equality for all candidates.

As an independent member I am able to represent them in a way that puts their interests first rather than the interests of a political party or some other body. I must say to the chamber that I find that far more satisfying than I ever did as a member of a party. I am not reflecting on members of the parties because I know that some go out of their way to represent their constituents within the limitations of party representation. But I cannot understand, for the life of me, why one particular candidate is treated differently from another. Why is a member of a party able to enjoy the opportunity of attracting donations that attract a tax deduction and another candidate is not? It is illogical, it is unfair, it is undemocratic and I believe it is un&hyphen;Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should that be the case? Even though the parliamentary committee that is charged with the responsibility of looking into electoral matters has come out with a recommendation that there be equality, it is up to an independent member to move the amendments necessary to bring that into force. In my view, not only is that disgraceful, it is anti-democratic and it reflects the cosy, familiar 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relationship that exists between the two major political blocs in our system to perpetuate themselves to the detriment of the constituents whom they are supposed to represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say is that any member who opposes this amendment ought to be thoroughly ashamed of themselves because this represents, in essence, an opportunity to set the balance straight or to make the playing field level, as the government is often wont to describe its efforts to introduce some of its amendments or reforms to the way our economy works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, many people in this country today view our political system with a great deal of jaundice. They want something that is different. They want to be able to see alternatives. Unfortunately, our system militates against those alternatives by preventing anyone other than the major political parties from being able to accept donations that involve a tax deduction on the part of the donor. This amendment by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) moves to redress that inequality. In my view it is one of the most important amendments in recent times to ensure that this chamber, this parliament, reflects a truly democratic and accountable system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it would have been better if the Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) had sat down after he said that they were not going to accept the amendment, because he really got into some strange territory. As for the note on which he finished, my colleague the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) has already made it quite clear that&mdash;and I will give the Treasurer (Mr Costello) the benefit of the doubt in that he was giving an answer to a genuine question without notice&mdash;the Treasurer came up with an answer after he admitted ironically that he did not know what the particular recommendation in the report of the committee said. For that to now be a reason for not agreeing to this amendment is bordering on childish. He has had time since I asked that question but, the committee having reported, why would he need to go and check with his colleagues, and why the delay? It is hardly justification for a delay for what is a very straightforward proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary mentioned public funding. It does grate with members of the opposition because, although the Electoral Act says that it shall be paid to individual candidates, the party interposes itself and says, `Well, yes, but because we are large parties we will provide in the act that it perhaps should be dispersed by us.' They would collect their public funding at $1.50&hyphen;odd per primary vote and they would disperse it and those poor souls who live in safe electorates do not see a brass razoo&mdash;hardly justification for an attitude expressed towards this amendment which, incidentally, has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with public funding.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11711">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the politics of envy about an additional staff member, goodness gracious me, as Sir Joh might have said. So we get an extra staff member. Isn't it something to be aboard!  We do not have the party apparatus; we do not have the people running around at the secretariat to feed us with gobbledegook. I might say that when I was on the receiving end of that it was some comfort to receive this whole avalanche of stuff weekly, but I also have to say that I only ever used 0.01 per cent of it. But it was a comfort to know that I had that information there in the drawer upon which I could call if the need arose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The red herrings drawn across the floor by the parliamentary secretary really do him and the government no credit, and certainly the argument put forward for not accepting the amendment and for in effect waiting for the Treasurer to come back from overseas to check with him before they decide whether they will do anything is in fact hardly the stuff of good, decisive government. It is certainly not the stuff of a government which is prepared to do the right thing when the argument overwhelmingly supports the case. Of course, the parliamentary secretary had the decency not to argue against the principled position that the amendment put forward proposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I regret the fact that the parliamentary secretary took it upon himself to digress from the real issue and introduce, as I have said, red herrings into the argument. The question is about tax deductibility for donations of up to $100 to campaign funds of Independents under conditions which are far more stringent than those applied to donations of candidates put forward by political parties.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take much time, except to correct what might be a perception out there that I might have put away whatever my public funding amount was. In fact, I paid full tax on that. It was added to my income for the 1995&hyphen;96 year. I have got no real problem with that. The problem I have had is the inordinate increase in the amount of funding that is expended by the party system, to the exclusion of independent candidates because they cannot afford it. I was happy to pay back half 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of my $34,000. The $17,000 did not meet my bills. I put a rollover account of about $11,000 to pay off my bills, plus a few thousand more, so it cost me about $15,000 to run. That was money that was going to pay off a bit of the mortgage. So, no, there is no advantage to me in that particular system.</PARA></TALK.START>

It enables us to meet the needs of our electorate and to try partially to match the resources that the party system has, both financially and in terms of personnel. It enables us to treat all the legislation as adequately as possible, and in great detail, might I say. As the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) said, the amendment he has moved has far more stringent requirements on us as Independents than those required by the party system. I can only repeat what I said earlier, that this is not some sort of Independent game we are playing; it is truly in the interests of allowing people to step out of the general community, not go through the party system and represent their constituents as fairly as I believe I am attempting to do without the paraphernalia and the imposts of the party system.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of all people in this House, I suppose I would be the person in the best position to speak on this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or unions; that is right. Therefore this funding goes to the party to help in funding of campaigns and for other forms of media exposure to get them voted into government. The cost of my campaign was considerable. Apart from all that, my funding came to the amount of $55,000. I have not asked for this money to go to me personally but to go back to my electorate. After taking out my expenses, which were about $12,000, I had stated a couple of days before the election that this money would go back to my electorate to support my electorate either with a police car, to support the hospital system or even to help the terminally ill. But the Liberal Party continues to fight me on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that the government or the opposition have the right to be hypocritical on this matter. We must all be treated fairly and equally in this House. If it is good for the Liberal Party, the Democrats, the Greens or the Labor Party, it is good enough for the Independents to receive their electoral funding, especially on the grounds of this being right across the board for everyone. Also, any contributions given to the Independents should be tax deductible, just like anyone else's. We are accountable to our constituents and to the Australian people for the sort of job we do here in the House. I support the amendment moved by the member for Curtin on this issue.

I want to speak at moderate length on a couple of schedules in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1997, which I have had some time to study.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn firstly to schedule 3. The government deserves credit for agreeing to some minor aspects of reform of the fringe benefits tax regime as outlined in schedule 3 of the bill. However, it is timely to reflect on the more significant small business deregulation task force, the SBDT, recommendations that the government has at the same time chosen to ignore. It was noted in a recent adjournment speech that the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia, the CCIWA, in its response to the government's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS> statement highlighted that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In establishing the deregulation taskforce, the Commonwealth Government described its target as the reduction of the paper and compliance burden on small business by 50 per cent. Full implementation of the 62 recommendations of the deregulation taskforce would not have seen this target reached, the government's demand for revenue neutrality denying such an outcome from the onset.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Nonetheless, the CCIWA went on to note that the proposals presented to the government by its task force were not insubstantial. In fact, the SBDT nominated five facets of FBT that warranted immediate action by the government in order to simplify the system and thereby reduce the compliance burden on the small business sector. These included a simplified valuation formula for motor vehicles, based on the purchase price, and exempting all meals from fringe benefits taxes, along with a straightforward formula for assessing deductibility of meal expenses for income tax purposes. I seem to remember the latter was one of those non&hyphen;core promises that the coalition made during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The SBDT also recommended that car parking and taxi travel be FBT exempt, that the FBT year should be aligned with the income tax year and that the arranger provisions should be altered so that the onus of paying fringe benefits tax lies with the supplier of the benefit. Had the government agreed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11713"> to those reforms it would have sent a very clear message to the business community. It would have demonstrated a resolve to tackle the very considerable compliance difficulties and costs of FBT that have been highlighted by successive government reports. Instead, the coalition produced a four&hyphen;point plan which, despite what the spin doctors would have us believe, will have very limited practical application for small business.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 17 February 1997 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reported the then Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number one issue in the deregulation taskforce report was the complexity and the compliance time and the cost of FBT . . . We are worried about the time taken and the complexity of complying with FBT.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What the then minister should have gone on to add was that this government has proven itself to be concerned about remedying the difficulties faced by business in complying with FBT only in so far as it does not affect the budget bottom line. The decision to exempt employers who submit an FBT return of $5,000 or less from keeping fringe benefits tax records has been thoroughly discredited by tax professionals who argue that no proprietor should be encouraged to adopt such a cavalier attitude towards accurate recording.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as the coalition has backed away from its promised 50 per cent reduction in the compliance burden on small business during the term of this parliament, so too it has ignored the SBDT's call for the alignment of FBT with the income tax year. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> Just as the government has failed to meet its deadline for the pledged 20 per cent reduction in compliance with Australian Bureau of Statistics forms, it has failed to commit itself to the total exemption of car parking from FBT. The decision to exempt car parking provided by small businesses to employees on the business's own premises, while welcome, is likely to have only a limited application, according to the CCIWA. Further, in differentiating between car parking that is provided on and off site, small businesses operating in an inner city area will be penalised for no reason other than that there 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are very limited opportunities to provide parking on site in these locations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The SBDT proposal to exempt all parking from FBT is consistent with recommendation 4.3 of the 1995 Senate Economic References Committee looking into the tax treatment of small business. In suggesting that car parking be exempt from FBT that committee did not qualify that the parking had to be on the site of the business, but simply noted that `the general issue of FBT on car parking seems to have created confusion and an onerous burden of compliance'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government ignored this recommendation, and it stands condemned for its inaction on simplification of FBT generally. However, it is the current government which, during the 1996 election campaign, marketed itself as the saviour of small businesses, and its performance should be judged accordingly. To date, the coalition has continued to avoid dealing with the most significant recommendations of its own task force. Arguably, the FBT regime is most cumbersome and costly to comply with in relation to meal entertainment and it was in this area that the SBDT proposed the most widespread of changes, calling for the complete exemption of all meals from the impost. The SBDT concluded that most meals are offered within a legitimate business context and argued against the need for differentiation by business between the kind of meal offered and the conditions under which it is offered. The same point was emphasised in the 1995 report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The tax treatment of small business</EMPHASIS>, which noted that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The taxation base for the FBT had expanded too much and was taxing not only items of remuneration, but also legitimate business costs.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, the government rejected this recommendation outright because of the negative impact it would have had on the aggregate FBT tax take. Apparently, it is prepared to absorb a loss of revenue of $35 million per annum for the 1997&hyphen;98 year as a result of the exemption of parking from FBT, but it has baulked at doing the same on meal entertainment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry bodies, including the CCIWA, have been scathing in their criticism of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11714"> coalition's failure to introduce any sort of reform to meal entertainment expenses. It noted that small business understands that real reform will have both policy and revenue implications for the government but that there is reasonable expectation that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a government supportive of business will address these issues head on, recognising, in particular, that the costs of compliance borne by business are often disproportionately greater than the tax collected.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This point was demonstrated clearly in evidence provided to a Senate estimates committee as far back as May 1993 when it was revealed that the Australian Taxation Office had found an average of $52,000 of errors in every fifth FBT return submitted and that this high error rate was attributed to the complexity of the FBT regime. That was some four years ago. In the meantime there have been countless additions and amendments to the act, making it even more voluminous and complex. It would be no surprise then to note that in the 1995&hyphen;96 year the ATO imposed $2.8 million of penalties on businesses for filling out FBT returns incorrectly. Yet the government has sidelined those SBDT recommendations that would have seen the most substantive reduction in this complexity. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From its humble beginnings in 1986, the fringe benefits tax has turned into a nice little earner for the Commonwealth, with collections rising to $3 billion for the year ended June 1996. Three of the four concessions made by the government with regard to FBT in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More Time for Business</EMPHASIS> statement will have a negligible impact on the revenue raising capacity of the impost. If the coalition were interested in paying more than lip&hyphen;service to its promises to the small business sector, it should have incorporated each of the task force's recommendations on the reform of FBT in this very bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In schedule 5, the bill seeks to extend the time available to instalment taxpayers classified as being small to paying their estimated tax liability on 15 December following the income year and the balance of their liability on the following 15 March. According to the explanatory memorandum, the whole point in extending the time in which a small enterprise 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has to meet its tax obligation is `to assist them in managing their cash flow'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in this context that an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> late last week, relating to what impact the new 15 per cent superannuation impost will have on the cash flow of small business, needs to be considered. According to the director of taxation at the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Mr Ian Langford&hyphen;Brown, small businesses will have to complete their tax returns five months earlier than usual in order to comply with this new requirement. Whereas small businesses would have had until 15 March each year to lodge their income tax returns, in future any small business owner who is also the trustee of a superannuation fund will have to comply with the new regular notification date of 31 October.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any benefits to cash flow that a small business might have enjoyed&mdash;and I acknowledge there will be some&mdash;courtesy of the extension to the time they have to pay their final tax liability is certain to be eroded by their obligations under the new superannuation tax. As Mr Langford&hyphen;Brown rightly observed that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is very disappointing behaviour for a federal government that's supposed to be committed to cutting red tape for small businesses and helping promote small business growth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is just one more example of the government's preparedness to make a minor concession to the private sector while simultaneously adding to the overall compliance burden on small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 March 1997, the former Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), told newspaper reporters that his government would know it had improved conditions for small businesses when `if at the end of the day we have made life easier for small business'. The Association for Compliance Professionals Australia, which was established in the months after the election and which aims to keep business abreast of its ever increasing tax obligations, suggests that the small business sector is still waiting for that day to come. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11715">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent survey by AC Neilson McNair suggests that tax compliance is costing the small business sector up to $7 billion each year. That is $7 billion that cannot be used by small businesses and their proprietors either to fund the growth of their small businesses or to employ additional staff. The running of a small business has evolved into a highly complex undertaking, thanks in part to our Byzantine taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the estimation of Mr Greg Hayes, from the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, small businesses administer 10 different taxes, each of which has five different compliance requirements, over the course of a year. He said, in an interview with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That's 50 different tax functions, none of which adds to productivity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The decision by the coalition to provide additional time for instalment taxpaying small businesses to meet their tax obligations is entirely consistent with its election commitment to reduce the regulatory burden on the sector and is supported. However, it should be remembered that the recommendation by the Bell deregulation task force to align the FBT year with the income tax year has been ignored by the government. This was not the first time that such a recommendation was made. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key recommendations of the 1995 Senate Economics References Committee into the tax treatment of small business was that the FBT year should be brought into alignment with the financial year. Successive small business surveys have shown that the fringe benefits tax payment schedule is among the most difficult to administer, yet the government chose to ignore this in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS> statement. This gives further weight to the CCIWA's claim:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">recommendations of the SBDT&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that were most important, particularly those relating to tax compliance, were also the most confronting to the government. It appears that the government has stepped away from these issues in consequence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The coalition's decision to extend the time available for small business to meet their tax obligation was no doubt made in part because 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it will not adversely affect the overall tax take. Rather, the changes in this bill will merely see the deferral of a small amount of tax, and that within any one financial year. Despite the fact that the changes to the timing of fringe benefits tax sought by the SBDT would have had the same consequence, the recommendation was ignored in full by the government. With the government now more than halfway through its first term, the time has come for it to expedite a thorough reform of the overall regulatory burden on small business, instead of token gestures like this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the government that the red tape burden faced by the small business sector will not be substantially improved by a simple reduction in regulations like that with which I am dealing now. What is needed is a total review of the practices and concerns of the government&mdash;that is assuming one is needed after all this time&mdash;or the coalition risks being seen as standing in the way of a more profitable and viable small business sector.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S124">Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997</XREF>  has been acknowledged by both sides of the chamber as being a very important piece of legislation, but it has been characterised by a form of debate by those opposite which does not underscore the importance that they as a government place on the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contributions of government members have been characterised by attacks on the opposition that, inter alia, talk about 17 inquiries, 13 years and not much being done. A number of opposition speakers have acknowledged that that was not good enough. I would join with my colleagues in saying that more could have been done. To give credit where credit is due, the process to do the right thing by small business was there. When the parliament was prorogued for the election, there was a piece of legislation before the parliament which would have gone forward. If we are going to have a fair debate about this, that type of partisan debate should be dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The substance of the additional debate by those opposite is that the second reading amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) as the spokesperson for the opposition is in some way playing politics.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading amendment and the amendments that will be moved on behalf of the opposition in the consideration in detail stage do one thing: they try to put in place, in legislative form, the principle of the report of the House of Representatives Industry, Science and Technology Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of that committee, I have to say, with the greatest sincerity, that I have been disappointed by the way in which this report has been dealt with in the debate. There are substantial matters of difference between what is in this legislation and what was recommended by the committee. Even the committee chair, the honourable member 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11717"> for Bendigo (Mr Reid), did not go to those differences. I am quite happy to listen to the  debate and to be told, especially by those who were members of the committee, why, in the short while since the committee's report was tabled, they have changed their minds about matters of great substance.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of those matters is that the committee recommended that the notion of `unfair conduct' be reflected in the amendments to the Trade Practices Act. These amendments contained within this bill, of course, refer to the equitable doctrine of unconscionable conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of interjection, I tried to get the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans)&mdash;for the short period in which the honourable member for Bendigo was away at the UN he was the acting chair of the committee&mdash;to discuss the matters contained in chapter 6, which goes to the legislative protection against unfair conduct. It might be pertinent to read the Shakespearian quote with which we head off that chapter&mdash;`The law hath not been dead though it hath slept.' With the doctrine of unconscionability, if one looks at the way it has been practised, it has been of no great benefit to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This chapter goes in some great detail to justify the conclusion that the committee came to: that is, the type of amendments required that should have been contained in this piece of legislation should have referred to unfair conduct. So far in the debate, in what I believe to be a fairly cursory investigation of the matters at hand, unfair conduct has been dismissed because in some way it is a new concept, there is no basis in past law to justify it; whereas the doctrine of unconscionability has a background in law and, therefore, is believed to be easier to put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I grant that, if one goes to the explanatory memorandum, there is a fuller discussion of the options that were available to the government and why the conclusion that was come to has been arrived at. But I challenge those opposite&mdash;especially those who were members of the committee and who signed off on the report&mdash;to enter into the debate and justify why they as individuals come before us and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support an amendment that was not supported by the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I have had periods as government backbenchers. We know how it works. The minister either sends the package around to justify the bill, or you trot around to the minister to get some idea. But what has characterised the government members' contributions to this debate is that they are all just toeing the party line. I expect better. I really want to see a fuller investigation and discussion of the matters at hand.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CADMAN" NAMEID="SD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr Cadman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can't stand over our blokes like you do.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HH4">Mr JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not too sure about that. I think you have had some experience of that in your past guise as a whip. But we will not go into that in this debate. In the committee's report, conclusions were arrived at about the legislative protection that was required. Paragraph 6.57 of the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee believes that it is necessary to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to provide a general statutory standard of fairness in commerce broader than the present equitable doctrine of unconscionability.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I repeat the word `broader'. So, distinctly, the decision that has been made by the government is to go for a narrower form of protection for small business than that recommended by the committee. Let us not beat around the bush: that is what is happening as a result of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments do pick up on what the committee recommended about giving guidance as part of the act as to what sort of behaviour might be considered as unconscionable. But it still does not go to that broader concept that the committee was proposing of unfair conduct. Why did the committee come to that conclusion? There were other proposals put to the committee that the act should be amended so that there would be sanctions against harsh, oppressive and unconscionable behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In evidence, including evidence from the ACCC, it was decided that perhaps that did not give clarity. Again, I will read into the record a quote from the committee's report. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11718"> It has to be done to remind people what the committee intended. Paragraph 6.70 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The word `unfair' has the strong advantage of being widely understood being part of the everyday  moral vocabulary of all Australians. Indeed, fairness is the social value central to the maintenance of social cohesion and the legitimacy of the social system. It has the added advantage of directly addressing the problem as it is usually articulated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The term `unfair' is also used within the US law. For example the Federal Trade Commission defines `unfair' as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> whether the practice without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law or otherwise; whether, in other words, it is within the penumbra of some common law statutory or other established concept of `unfairness';</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> whether it causes substantial injury to consumers or competitors or other businessmen.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We can go to other law, we can go to other jurisdictions, and we can get the guidance. The guidance would still be there if the opposition's amendments are accepted, because they give the same sort of guidance to the jurisdictions as to what we believe to be unfair conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be remembered that unconscionability has a special disability test. A number of things through the law have been decided to be the basis for that special disability. But there was one thing in the past that was not included in that special disability test&mdash;that is, the differences in bargaining power between the parties. That has never been considered to constitute a special disability. If anything, this report was about that imbalance. That was what this report was all about. That is what the government needs to address in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other aspects of the bill that are cause for concern, that are discussed in the second reading amendment and that will be tackled by the amendments in the consideration in detail stage go to the definition&mdash;or the de facto definition&mdash;of small business, by limiting the provisions of the new 51AC to transactions of less than $1 million. That is con 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tained in the new provision 51AC at clause 7. The honourable member for Cowan waxed lyrical about how businesses with transactions of over $1 million surely could not be considered to be small businesses. But there are circumstances where contractual arrangements entered into by small businesses can total $1 million. That is not outside the realms of possibility. For instance, if a small business entered into a five-year contract and the rental for each year was $200,001&mdash;meaning the total of the contract was $1,000,005&mdash;that would put it outside these provisions. I would contend that such a situation is not totally outside the realms of possibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example is that of a business entering into an agreement over a 10-year period where the rental for each year is $100,001. That business would then be outside of these conditions. I think it is a tragedy to tie ourselves into this form of definition or to set businesses outside these provisions on that basis. The opposition is coming before the parliament with a suggestion to use the ABS definition of small business so that these provisions can still be targeted at the people whom we wish to help in total as a parliament. I hope the government will take these comments on board and treat them seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some criticism that members of the opposition have dwelt too much on retail tenancy matters. The provisions of the act which go to industry codes are to be applauded. I congratulate the government on making them part of this amending bill. I believe the committee quite adequately justified the need to have legislative underpinning of industry codes as part of the Trade Practices Act. Clearly, one of the most embarrassing aspects of the committee's inquiry was that nobody could come before the committee with an ironclad guarantee that voluntary codes without legislative underpinning had been a great success. That leads to several options. They can either be mandatory with legislative underpinning or they can take the form of an industry code&mdash;voluntary or otherwise&mdash;that has underpinning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn to an important retail tenancy matter which is affecting people in my elec 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11719"> torate. I am referring to the conduct of the Greensborough Plaza Shopping Centre. The Greensborough Plaza Shopping Centre has, over the last three or four years, undergone quite considerable redevelopment and expan sion. Two years ago, in August 1995, the first Myer store in Victoria was opened in 17 years. The Coles-Myer group in their wisdom decided that this would not be a full Myer store; it would be something less. Perhaps they had good commercial reasons for coming to the decision that this would succeed. But, regrettably, it was not what the customers wanted. There were no whitegoods. It was not seen to be a legitimate Myer store. It struggled for two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened? As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, in commercial circles rumours start. In shopping centres people talk: `Myer is going to close down.' There was discussion about what would go into the space. A couple of Fridays ago store&hyphen;holders at Greensborough Plaza picked up their copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> to find an article about the annual general meeting of Coles&hyphen;Myer the day before. The last paragraph of that article refers to the Chief Executive Officer of Coles&hyphen;Myer, Dennis Eck, who is under questioning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He conceded rumours of the closure of Greensborough Myer were true. It would be replaced by a baby Target and a new home department store.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Guess what arrived in my office by fax on the same Friday? A letter from Lend Lease, the managing company of Greensborough Plaza. That letter states inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Target store will replace the existing Myer store and comes as a result of extensive market research. This research highlighted the importance of value to the customer as well as the need to expand the centre's homewares offer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I hope their extensive market research was better than the market research that led them to believe that a Myer store would succeed. They do not have a really good track record for putting in place stores at Greensborough Plaza. On the same Friday, the other tenants at Greensborough Plaza were informed of the decision. I do not know whether I am too much into conspiracies when I suggest that it is coincidental that on the same Friday there 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was an article in the newspaper in respect of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not good enough. It is another example of a problem with retail tenancy. The rest of the traders at Greensborough Plaza are at the mercy of the big players. When the big players make a mistake and the centre management have to do something else, and when the big players, like Coles Myer, change the type of store that they are going to have and put in another competitor in direct competition with some of the smaller players, the smaller players have to lump it because they have nothing else to do. There is no sharing of the risk. There is no concept of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might have a store which sells homeware in Greensborough Plaza, you might be struggling and you cannot get rent relief. When it comes to renegotiating your rental and you say you are going bad, you are told by management, `That is too bad, that is your problem.' Now they are told that the Coles Myer group are going to put in another competitor or that Target&mdash;a discount store which is part of the Coles Myer group&mdash;is going to compete against them. Those risks are not shared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the opposition treats retail tenancy matters as important. That is why, in the absence of an indication&mdash;I am not even asking for a guarantee but an indication&mdash;that the government will look at the recommendations of the committee that suggest that there needs to be legislative underpinning of a rental tenancy code of such a type, the opposition will propose that we have it in the legislative function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We acknowledge that the bulk of retail tenancy legislation remains in the jurisdictions of the states and territories. We acknowledge that the Commonwealth has to go to the ministerial council and do the hard yards. The Trade Practices Act gives a lead. It underscores what the position should be. Those amendments should be supported. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating one element of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11720"> government's package entitled `New deal: fair deal'. It is the name given by the federal government to a whole range of changes to the relationship primarily between small business and large business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that all members of the House, no matter what side they are on, are aware of the  tensions and pressures that exist from time to time between small and large businesses. The honourable member for Bendigo, Bruce Reid, chaired a committee of this House that investigated the issue. It is probably the 18th or 19th time that small business has been looked at by this parliament, and so far it is the only report that has produced results. Unfortunately, and tragically, during the term of the Labor Party in office 17 reports were produced and not one of those reports&mdash;well intentioned as many of them were; some of them were not even well intentioned but just sought to give a political solution to put off the capacity to make a decision to support small business&mdash;produced a single result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the first occasion that something is done for small business in this House, the Labor Party members complain that it is not enough or it does not go in the direction that they would prefer it to go. They had 13 years and 17 reports within their own caucus&mdash;not being challenged in the parliament, not being challenged by the press, not being challenged by the small businesses of Australia&mdash;to develop policies and ideas and to produce legislation and results in this parliament. They were on this government side of the House and they did nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One must give credit to the former Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), for writing the terms of reference for the parliamentary committee which allowed it to go widely into the relationship between small and large businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee produced a report which covered tenancy; the relationship and protection for small and large businesses, particularly where small businesses were being preyed upon by large businesses; codes of conduct; franchising reform; access to justice for small 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> businesses; enforcement of justice; access to finance, which is a matter of great concern for small businesses in Australia at any time, but particularly in this day and age and right across this region as well; and the process for information and education for small business. A wide range of decisions has been taken by this government based on the Reid committee report and has been acted upon promptly by this federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new small business section of the Trade Practices Act prohibiting unconscionable conduct, similar to the strong protection which consumers already have, is being debated by the parliament tonight. As I have already said, despite the 13 years of trial runs and practice and no events and no results, the Australian Labor Party has come in with amendments to change things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sole purpose of the amendments proposed by the Australian Labor Party is to delay the progress of these vital amendments to the Trade Practices Act so small business will see no relief from the Australian parliament before the next election. That is the plan. That is the purpose. It is the same way they have handled unfair dismissal: to set it aside. In an area where every member of this House understands the significance of unfair dismissal and its impact on small business, so too does every member of this House understand the significance of this legislation for the small businesses of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Australian Labor Party takes this legislation into the Senate, opposes it in the Senate and seeks to subvert the progress of this significant legislation, I think it would be the most disgusting piece of political hypocrisy that I have seen in all my days in this parliament. You had 13 years and did nothing, and now you complain the moment somebody else does something and you want to block them from doing it. I cannot believe it. What incredible hypocrisy from the Australian Labor Party!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one comes to look at the details of what they are proposing, one must be more aghast. What they are saying in the first place is that the government should change the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11721"> main part of the amendment from `unconscionable conduct' to `unfair conduct'.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> whether, as a result of conduct engaged in by the supplier, the business consumer was required to comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the supplier; and</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes into whether coercion is created by an agent of the person creating a problem&mdash;a centre manager, for instance, seeking to put heat on a tenant on behalf of the property owner. It is all covered here in the process of what is unconscionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For members of the Australian Labor Party to claim that the detail of unconscionability is not adequate is a complete furphy. That is one reason why I say that they are seeking to delay this legislation rather than let small business have what it deserves&mdash;relief from the oppression that has been on them, the oppression identified by the Reid committee and which the Australian Labor Party is unwilling to rectify. If this legislation is so bad and so inadequate, why don't they let it pass and let us wear the criticism? But no, they want to hold it up&mdash;they do not want to let it pass&mdash;by debate, amendment and carry on in the Senate. That is what we will see. We will not see this through the House because that is their intention&mdash;not to let small business have their way but to slow down, block and obstruct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go on with some of the matters covered by the legislation, which states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the extent to which the supplier's conduct towards the business consumer was consistent with the supplier's conduct in similar transactions between the supplier and other like business consumers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is an excellent provision, which reflects the Robertson Patman amendment to the United States legislation. My friend opposite might care to learn this because that amendment covers behaviour in similar circumstances dealing with another person in a  similar business transaction. Here we have it.

<PARA STYLE="Para">He did not have to actually comply with the code under this legislation; it was his intention, or the person had a reasonable belief that he would comply with that code. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the extent to which the supplier unreasonably failed to disclose to the business consumer:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on and on. There are 10 subclauses here, one other after, lifted from the Reid report and embellished by careful examination of trade practices law around the world and within Australia. There we have it. Why would you want to amend or change that? Unconscionability is clearly spelt out. Although the government chose not to adopt the Reid committee's concept of unfair conduct, it accepted that a legislative response to fair trading issues was necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, the Trade Practices Act had been shown to be ineffective in addressing some of the small businesses' fair trading concerns. Self-regulation, for example, in the franchise sector had also been proven to be ineffective in cases where a large proportion of people in an industry refused to be bound by a franchise code of practice&mdash;and we are going to have that as a mandatory process. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They did nothing for 13 years but they agree to nearly all of it and commend to the government that what they are doing is spectacular and different. But they are just trying to delay, to frustrate and to hold back a significant proportion of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has decided to establish a new small business provision. I have read from section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act that builds on well understood consumer protections against unconscionable conduct to small businesses and provides further protection against some of the business conduct identified by the Reid committee. We introduced a new business provision rather than extend the coverage for consumer transactions to maintain a distinction between the rights of the consumer on the one hand and the rights of small business on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, we have limited the provision to transactions under $1 million that may involve unlisted businesses. The government believes that the new approach will not result in an unacceptable level of commercial uncertainty or unduly undermine contractual arrangements. It is based on established legal doctrine. That is the strength of it&mdash;it is established on a doctrine that is understood. There is already a body of case law on the protections available to the consumer against unconscionable conduct. The approach will also provide small businesses with the protections they need against a range of unfair business practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I emphasise to the House that the problems of concern to the government are not the product of ordinary competitive forces or commercial risk. The new small business provision is designed to induce behavioural change in dealings between large and small businesses and to ensure that commercial dealings are carried on on a more equitable basis. It balances the need for fair conduct in commercial relations with the need to maintain an open market and does this without compromising the basic principles of contractual relations and commercial risks which remain at the core of our free enterprise system and our free enterprise economy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11723">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some industry representatives have stated that there is a degree of uncertainty over exactly how the new business provisions will operate. Clearly, from the wording of our draft bill and the bill before the House, the basic definition of unconscionable conduct will be the same. A bargain will be deemed to be against conscience when one party is at a special disadvantage and the other party unconscionably takes advantage of the opportunity thus placed in his hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have dealt with all of the conditions. It is simple. There is an established legal practice.  We have lifted that out from the consumer and placed it into the small business area. We have added the Reid committee provisions and more&mdash;10 special conditions that may be considered by the court in deciding what is unconscionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a second matter that the Australian Labor Party wants to raise and object to&mdash;that is, the fact that there is no intention on the part of the government to have a uniform tenancy law in Australia. I would like to quote the Shadow Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Martin) when he was making his speech in the second reading debate. It was an interesting speech. If you go to the detail you will find the problem that the Australian Labor Party has not only in the area of tenancy but also in unconscionable conduct. The shadow minister says&mdash;and I think he was referring to the member for Bendigo:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As he knows, an opinion in a submission given by Mr Dennis Rose QC, on behalf of Blake Dawson Waldron, lawyers to one of the major lobbying and constituent groups in small business&mdash;the Motor Trades Association of Australia Ltd&mdash;to the committee and subsequently to the government categorically states that, constitutionally, it is possible to bring down a uniform retail tenancy law which can be underpinned by changes to the Trade Practices Act, which will give effect to this implementation of a uniform retail tenancy code. The opposition will seek to do that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I looked at the submissions to the Motor Trades Association of Australia and found Mr Dennis Rose's submission. Mr Rose proposes in part 4 of his letter to Mr Delaney:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the States the Commonwealth's powers are limited to laws with respect to the subjects listed in the Constitution. They are found mainly in section 51.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, the Commonwealth's powers are related to trading or financial corporations and where the lessee has a trading or financial corporation. It seems to me that here is a test: is the matter going to be dealt with by the Australian Labor Party for tenancy? Can they apply the powers of the Commonwealth only to corporations? Of course, Mr Dennis Rose says, yes, that the only thing they can apply to is corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then he goes on to say, `Well, you must have everybody incorporated if you're going to have uniform tenancy rules.' So how does he suggest the Australian Labor Party or the Motor Trades Association get people to incorporate? He suggests that they force them to incorporate by having a tax surcharge on those who do not incorporate. What a ridiculous thing. In order to get your way in some perverse and stupid manner, you are going to pass laws in this parliament which are going to tax more heavily the businesses of dads and mums, the partnerships, the sole traders and the trusts if they do not form themselves into an incorporated body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is Mr Rose's opinion. You are saying that Mr Rose's opinion is the one that should be followed by the Australian Labor Party. That is the one you want to see through in the Senate. I can say that that is a ridiculous proposition. If it is your intention to force the partnerships, the sole traders and the trusts of Australia to pay a higher tax or be forced to incorporate, then that is a ridiculous proposition. If you are putting that one to the Australian parliament but not saying so, then I would have to say that you deserve all the criticism that you are going to get for that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: what you are seeking to do is to treat this legislation like the unfair dismissal legislation. All you want to do is obstruct, delay and prevent the government from moving legislation through this House and through the Senate that will be of benefit to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11724"> both the small businesses of Australia and the people employed by the small businesses of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the objective of the Australian Labor Party: it is obstruction and delay. You do not wish to see these changes to the Trade Practices Act, which will make things fairer for small business, which will give small business better opportunity and provide small business with an opportunity not thought of, not dreamed of and not acted on by the Labor Party for 13 years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who has sacked thousands of Canberra workers and led our community into a recession&mdash;a recession boasted about by his colleague in the Senate, something the Prime Minister has yet to publicly denounce, to my knowledge. He has failed to defend the ACT against Senator Campbell. He has failed to defend us against the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) and others in their attacks on this community. He refuses to live here. He is planning to hold his office staff Christmas party in Sydney. Yet all of a sudden tonight on the ABC he declares an interest in defending us from what he thinks could be native title claims on residential leases in the ACT. What hypocrisy and how totally mischievous!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what the Prime Minister actually said tonight. In answer to a question relating to freehold and backyards, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So it is not only freehold but it is also commercial leases, residential leases. I mean the sort of leases people have here in Canberra, for example, fall into the category of exclusive possession tenures but they are not freehold. Now the High Court in the Wik case said that they are all in the same category.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The interview went on with the interviewer saying:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And are you suggesting that if somebody took out a native title claim on a suburban backyard in Canberra it has a genuine chance of success in the High Court?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kerry, I don't think it has, I don't believe it has but why not go the extra step and make certain that it doesn't happen.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why make certain something that will not occur? This is scaremongering. It is sensationalism. And the cleverness&mdash;or, should I say, the sneakiness&mdash;of his words: `there probably isn't a problem but let's legislate to be sure' and `I don't think it has, I don't believe it has but why not just in case'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian constitution&mdash;I believe it is in section 125&mdash;established, as we all know, the requirement for a national capital. Around 1912 that process eventually began and over proceeding years land was acquired by the Crown. Vast tracts of the now ACT which were New South Wales freehold were seized back by the Commonwealth over that time. The development of the ACT had commenced, and a range of leases were issued, including residential leases. In fact, the vast majority of leases in the ACT are residential leases, obviously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACT residential lease is an absolute right of the lessee to the enjoyment of the land to the exclusion of all others apart from its landlord&mdash;that is, the Territory. As such, these leases fall fairly into the definition used in Wik for the types of interests that would extinguish native title. There is, of course, vacant land, unleased land, which may be subject to native title claims if there is no lease over it. Some claims have, in fact, been lodged and negotiations are proceeding, and I do not recall any hysteria pervading this community as a result. However, I repeat: it is mischievous, in fact desperate, of the Prime Minister to attempt to throw into doubt the security of residential leases in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This behaviour is outrageous, it is unacceptable and I ask the basic question: why raise a problem when the problem does not exist in the first place? It seems to me that this Prime Minister and his government are desperate to continue to throw red herrings of any kind at anybody's cost across the trail of the Wik

However, Charleville is the epicentre of the problems presented by the Native Title Act and the justice of a fair resolution&mdash;if such a goal is achievable. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been to Charleville. I remember it was very hot and it was dry. I also recall that the poor health and existential despair of Aboriginal people was matched only by the drought stricken malaise gripping the entire community, especially those struggling to survive and make a living on the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not yet met Peter Wales, the parish priest from Charleville's All Saints Anglican Church, but I hope to one day. During the recent emotion charged attack on the government's proposed amendments to the Native Title Act by a number of church leaders, Reverend Wales put the entire issue into perspective with a clarity I had not previously heard. What he had sought to courageously do was to give Australians an understanding of the needs and circumstances of both Aboriginal people and pastoralists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having told him that I had reminded this House that `however noble the cause, 220 years of European property law cannot easily be unravelled and our responsibility is as much to the future as it is to reconciliation of the past', Reverend Wales wrote me a letter, and he said that I may use the letter in any form that I felt appropriate. I would like to read just a couple of passages from the letter which he wrote to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first duty of love is to listen. One of the most important parts of my ministry as an Anglican priest is simply listening . . . We cannot resolve the crimes of the past by creating new injustices now, so what can be done that will bring healing now without creating division and ill&hyphen;will in the future? 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians who make their living on the land face tremendous insecurity and hardship. People in my parish have faced fires, two major floods, and possibly the worst drought in living memory, all within the last seven years. This marginalised and frequently impoverished group of people is now being asked to carry the burden of reconciliation in a way that most church leaders, politicians and city people would find intolerable. Asking a marginalised minority to accept a burden they will not carry themselves, is unjust and un&hyphen;Australian. Whatever the solution to the present crisis may be&mdash;and our response to the needs of indigenous people should be both swift and generous&mdash;it will not involve asking families in the country to bear alone a cost that is owed by every Australian.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The most important part of this debate about native title&mdash;personally I think there are only half&hyphen;a&hyphen;dozen people in the entire country who fully understand it&mdash;is that it seems to be as complex as it is unpredictable. But what seems to have been missing is a genuine attempt by those who represent the interests and needs of pastoralists, miners and petroleum explorers to fully understand the injustices, the dispossession and the maltreatment of indigenous people in past generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, equally, some of those who have sought to represent indigenous people have failed to meaningfully understand the circumstances faced by those who are struggling to survive on the land, who are responsible for the creation of a not inconsiderable amount of wealth in this country, which we as a government distribute to those with neither power nor influence, whether they be black or white.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to another person's point of view is a great risk. I suggest to the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) that he do just that. You run the risk of acquiring a deeper understanding. You might even change your mind. What you need to do, my friend, is to listen to those who work and live on the land and know what it is like to go out and shoot drought-stricken ewes every day and wonder whether your husband is going to shoot himself as much as you need to understand the impoverishment of Aboriginal people. Whatever else this nation achieves, if there is no improvement to the health and living standards of Aboriginal people, nothing will have been achieved and certainly not by your insincerity, my friend.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to bring to light how the selfish actions of the telecommunications carrier Vodafone Australia have dramatically affected a small pocket of my electorate over the last few days. I know the subject of mobile phone towers violating our residential landscape is not a new one. I appreciate that there is an unfortunate need for mobile phone bases to be located in our suburbs if we are to enjoy the fruits of mobile telecommunication in this country. Nevertheless, I think the residents of my electorate have a legitimate grievance in this case. They have been let down by governments&mdash;and I mean all gov ernments&mdash;and they have been seriously taken advantage of by big business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Late last year Vodafone Australia alerted Fairfield City Council&mdash;which is the local government body covering</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the majority of my electorate&mdash;to its intentions to erect a new mobile phone tower in the suburb of Abbotsbury. Council was against the idea for two reasons, one being that residents already had to contend with four large towers in the immediate area, an arrangement which provided more than enough opportunity for carriers like Vodafone to `co&hyphen;locate' their services as opposed to building a completely new tower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason was that the area pinpointed by Vodafone for its proposed tower is adjacent to where the equestrian and mountain bike events will be held during the Sydney Olympics. It was council's view that placing another tower near the sites would create an additional eyesore for tourists and spectators alike. It was for these reasons that council formally rejected Vodafone's proposal and suggested it make alternative arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vodafone, for its part, disagreed with council's decision and signalled its intentions to proceed with its development.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Members may notice that at no time have I said Vodafone actually sought council's `approval' for its actions; merely it `signalled' its intentions. It did not do so because under 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth law it is unnecessary for it to do so. I will return to this point in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Thursday last week, without prior notice and without informing nearby residents, a number of trucks, cranes and workmen arrived at a property owned by Sydney Water in Abbotsbury and began constructing a 35&hyphen;metre high mobile phone tower. By Saturday it was finished. Like a thief in the night, Vodafone Australia had ridden roughshod over the concerns and feelings of local residents and had completely disregarded the opposition to the tower by the local council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why was Vodafone able&mdash;quite legally and legitimately&mdash;to act in the outrageous way it has? The answer can be found in the Telecommunications Act of 1991. Under the act companies like Vodafone are merely required to notify and consult with local government bodies prior to erecting their towers. They do not need to seek or to gain actual building approval from the council. Strangely enough, this state of affairs will continue only until December 31 this year, when a grandfather clause in the act comes into effect, requiring normal council building approval before developments such as these are begun. This explains Vodafone's mad rush to get this latest tower up and working before the deadline hit. While this may be true, the people of Abbotsbury will find little solace in this quirk of the legislation. I for one during that period of time never realised that it existed in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The residents of Abbotsbury expected that the sometimes infuriating but necessary levels of bureaucracy which usually surround building approvals on this scale&mdash;which would apply to them if they wanted to build anything in their backyards&mdash;also applied to Vodafone. They were wrong. The residents of Abbotsbury might not be able to build something in their backyards without council approval but Vodafone Australia certainly was able to. This is an inadequacy in the act which should never have been approved. It was a mistake of the former government to let it pass. It has allowed insensitive and profit hungry multinationals like Vodafone Australia, which is, incidentally, worth $2.8 billion at the present time, to come into our commu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11727"> nities, scar our neighbourhoods and upset people's peace of mind with impunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vodafone's callous and inflexible attitude to this issue deserves strong condemnation. When a constituent of mine rang the company today to inquire about the tower she was all but told to bug off. Vodafone may have initially consulted with council over its plans, but rather than take its reservations on board, rather than work with the community and council to arrive at a solution which was acceptable to all parties, it threw the problem in the too hard basket and took the easy way out. Vodafone may have legally been in the right to take this course of action, but I believe it was morally wrong. Vodafone Australia has proven itself an unworthy  corporate citizen and its actions do its reputation no service in my community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for Sydney Water's role in this sorry episode, I was informed by a representative from Vodafone Australia today that it has over 100 of the company's towers situated on its property around Sydney. As a former New South Wales state government minister with responsibility for the Water Board, or Sydney Water, as it is now known, I find it difficult to imagine how a minister could give blanket approval for these sorts of goings&hyphen;on without consideration of how that would affect local residents and their neighbourhoods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad that, come 1 January next year, this situation will not be able to be repeated but, as I said, this will bring little comfort to the people of Abbotsbury. Nor will it bring comfort to the unfortunate people elsewhere in metropolitan Australia who may find themselves, without warning, living under mobile phone towers by the end of this month as telecommunications carriers rush to build their towers under deadline and with complete and absolute freedom. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="11727"><TITLE>Redcliffe and District Cardiac Rehabilitation Support Group</TITLE>

It may only be a group of 150 residents on the Redcliffe peninsula, it may have only a small budget, it may not be widely known throughout this place or even the Petrie electorate as a whole, but it does have something special&mdash;it has the commitment and strength of many. The group has the determination to ensure that the valuable assistance already provided will continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ln the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Redcliffe and Bayside Herald</EMPHASIS> of 19 November 1997, there was a story of a man called Norman Hoefler, who used the services of the cardiac rehabilitation group two years ago following a heart attack. The article reflected on the support, friendship, guidance and motivation provided by the group that was invaluable in his rehabilitation. When Norman first joined the group, he could walk only 10 metres but, with the help of the cardiac rehabilitation group, he is now able to walk a kilometre at a time. The cardiac rehabilitation project has a commitment to improve the lifestyles of others and has been recognised with many national and state awards for its efforts in helping people with cardiac conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nearly 30 per cent of the Redcliffe peninsula's population is aged 55 or over, a high percentage for any community in Australia. These types of support groups are not just a gymnasium but a network of people all sharing common health goals and objectives. Earlier this year I went to the opening of the group's gymnasium at Redcliffe hospital which now plays a vital part in the patients rehabilitation process. During the visit, I was able to see the important role that this group plays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The group's present situation follows the decision by the Division of General Practice to extend the project until only 31 December this year. The funding problems for this program have come at a time when the funding for the Division of General Practice 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11728"> for the next financial year has actually increased. There have been some reports and speculation that federal funding to the cardiac rehabilitation group has been cut. This is not entirely true as the funding to the Division of General Practice, which will provide the impetus for the program, will actually increase over the next financial year. It is indeed up to the division to decide how the money should be allocated within its area&mdash;not a simple process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a pity that this group of people at Redcliffe has been caught up in this whole situation of politics. I have met with those involved in the cardiac rehabilitation program, I have spoken with representatives from the Division of General Practice about the funding situation and I have been in contact with  the Queensland Minister for Health, the Hon.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are part of history being made tonight. As we watch the debate in the Senate this evening, it is of great significance to note the way that the native title amendment legislation is moving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember well&mdash;as, I am sure, do many other members of this House&mdash;the period in late 1993 when the original Mabo legislation was passed. I also remember very well the discussion and negotiation between many members of the then government and the various interests that were involved. I remember the difficulty that we faced in trying to choose and to judge where the balance should be&mdash;what was fair and what was not&mdash;and the responsibility that was placed on us as members of the government of Australia to make a decision and a judgment that was not only simply valid in law and just in terms of morality and our history but would also build a basis for the years ahead.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have sensed this evening and this week the same sense of occasion but not the same sense of concern. I have this feeling that many members of the current government are caught between a rock and a hard place. We are watching at the moment not an honest, open negotiation between the government and the community but a series of subterfuges which are deceptive, misleading and very dangerous as to where they will take this country. The idea that somehow anybody in this House should take lightly the position of any Australian is untenable. We all represent a tremendously diverse range of people in terms of employment, backgrounds, capacity, experiences and what we bring to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea that somehow there is them and us&mdash;that one side of the House takes one point of view and the other side automatically opposes it&mdash;I have never found to be either valid or appropriate, except that I do recall in 1993 the comments made by the then Leader of the Opposition after that legislation was carried that it was a day of shame. Those words still ring very strongly with me because that is how he and many of his colleagues saw the original native title legislation and last week, this week and tonight we have seen an echoing of a day of shame being unwound, reversed and untwisted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of that process, we had the deception last night about the 79 per cent&mdash;I do not know how many people actually saw the live <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> of not so long ago when that map was held up for the first time and felt the shock and horror that I felt that a Prime Minister was prepared to do that. I say that because I have on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> this week a question to the Prime Minister asking him what the 79 per cent consists of, because no&hyphen;one I have asked can actually tell me who they are and where they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the privilege last week of talking to a woman from a pastoral lease. As I was talking to her about access and whether or not it was reasonable, she said, `Actually, we have great access. We haven't got a problem,' but her landlord was the Sultan of Brunei. Perhaps he understands what native title 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11729"> means. Like many others, I have been trying to find out for some months who are the 79 per cent who are potentially able to be vetoed by Aborigines. Are they Australians? How many people are involved? There appears to be something like 7,000 to 9,000 leases only, and one does not know how many people and how many are offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the issues. Rather than talking about maps, we really should be talking about who we are representing here and what we are doing it for. Native title rarely provides exclusive occupancy. It is a shared title, as we understand. The community may not.

There was evidence of malnutrition in the records held on him by the Department of Family Services. This absolutely devastated me. It was the first time I had encountered such a background in the whole of my association with Cherbourg. That association goes back to 1983. It is true that I was paid for my work there on most occasions, but there were quite a few times that I appeared because Aboriginal people needed my help and Legal Aid was not prepared to fund legal representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I entered parliament because of injustice, too. However, at times I feel I was achieving much more at the bar. At least there you can win about half the time. On the other hand, this place is pregnant with injustice. Child support is a massive area that I want to tackle. Aboriginal affairs is another. Anyone who has read my speeches about native title will realise that I believe native title is no way ahead to improve the lot of Aborigines in this country. It will retard progress. In my view, it has already. Since the Native Title Act was passed by the former Labor government, more than $210 million has been spent on native title claims and associated matters. Where has it gone? Mostly to lawyers, advisers and the many other people who are living comfortable lives on the native title payroll. That is why I say it is a sham, an illusion and a big con, where most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will not get a thing out of it. It has divided this country into white and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. I have kept saying it and I will say it again: I have never seen more division in this country since the notion of reconciliation and native title came to the fore. That is not good for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week in the Senate the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Faulkner, said that my statements about native title were pig ignorance. Far from it, Senator Faulkner. It is part of the obscenity that he, Keating, Lavarch, Kernot and Pearson designed in the discred 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11730"> ited Native Title Act. There has been $210 million to the native title industry; zilch of that has gone to the malnourished, homeless kids. Senator Faulkner selectively quoted my comments about native title in my newsletter to my constituents of Dickson. He referred to me as `the member for Dickson, that paragon of moral rectitude'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to state my agreement with a number of general propositions. First, it is off limits for members of parliament to reflect on personal matters of other members. Secondly, parliament should not be used to improperly air personal grievances. Personal relationships are highly complex. Those between intimates are sacrosanct in a public sense. Thirdly, there is a clear lesson for all parliamentarians that hypocrisy never pays. Fourthly, if you fire off a cheap, gratuitous shot, of course it comes back to haunt you later. They mean nothing  and they catch up with you in the end. Those statements were made, inter alia, by Senator Faulkner in commenting on former Senator Woods on 5 February 1997 at page 200 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Senate Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Senator Faulkner has had his cheap shot at me. Senator Faulkner has made a personal judgment on my morality. Heeding his words, I choose not to take this opportunity to pass any judgment on his.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="11730"><TITLE>Aircraft Noise: Flight Paths in Sydney</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter that was dealt with in question time today in a question from the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey). It concerns the soon to be introduced new flight paths in respect of Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney. The honourable member asserted that the new flight paths, which I acknowledge he has been deeply involved in the design of, were going to realise the government's ambition to more fairly distribute aircraft movements over the Sydney basin and would lead to an equitable outcome for the area, acknowledging that aircraft always make noise and the airport will always have its environmental downside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to take this opportunity to put to the House what has actually happened since the government's last attempt to bring in new flight paths. That occurred in May of last 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> year. During the period since that date we have had the opportunity to review the flight paths for some 16 months. It is noteworthy that, in respect of the noisiest operations, that is, take&hyphen;offs from Kingsford Smith airport, during that period there has been a quite remarkable&mdash;indeed, quite dramatic&mdash;increase in the number of take&hyphen;offs to the north, to the east and the west, but in all respects over residential areas. That increase in that period amounts to some 55 per cent over the number of take&hyphen;offs over residential areas in the preceding 16&hyphen;month period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electorate, and the people of Sydney, who are always concerned about aircraft noise, should be aware, as I think they would be because they hear these planes, that there are now 55 per cent more take&hyphen;offs over their homes on average than was the case in the preceding period. The potential tragedy is that, if one of these planes is to come down&mdash;heaven forbid&mdash;there is a much greater likelihood of it being over a house, a preschool or a school than would be the case if the take&hyphen;offs were over the waters of Botany Bay. So not only are they noisier; there is a greater potential risk, and this is a very considerable downside of the new arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been delays in the shipment of medical radioisotopes. During the last major maintenance shut&hyphen;down of the High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR) (September to December 1995) Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) imported a range of radioisotopes. ANSTO has confirmed that there were significant delays on a number of occasions, and the activity of some shipments had decayed to levels that left the product useless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delays are caused by factors such as unscheduled transshipment at intermediate stopping points, and the effects of international and national air transport regulations. Where a package experiences a transport disruption, this usually results in the carrier delivering it at least 24 hours later than scheduled. ANSTO has imported some radioisotope products since the last major shut&hyphen;down of HIFAR and has advised that delays have continued to occur.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are international fora that emerge from time to time and Australia does use these opportunities to promote its approach to and successes with landcare and with sustainable natural resource management generally. The most important of these fora at this time is in the ongoing negotiations to ratify and implement the International Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Expe 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> riencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa. Australia is also participating in the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development and in the activities for promoting sustainable development carried out by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia does benefit from this participation. The Convention to Combat Desertification provides an opportunity to promote the export of Australian technology and expertise, and the approach promoted by the Convention draws heavily on Australia's experience with the community based landcare movement. Technologies that have been promoted through landcare include remote sensing, drought management, geographical information systems, sustainable agriculture techniques and practices, and also technology aimed at improving communication and energy efficiency such as wind and solar electricity generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the work of the OECD provides an ongoing and important opportunity for Australia to encourage the removal of agricultural support mechanisms used by overseas countries that are environmentally damaging to those countries themselves and that limit the potential for improved agricultural trade by Australia. I also expect that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11741"> landcare and sustainable agriculture will be receiving further international attention in the context of Australia's response to the management of greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will also have an excellent opportunity to promote landcare at the proposed International Landcare Conference, to be held in Melbourne in the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Efforts to promote landcare internationally need to take into account the extent to which landcare reflects Australian cultural, social, economic and agricultural conditions. Much of landcare's success so far derives from the targeting of decision making by land managers and of managing continuing change through continued learning. These issues can be very culturally specific, involving aspects such as land ownership and land management responsibilities and relationships, educational arrangements and access, and the social structures of rural communities. The factors that are critical to the success of landcare therefore need to be understood if the landcare model is to be transferable to other countries.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) All allegations reported to Centrelink are investigated, providing the person about whom the allegations are being made can be identified as a past or present customer, and appropriate action taken.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The South Australian Country Fire Service (SACFS), as the Contractor employed by AusAID, used two Air Tractor (AT 802) aircraft for aerial fire bombing in Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The two aircraft were engaged by SACFS from Australian Maritime Resources Pty Ltd, which owns the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Aircraft of a slightly smaller capacity (AT 502) have been used regularly for firefighting in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) On average, 300 hours have been flown annually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The cost is $2000 per aircraft per standby day, and $1200 per hour for operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Contract for the aerial water bombing in Indonesia was between the SACFS and the Commonwealth represented by AusAID. The Commonwealth will reimburse the SACFS for the costs associated with use of the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The final costs have not been resolved but the estimated cost is $539 000 comprising $110 000 for ferrying the aircraft, $325 000 for operations and $104 000 for the time the aircraft were on standby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The hourly cost for an aircraft is $1 500 per flying hour, inclusive of fuel, and $2 000 per day while on standby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) EMA was approached by AusAID for information on the availability of Australian&hyphen;based aerial water bombing assets following a request from the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs. EMA was not requested for advice in relation to the suitability and cost effectiveness for operations in Indonesia; however, advice was obtained by AusAID from Australian fire authorities which indicated that the Australian aircraft would be suitable for operations against small scale spot fires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) The 1994 review of firefighting included a recommendation to `Broaden AFAC's (Australasian Fire Authorities Council) position paper on "Use of Aircraft in Firebombing in Australia" to further detail a position of the role of aircraft covering all 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> operational applications during wildfires.' Subsequently, a revised position paper was endorsed by AFAC and has provided a non&hyphen;mandatory basis on which rural fire agencies have employed firebombing aircraft. The 1994 review does not provide a definitive basis for deciding on the suitability of such aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The understanding of EMA is that firebombing can be carried out using a range of aircraft types, and involves the dropping of water, retardant or foam mixtures on to fires burning in natural fuels. For firebombing to be efficient and effective, it is important that the most suitable aircraft types be chosen; that competent aviation management personnel direct the firebombing operations; that effective ground support and administration systems are in place; and air operations are effectively integrated into the total fire organisation. While such aircraft are suitable in many situations, as has been demonstrated with the softwood forests in Canada, they are not necessarily appropriate for direct attack on major Australian hardwood conflagrations burning at extreme intensities. In these cases, other less direct approaches are required, such as suppressing spot fires caused by wind&hyphen;borne embers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) All firefighting authorities in Australia, including South Australia, support the AFAC position paper `Use of Aircraft for Fire Bombing in Australia'. The EMA assessment is based on this position paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) The contract between AusAID and the SACFS was on a cost&hyphen;recovery basis only, with no net financial benefit accruing to the SACFS. The Government is not aware of any benefit or gain which would accrue to the company National Jetstream. I am advised that this company was not involved in the Indonesian aerial water bombing operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12) While the fire danger season in areas of South Australia commences on 1 November, aerial bombing cover does not commence until 1 December. As the SACFS contract ended on 2 November, the relocation of the aircraft to Indonesia did not threaten South Australian firefighting capability. If anything, it made both SACFS and Australian Maritime Resources better prepared for the forthcoming season.</PARA>
