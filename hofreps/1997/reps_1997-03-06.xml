<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1996, No. 277, made under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, there is no doubt that this proposal, the first tranche of which has come before the House today for consideration, represents nothing less than an absolute betrayal. It represents a betrayal of Queensland; it represents a betrayal of tourism operators in Far North Queensland; it represents a betrayal of the Australian tourism industry; it represents a betrayal of the thousands of workers who are currently employed in the tourism industry in Queensland and, might I say, more generally in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The term `betrayal' is one that is often used in parliamentary debates, but I do not use it lightly. I use it on this occasion for the simple reason that the government has betrayed those constituents who supported them at the last election. There is no doubt that one of the major reasons that led to the support which was given to coalition candidates during the last election campaign in North Queensland was the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and the government now in this country, went to the people of North Queensland with cast&hyphen;iron guarantees about taxes,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about surcharges, and about their support for the Queensland tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The now government went to the people of North Queensland in support of the members for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), Herbert (Mr Lindsay), Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly), Capricornia (Mr Marek) and Hinkler (Mr Neville) in particular, the candidates for the Liberal and National parties in the last election, and said to the people of North Queensland, `Read my lips: there will be no new taxes, there will be no new increases in existing taxes if you elect us to Canberra.' Indeed, the Prime Minister, as Leader of the Opposition, took himself to Cairns and told the people of Cairns and North Queensland, particularly those in the tourism industry, that that industry was paramount. He told them that there would be no increased taxes in the tourism industry; he told them that he believed the tourism industry was vital for Australia's economic future; he told them that he, if made Prime Minister, would ensure that the jobs of young people and those people in the tourism industry more generally would be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What humbug! What absolute garbage! What have we seen? As I have said, we have seen betrayal. The member for Leichhardt will participate in this debate, and I am pleased that he will do so because the member for Leichhardt is a pretty honourable sort of a bloke. He has fought long and hard for his constituents in Cairns and for the reef operators. I have spoken to them, and they have told me that he has told them that he has come down here to Canberra and has spoken on their behalf. Behind the scenes he has probably done a bit of lobbying with ministers at different times to try to get across a point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, my friend, at the end of the day it is still a sell&hyphen;out. The fact that the government has decided to break the 500 per cent increase in the reef tax into two components is still a sell&hyphen;out. The component we are debating today will increase the environmental management charge or reef tax from $1 to $2. That will be incorporated in the cost of the ticket. It will be on the face of that ticket so
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2150"> there will be some transparency and people will know that that will apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In nine or 10 months time the second tranche of this is to come in. A new tourism charge will be levied on any person who goes and uses the facilities on the Great Barrier Reef. That tourism charge will be set at $4. It is a charge that does not exist now; it did not exist under us&mdash;there was no consideration of it existing under us. It is another tax, a tax on people from around Australia and around the world who are attracted to North Queensland because of its magnificent coastline, because of the Great Barrier Reef, because of the facilities that have been put in place by not only marine operators but also others in the tourism industry. It will certainly earn for Australia considerable sums of funds in export dollars. Most importantly, it will underpin jobs in North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do you think people will respond when, in 12 months time, for each visit to the reef, included in the cost of their ticket will be a $2 charge that the government has put on them as this reef tax? That is the first component. But then, as they walk down Trinity Wharf to get on a boat to go out to the Great Barrier Reef there will be a tax collector from GBRMPA, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, with their hand out and a stamp, saying, `That will be $4, please, for every trip you make out to the reef.' So, if you go out on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quicksilver</EMPHASIS> one day, and on another day you go out on another boat, and on another day you go scuba diving, and on another day you go on an aircraft to have a look at the reef, every time you will be slugged that increase of 500 per cent in the reef tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members we dubbed last year as the gang of five, who would not debate this and who represent those North Queensland electorates&mdash;the members for Leichhardt, Herbert, Dawson, Capricornia and Hinkler&mdash;should go and tell their constituents next year, when this 500 per cent increase has actually come in, what effect this is going to have on their tourism industry. You go and tell the small business proprietors, whom you purport to represent in this place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister comes in every day, Minister&mdash;as you know&mdash;and talks about small business and about how you will help small business. A great help to small business is a 500 per cent increase in the reef tax. Thanks very much. They must be cheering John Howard up in Cairns and Mackay. I see the member for Dawson up there. She must be really jumping up and down with delirium today because the Prime Minister is not only going to oversee a 500 per cent increase in the reef tax, but isn't there something about the sugar tariff as well that affects the honourable member's electorate? I also saw one of the newspapers today quoting I think the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) as saying he was going to cross the floor on the sugar tariffs. Minister, I have heard that before. I also read before in some of the local newspapers up in Far North Queensland about the gang of five saying, `If this 500 per cent increase in the reef tax comes in we'll have to cross the floor.' Well, my good friends, here is your big chance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, when we tried to bring on debate in this place about the reef tax and the detrimental effect it would have on employment and the tourism industry in North Queensland, you wimped out. You all said,`This is a technical motion. We're not going to support that. It's just a stunt by the opposition to try to bring the matter up for consideration.' Some stunt! If standing up for the jobs of young people in North Queensland and for the small businesses that run tourism activities in North Queensland is a stunt, then we stand condemned. If we are in this place trying to defend them and we are accused of just putting on some sort of a stunt, my hand is up: I am guilty. That is exactly what I am doing. I am defending Queenslanders&mdash;and I am from New South Wales. I am in here defending Queenslanders when the Queensland members of the National and Liberal parties should be on this side voting with this motion to disallow this first tranche.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, in this whole debate, we find that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has remained somewhat silent on this. Every time I have put questions to him in this place on the reef tax he has
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2151"> said, `It is not my area. You are directing it to the wrong person.' We used to call John Moore `Mirrors' because every time you asked him something he said, `I'll look into it.' Now we are going to call him `Gunna'. He has moved on from being Mirrors `I'll look into it,' to Gunna `I'm gunna do something about it.' But he has not. This is the man who is supposed to represent the tourism industry&mdash;but he wimps out. He says, `That is not my area. That's the Minister for the Environment's responsibility.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My very good friend the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) over here represents the Minister for the Environment in this place. Regrettably, it is a very difficult task for you today. You have to come in here, Minister, and follow me and justify why you said to the people of North Queensland there would be no increases in taxes and charges and that certainly any existing ones would not be increased. You have increased charges; you have done that with the reef tax. And it is not only the reef tax: when you look into the statutory rules we are debating today there are increases in another seven charges and taxes, everything from pontoon charges through to floating hotels&mdash;although there isn't one anymore. You have jacked the tax up. Do you know something that we do not? Do you think there is going to be another floating hotel coming to the Great Barrier Reef? Are you just getting ready to welcome them? `Welcome to North Queensland. We want infrastructure up here, so we'll bring in another floating hotel. By the way, we've just increased the charges for you being there.' Pontoon charges have gone up too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They snuck these charges through and they told no&hyphen;one about them. The interesting thing is that the minister for tourism, who is supposed to be promoting Australia's tourism, sits back, scratching his head, and says, `It's not really my area. It is the Minister for the Environment who has done this.' He didn't know anything about it either. When this came in as a budget measure, not only was there no consultation with the tourism industry in North Queensland&mdash;and they were a bit upset about that&mdash;but the minister for tourism
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> did not know about it. The member for Dawson gave him up. She was quoted in a local newspaper as saying that not even John Moore, the minister for tourism, knew about the 500 per cent increase in the reef tax. Of course, after the event, my good friend the minister for tourism came in here and said, `That was a decision taken by other ministers. I had nothing to do with it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, we are the first to admit we put in place the $1 levy on people who used the reef. The money was to go to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority so that we could see scientific work continue there. We did not have a problem with that. We put that in place and it was very transparent. What we did not do was cut the funding to GBRMPA as well. There has been a 3.2 per cent cut in funds to GBRMPA and, as a tawdry attempt to make up the funding for it, Robert Hill, the Minister for the Environment, comes in and says, `We'll have a 500 per cent increase in the reef tax and we will increase these seven other taxes as well. That way we'll be able to divert some of the funds to GBRMPA.' Don't hold your breath. I would not think too much of that extra money was going to be sent to GBRMPA. Not only is it not going to be given to GBRMPA to enable them to carry on the good work that they do but we have also had people talking about privatising the marine aquarium up in Townsville as one way of trying to find money to give to GBRMPA. The aquarium is one of it's major attractions. There was a huge split in the gang of five when these suggestions emanating from North Queensland were made, as I recall in a very secret document that was not so secret and which, regrettably, had the member for Leichhardt's fingerprints all over it. It is no longer secret, is it? No, because too many people found out about it. What the honourable member did was slip it around and say, `Get rid of the aquarium in Townsville. Sell it off. Great idea.' The member for Herbert, who represents Townsville and who is not here, is also one of the great reef tax advocates and he got a bit upset about that. We know that he got a bit upset about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyway, I was talking about my good friend, the minister for tourism&mdash;and this is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2152"> the tip: whether you are in government or in opposition, always carefully think about what you say and what you write, because at some stage it may come back to bite you on the hand.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He does. I am always cognisant of your presence, Mr Speaker; that is why my language is always moderated. The minister for tourism now, who was the shadow minister for industry, commerce and public administration, wrote to the President of the Independent Boat Owners Association on 23 May 1995. What did he say? He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your recent correspondence regarding the introduction of an environment management charge or reef tax. I appreciate you writing to me on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I'll bet he did! To continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to assure you that the Liberal Party is opposed to the introduction of an environment management charge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the minister for tourism now, writing to constituents&mdash;actually writing to Townsville people&mdash;saying they are opposed to it. Then it is introduced in here, now there is a 500 per cent increase proposed and this is the first tranche of it. How did the people of Queensland respond to the good old minister for tourism about this? I could say it no more eloquently than the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS>  of 24 November 1996, in an editorial entitled `Jobless pay'. It was about the reef tax proposal and it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reef tax, even in its watered down form&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is this grubby little deal that has been negotiated here, now with the $1 increase this time and the $4 next time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is simply ludicrous.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dead right there. It went to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every few thousand dollars the reef tax raises will put another young school leaver out of work, destroying job opportunities that might have otherwise arisen, had the tourist industry been encouraged, not nobbled.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And then, interestingly, this comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have had few Ministers for Tourism in Canberra&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is Queenslanders, of course, and John Moore, the minister for tourism, is a Queenslander. You would not know it&mdash;this is an anti&hyphen;Queensland tax. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS>  said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have had few Ministers for Tourism in Canberra and that such an imposition should be introduced with a Queenslander in the job is an outrage.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Some others were a little less charitable than that&mdash;some of the people in the tourism industry when referring to the introduction of this, in the first instance. Steve Moon, the general manager of Ocean Spirit Cruises and spokesman for the Cairns based marine tourism industry, whom the member for Leichhardt knows well, attacked the incompetence of Senator Hill when this proposal first surfaced and said in a press release on 6 November:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are calling on the Prime Minister to intervene in this issue, not only to resolve it once and for all, but also to maintain his own integrity after promising the industry in Cairns it would not happen. It is imperative that Senator Hill be asked to surrender his portfolio to a more competent and efficient member of government to maintain any credibility for any future negotiations that may be required with industry. The feeling is that this time the government cannot be trusted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I did not say that. This is a tourism operator in the member for Leichhardt's electorate speaking on behalf of people about this anti&hyphen;Queensland, anti&hyphen;jobs, anti&hyphen;tourism tax that is being introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just know the arguments that are going to come: `Oh, it is only a $1 increase now and everybody will cop it sweet.' I will you what: they won't. They will not cop it sweet at the end of the day because what you have opened up here, by making a two for one tax, is an opportunity for governments of the future, either your government or any future government, to increase these taxes on tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that the minister for tourism and the Australian Tourism Commission, as recently as two weeks ago, convened a very important seminar here in Canberra to talk about the fact that the Japanese tourists coming to Australia, proportionally, are starting to dwindle and we have to do something about that. The major impact where that is going to be felt is in North Queensland and yet here we are lining up and saying, `We are
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2153"> going to hit you for an increase of $1 now and then we are going to hit you for $4 next time around.' How silly is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worse than silly because, again, the Prime Minister stood up in Queensland, in Cairns, before the last election and said: `No increase in existing taxes, no new taxes.' Broken promise No. 1&mdash;that is what these regulations today do. Broken promise No. 2: he said, `We will look after small business and we will look after the tourism industry.' He is not doing any of that. These are anti&hyphen;Queensland, anti&hyphen;jobs regulations. No. 3: our friends up there, the member for Leichhardt and Senator Bill O'Chee&mdash;talk about sending boys on men's errands to go and talk to the tourism industry and try and negotiate a way through this dreadful problem that they had created for themselves&mdash;got up there and said to the tourism operators, `Have I got a deal for you! Come on down. I am going to give you a two for one tax. We will increase it $1 now and next time we will give you a $4 increase. Aren't you lucky!' And they all rolled over. How stupid are the tourism operators as well&mdash;they cannot be left out of this&mdash;to roll over for such a stupid opportunity, to roll over for such a stupid tax to be increased?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is obviously disappointed at the sheer hypocrisy displayed by the opposition&mdash;it is part of the new Labor approach&mdash;and the cynicism that has just been displayed by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) in leading the debate for the opposition to oppose the regulations that will put in place an environmental management charge. I want to relate to the House some of the history but, before doing that, can I put into context exactly what is being proposed here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is being proposed is a management charge to assist the maintenance and running of the GBRMPA, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and also to ensure that the many visitors to the park, both foreign and Australian, are able to enjoy the park in perpetuity with all the facilities. One of the things that has to be decided is who is going to pay. Let us have a look at what a couple of former environment ministers from the Labor Party said. The question basically is who should pay and how should payments should be levied. Senator Faulkner said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 19 May 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`I can't shy a way from the need to have a look at a user pays approach. The pressures from the number of tourists going to those world heritage areas is going to be enormous and we have a responsibility to protect their values.' Senator Faulkner acknowledged there were mixed feelings among environmentalists about the user pays concept, but he acknowledged the need that something would have to be done.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A former minister for the environment, Barry Cohen, a man well respected in this House, was minister from 1983 to 1987. He said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> , in his regular column on 11 September 1996, when discussing the outrage fanned by the opposition about the introduction of the proposal of the charge in the budget, that `most of it, unfortunately, is nonsense'.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He said `most of it, unfortunately, is nonsense'. That is your own side. What he was saying was that the argument that you were putting was nonsense. He pointed out that the cost of running GBRMPA was somewhere in the vicinity of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2154"> $25 million to $26 million and that that of course had to be met. We inherited a black hole&mdash;no doubt about that&mdash;and some decisions had to be made to fix up the difficulties that we inherited from you after some 13 years. The other point made by Barry Cohen in his article was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The official number of visitors to the reef last year</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was about 1.5 million. Of those, 550,000 were from overseas&mdash;one third from Japan and most of the rest were from interstate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What this environmental management charge is about&mdash;and I stress it is an environmental management charge&mdash;is protecting the reef. The concluding comment is the genus of what this is about. Let me quote Cohen again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Great Barrier Reef is Australia's greatest environmental treasure. The burden for protecting it is borne by all Australian taxpayers. Gradually, a larger part of that burden must be shifted to those who most enjoy it&mdash;those who visit the reef.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what this is all about. These regulations provide the opportunity for the visitors to that park to contribute to its ongoing maintenance. The member for Cunningham himself knows a little bit about this. He was involved in that report by the departments. It says here that both yourself and the&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Your signature is on the final report. Let me quote the report, because what it says is quite important. It goes to the central issue, yet again:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A convincing argument can be made for charging those who benefit most from world heritage areas, either financially or as visitors. It is argued that while Australian taxpayers as a whole contribute through government funding to world heritage management, those who reap special rewards from the areas by earning a living from tourism or through their experiences while visiting the areas
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should make an additional financial contribution. The committee considers that where it is feasible to collect fees, they should be more than a token amount. It supports the move in the 1996-97 budget to increase the environmental management fee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is something that the current environment spokesman for the Labor Party has subscribed to, so we find it a little bit cynical, a little bit hypocritical, when you put the argument into the full context, to hear what you have had to say today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EMC, the environmental management charge, was introduced in 1993 by the former government as part of the cost recovery process. It is a charge on tourist operators for the commercial use of the Barrier Reef Marine Park and is generally calculated on a per head per day basis that best reflects the level usage by the operator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed $4 tourist charge, which is part of the regulations, will be levied directly on tourists. Revenue from the EMC contributes, as I have said, to the management and to research functions. The level of EMC compares very favourably with fees charged for use of other areas of high natural value, such as Kakadu, Uluru and many state run national parks. Kakadu and Uluru, for example, charge $15 per person entry fee and the New South Wales government charges $12 per day per car for entry into Kosciusko National Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tourism is the largest and fastest growing commercial use of the marine park. GBRMPA has advised that direct and indirect expenditure on tourism is estimated to exceed $1 billion annually. So to impose a charge on those who are visiting, in a fair and equitable manner, as we have proposed in the regulations, is in line with the sentiments expressed by your own senior senator, Senator Faulkner, and also a former minister, and also has been endorsed by your current environment spokesman, Dr Lawrence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we initially introduced the EMC, it was set at an unrealistically low level of $1 per head to facilitate its introduction. After collection costs are deducted, the charge currently achieves net revenue of about $1.2 million, compared to total GBRMPA budget appropriation of $14.75 million in an industry
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2155"> of about $1 billion. The reef is one of Australia's greatest environmental assets and it is widely recognised as such around the world. It is the base upon which the Queensland and much of Australia's international tourism industry is built. An active management, not a passive management, is going to be required to ensure that the reef environment is protected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because it is recognised as a national asset. You are the only other Queenslander on the other side in this place; you ought to be able to see the value of what is being proposed here and recognise the national significance of the reef, its importance to the tourism industry and therefore the need to be responsible about how we deal with this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we proposed the environmental management charge in the budget&mdash;we moved from $1 to $6&mdash;there was considerable discussion which involved many of my colleagues. The member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), who will be speaking in this debate, was one of those who discussed with the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) about how the charge might best be introduced. It will be moved to a $4 visitor charge from 1 January 1998. It will be operator paid and will be levied at a rate of $2 per visitor. It will be to protect the reef; it will be cost recovery in accord with the requirements and the need to ensure that this important natural asset is going to be managed in a proper way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the recognition of the need to do so under a realistic proposal was put in place in the budget. The industry has raised a number of concerns with the proposal, in particular they claimed: the increase was somewhat unfair on families who would face a compounding charge&mdash;for example, a family of four would face a charge of $24 per day, which is a substantial cost impost on a family
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> holiday; the increase will be felt more keenly by small operators; the daily charge would have a significant impact on the cost structure of bare boat charter hire; there was a potential for a tourist to pay more than $6 per day if they undertake a number of activities in the one day; and the last proportion of the tourism industry is subject to fixed price contracts and pre&hyphen;sold tickets, and these are fixed up to 18 months in advance, which would limit the industry's ability to pass the increase on without severely impacting on profitability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following consideration of all of these claims, a number of modifications were made to reduce any impact of the proposal on the industry. We have demonstrated that, where there are concerns in trying to address the fundamental principle, we are quite prepared to consult with the industry, with the residents and with the local members to come up with a regime that is fair and equitable but gives effect to that fundamental point that I made at the beginning: we must do something in the national interest to ensure that the management of the Great Barrier Reef is done in an active way and that those who benefit most from it are asked to make the highest contribution. That is only fair. This government is about fairness. We have a commitment to fairness and ensuring that those who are going to be subject to decisions that we make are treated in a fair way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EMC was increased from $1 to $2 per head with effect from 1 January 1997. This has been accepted by the major tourism industry associations as a reasonable charge on operators, particularly as the previous amount of $1 had not been adjusted for CPI movements over several years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You committed yourselves to the principle of user pays, but you left the fee at a level that was totally and completely unrealistic. Did it do you any good? It did not. The people know that governments have to make decisions for the fairness of all and in the national interest. What has happened for North Queensland? The coalition won and it has made tough decisions in this area which are often hard to sell, but these decisions have been accepted and are seen to be fair.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2156">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is certainly fair. It has been done in the context of wide consultation with the industry. Two cabinet ministers have been involved&mdash;Senator Hill and Minister Moore. Minister Moore is from Queensland and understands as much as anybody the needs of and developments in tourism. He is a very good minister. He is very experienced&mdash;one of the most experienced parliamentarians in this nation. He has prosecuted the case for tourism, the need for tourism and the growth for tourism. We know that it has to be done in the most responsible way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our natural asset the Great Barrier Reef is protected by the activities of this environmental management charge. Those opposite describe it as a tax. You know and I know and everybody in this chamber knows that this motion of yours is based on cynicism. It is hypocritical. What you are trying to do is walk away from the sensible development of public policy we have seen for our national parks and our world heritage areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You go to another country and try to walk into a world heritage area for nothing&mdash;it just does not happen. It is not real life. This proposal has been through extensive consultation. It marries together the two principles that we think are most important: protecting this national treasure, this natural asset, of world heritage significance and making sure that those who benefit most from participation in the wonders of visiting the reef will contribute towards it in a fair way. This proposal has been spread over a period of extensive consultation with the industry, with local residents and with local members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Local members had a very significant input into the development of how this environmental management charge would be put in place. They deserve to be congratulated because they know that if government is doing its job it has to be fair and has to govern on behalf of the whole nation and not just for sectional interests. That was the point Barry Cohen made back in September in an article&mdash;a fair and decent article. I quote it again because I think it is a good point to finish on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Great Barrier Reef is Australia's greatest environmental treasure. The burden for protecting
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it is borne by all Australian taxpayers. Gradually, a larger part of that burden must be shifted to those who most enjoy it&mdash;those who visit the reef.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How true. How appropriate. Yet there you are trying to walk away from that fundamental principle. We have done it in a fair way. We have done it with consultation. We reject the motion by the member for Cunningham. </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposal that the government has initiated to increase this reef tax is quite simply a broken promise. It is without doubt bad policy and it is a threat to jobs. If the members from North Queensland&mdash;the gang of five&mdash;had any integrity in this matter, they would be pursuing that issue if not the others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than anything, it is a betrayal of Queenslanders. Queensland people in those areas&mdash;in fact, pretty well throughout the state&mdash;voted for this government in numbers unprecedented. The Liberal and National parties have never before enjoyed the support from Queensland that they got at the election last year. In return for that support, they have had broken promises and an attack upon the state's most significant employer and significant export industry&mdash;tourism. That is what the Howard government has done to repay the enormous support for the Liberal and National parties at the election last year. They have broken a fundamental promise and have attacked one of the state's most significant industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me first, though, go to some of the points raised by the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith). He was fond of quoting from the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on this matter, and I have no doubt, from the advice that the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) was given by the Chief Government Whip, that he will be doing much the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before they get too carried away with it, and I notice the member for Leichhardt was a member of that committee as well, the member for Leichhardt might like to be reminded of the comments that his committee report included&mdash;with the committee having a majority of government members. Whilst it
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2157"> went along with the tax hike, it said that it was concerned by the fact that three of the well&hyphen;recognised principles of setting fees had been disregarded. These are principles that the government had said it would honour, these are principles that the industry said were appropriate but, because they have to toe the party line over there, they say, `Yes, we'll agree with the increase but, by the way, we've got a few problems, and one of the problems is it just doesn't meet any of the criteria.' The report went on and said that, for example, only six months lead time had been given, and that this situation had now changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Entsch interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The simple fact is the member for Leichhardt faced a rebellion in his backyard, and he should be the last person to stand here in this place and talk because, of all the people who have had duplicitous approaches to this issue, it is the member for Leichhardt. He has been a hero in his own town. When he gets back up to Cairns, he is the saviour of the tourism industry because he is going to fight this tax, he will fix it for the operators. That is what he says when he is in Cairns, but the people in Cairns need to know&mdash;and I can assure the member for Leichhardt they will be told&mdash;that when he comes down into this place he votes for the tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he has an opportunity to actually do something to give effect to his tough words, he lies doggo, he turns belly up, he is gone. Where is he to be found? He is not on the battlefield. He cowers up there behind the other members of the government and votes with the government every time this issue has been before the parliament. The member for Leichhardt will have an opportunity to correct that record today. He will have an opportunity, as will the other members of the gang of five, to actually do here in the parliament what they said back home they support. I doubt very much they will. They will all toe the line. As cockies corner over here has toed the line on the tariff debate, they will toe the line on this as well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It became clear in that report that there were serious misgivings. The report went on and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the funds raised will be used to partially reduce the level of Commonwealth funding to GBRMPA rather than to enhance visitor services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That says that this money is not going to help the Great Barrier Reef. In spite of the fact that more money is being collected from people going to the reef, GBRMPA gets less money to protect the reef. There is a bit of an inconsistency there, which the minister sort of glossed over in his comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If in fact this money was intended to protect the reef, why has the funding made available for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority been reduced? Why is there a three per cent cut in that? Why is there a three per cent cut when your rationale for increasing this charge is to do the opposite&mdash;to help the reef? This is simply a case of the rhetoric of government members not matching the facts of where the money goes. The report went on and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee views the way in which the increased charge is being introduced and implemented as unfair to tourist operators and it is likely to undermine the joint approach to these things.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If that was the view they held then, nothing has changed since to correct that problem. While referring to the comments of the minister, I should also remind him&mdash;as he was fond of quoting a former member of parliament on our side, Barry Cohen&mdash;that he might like to take the advice of Bruce Baird, who, of course, was a minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sorry, the New South Wales Liberal government, thank you. Bruce Baird has been scathing in his criticism not just of the tax but of the way you have handled this. There has not been consultation with the industry, and the industry has said that many
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2158"> times and so has Bruce Baird. It is not just Bruce Baird who has said that; the Queensland government are not too fussed with you. You could not get someone more right wing in this country than the Queensland government and they are pretty unhappy about the way in which you have handled all of this. The Queensland government in fact has decided not to go ahead with a charge that they were proposing in the marine park because of your government's insistence on pursuing this reef tax. I will quote from a Townsville <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>  of November last year. In talking about the reef tax, it said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Meanwhile, the Queensland Government has decided to exempt popular tourist islands from its plan to introduce entry fees to the State's national parks, costing the Government more than $1 million in lost revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Environment Minister Brian Littleproud&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the National Party minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">said Cabinet had decided yesterday to exempt the islands, primarily those in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, because of the Federal Government's refusal to back down on its 500 per cent increase in the reef visitor tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would have hit tour operators and others with unbudgeted taxes from two directions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Unbudgeted taxes from two directions! You are persisting with your tax on them. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Littleproud said the exemptions to the new ParkPass scheme would include about 50 islands . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He actually went on and said he would be calling on the federal government to fund the shortfall. I wonder whether you got that letter, Minister, from the Queensland Minister for the Environment saying, `Pay up. Because of your stupidity, we in the state of Queensland have had to forgo $1 million in tax revenue, so we want recompense.' I wonder if you remember getting that letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister referred to the history of this, and it is important to acknowledge that this tax was introduced in 1993 by the former Labor government. It was introduced as a charge of $1 with a provision and an undertaking that it would not be increased beyond the CPI. The amazing thing in this debate is that in the past I have heard members of the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government attack us because we were the ones who introduced it.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SMITH" NAMEID="GJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr Warwick Smith</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not beyond CPI, was it?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. We have been attacked because we introduced it, but a few moments ago the minister was attacking us not because we introduced it but because we did not increase it enough. He was attacking us a moment ago because we did not increase the $1 by CPI.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, you have got the member for Leichhardt, who, no doubt, has run around North Queensland&mdash;he may well try to introduce this into the debate today&mdash;saying that we are guilty because we introduced a $1 charge in 1993. On the other hand, his minister attacks us not because we introduced it but because we did not make it high enough; we didn't increase it. They have attended to that problem in one fell swoop. Don't worry about the CPI increase. With this mob the CPI increase is not an issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party government has decided, with the National Party in tow, that they are going to double the $1 to $2 and throw in another $4 just for good measure. They think that by turning a $6 fee into one of $2 and another of $4, the people will say, `That's a good deal. We are a lot better off now because instead of having to pay $6 we only pay $2 here and $4 there.' That is some deal. As the shadow minister said, `Have we got a deal for you. Come on down: $2 today and $4 tomorrow, and you are better off out of it.' That is a lot better than paying $6, Minister!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that when we introduced the charge it was only $1. We did not increase it. What is more, every cent of that dollar went to GRBRMPA. Every cent of that dollar went to the protection of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. What have you done? Instead of giving the money to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, you have increased the charge from $1 to $6 and you have cut the money that you are giving to the protection of the Barrier Reef. What sort of hypocrisy is that? It does not matter what else you say in this debate; that is the fundamental issue that you are misleading the people of Australia on.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is somewhat ironic that when we introduced this charge in 1993 not only were we attacked for introducing it but the member for Braddon claimed at the time that this was the thin end of the wedge. He said that this $1 was going to grow.</PARA>

You can probably forget the tourism part of that portfolio, and I have got to say that he has not had too many wins in industry policy either, come to think of it. The member for Ryan, who is the most senior member for Queensland, presides over the tourism portfolio while all this happens.

Those of us that have had the privilege to visit it can say from experience that it is truly a beautiful area that deserves to be preserved and made available for all to see. It is also a major source of revenue to the tourism industry throughout North Queensland. It is not just Roylan's Cruises or the Quicksilver tours or those other craft that go out to the reef that would be affected. The entire provincial coastline, virtually from Bundaberg north, would be seriously affected if tourism to the Great Barrier Reef were to be reduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a simple fact that tourism to that area is under some threat. The Japanese tourists that have provided the bulk of visitors to that area are not coming in the numbers that they once came in. I was up in North Queensland towards the end of last year talking to some of the operators. They were lamenting the fact that in Japan there was a long weekend and typically the Japanese people have their four&hyphen;day holiday and head out of town; but whereas in previous years literally thousands of Japanese came to North Queensland, last year they did not turn up. The understanding that the North Queensland tourism industry had was that at that time they had been outpriced by Hawaii. The people left Japan, went to Hawaii for their long weekend and then went back home, rather than coming to North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that that was before you lot increased the costs. What you have done is increase the charge. Of course, for some operators&mdash;or most operators&mdash;who pre&hyphen;sell 12 months, 18 months, or two years in advance, what you do is take that money not from the tourists but from the operators. You are directly attacking the viability of those operators. It is simply untenable that that could happen. But for it to happen when a Queensland member of parliament was the minister in charge is disgraceful. It has not passed the ire of the press from Queensland.

It was always believed by the previous government that only their bureaucrats and the government had a knowledge of conservation and that those people who were sustainably using it had no way at all of being able to contribute from a management perspective.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other things that was brought in here which is important to acknowledge is that we did lock in on a one day maximum charge for multiple activities so that, if the operator is operating more than one glass&hyphen;

As we have acknowledged, the member for Cunningham played a very active role in it, as did the shadow minister for the environment. I am also on that committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not unreasonable to expect that tourists, and a large number of those come from overseas, pay a fee. These are people that expect to pay it overseas. It is not that they suddenly come to Australia and find that this is a whole new thing&mdash;suddenly paying for the use or access to world heritage areas. It is practised world wide. At Uluru and at Kakadu there is a $15 charge per person to get into that. Nobody complains about that. They expect to pay it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just reiterate the point that I was there when we negotiated the fee, and the tourist operators wanted it to go into facilities on the reef. That is where it was meant to go. You failed in that. You failed in identifying the charge. As a result of your $8 billion black hole, we have had to find money right across the broad spectrum of all industries in Australia and, unfortunately, tourism has to take its share of it. The tourist operators recognise that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I held these two public meetings. The things that the tourist operators were concerned about were not identifiable transparent charges that could be seen improving access and facilitation to the reef. They did not object to that at all. They objected to the bureaucracy of GBRMPA. I got a litany of problems. I can remember one. On one particular island, GBRMPA wanted this particular operator&mdash;under very heavy
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2164"> threat&mdash;to remove some lantana. It was dreadful and shocking that this lantana should be on the resort's enclave on this island. Some time later, lantana was found on the part administered by GBRMPA. But it was not a worry then. In fact, one person was foolish enough to ask, `Will the leaves fall down and help provide mulch?' That is the sort of nonsense that went on. Tourist operator after tourist operator got up at those meetings and told me that they wanted us to make GBRMPA more accountable. They did not object to some reasonable increase in the charge as long as it was transparent, as long as it went back to the reef and as long as we did not have unfair multiple charging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague and I went and saw the minister. No-one likes introducing a new management charge to any business anywhere, but we had to do it in the circumstances. One of the things we were able to obtain from the government was an inquiry into GBRMPA, which you failed to do in your term of office as GBRMPA's bureaucracy burgeoned. Let me make one covenant: I do not criticise GBRMPA for its pure science. I know the value of its pure science. But I have found from tourist operators that the way the ticketing was done and the way that the permits were issued between GBRMPA and the Queensland state government were a massive bureaucratic nightmare for the operators. They are the things that we have asked to be addressed by way of this inquiry into GBRMPA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other things we obtained from the government were a more simple method of collection&mdash;which will be implemented&mdash;and a consultative process with the industry to give tourist operators representation in the councils of the tourist industry, something the member for Cunningham's party did not do. You did not give the tourist industry a proper consultative process. I have found that my tourist operators, while they would prefer these charges did not go on, are not particularly concerned in the way that the member for Cunningham has said. He has threatened to come up and tell my tourist operators what a dreadful chap I am. Please do.</PARA>

How can you get up in this parliament and say, `We the Labor Party are concerned for the Queensland industry'? For six years, your state colleagues sat there in office and pegged the grants to those very same tourist authorities you were referring to between Bundaberg and Cairns. For six consecutive years, your state colleagues did not increase the funding to the tourist authorities by one cent. You bureaucratised the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation, and now you come into the parliament and cry crocodile tears about the fall in Japanese trade.

The whole spectrum of tourism in Queensland was kicked off by a National Party government. It founded the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation, which became the most effective marketing organisation in Australia. I note that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) was once the deputy general manager of that corporation and did a magnificent job, I might add. It set such a sizzling pace for tourism in Australia that do you know what happened? Even the Australian Tourist Commission had to lift its act. That is what happened.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I take this opportunity to welcome the government's position with respect to amendments 1, 2 and 4. These amendments flow from a welcome and constructive relationship that has developed notwithstanding significant differences that still exist between the opposition and the government. When these matters were first brought before this parliament, I expressed the opposition's view that a number of the measures were harsh and unjustifiable, but I made it plain in discussions with the minister at the time that, where we could reach common ground, the opposition was seeking, in so far as it was possible, to enable that to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition was very concerned that a gulf had opened up within the public sphere of debate on immigration matters in an environment that had been made too heated by the remarks of the Independent member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and the circumstances whereby those remarks were not immediately repudiated by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). At a later stage this parliament itself had to express an agreed position which was ultimately unanimously adopted&mdash;in the absence of one or two members&mdash;and which put us all on the record as condemning absolutely any discriminatory policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That did not leave the situation as one in which there were not significant differences between the government and the opposition in relation to specific program proposals which were being advanced by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). It was the opposition's view that the gulf between the two parties was unhealthy in the way in which the community ought to proceed on these matters. It is true that there has in the past been a recognition both on the part of the opposition and the governing parties that it is healthier for the community if common ground can be found for these issues&mdash;whilst there can never be absolute bipartisanship&mdash;and divisiveness not allowed to foster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were further discussions between the minister and me and in those discussions I indicated to the minister that we could perhaps seek some common ground on some of the issues which had hitherto divided us. A number of these matters were taken up by the minister, for which I thank him. As a result, the minister undertook not to proceed with the English education charges, at least for the current budgetary period. I do not know what the minister's intention is with respect to the next budget round. That is a matter between him, the Department of Finance and his colleagues. We held the  view strongly that it was wrong in principle to increase the English language education charges. In opposition the government itself had said that English was the glue that held our community together, and it seemed to us hypocritical and inconsistent that the government in its first budget
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2170"> was proposing to increase charges for people newly arrived in this country so that the cost to them of acquiring those necessary skills would be increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recognition of this, the minister has accepted the deletion of the increased English education charges in the proposal for a single visa charge. So the minister gets his way, in administrative simplicity, for the way in which the visa scheme operates but the parliament, in a sense, expresses the correct precedence that it gives to the importance of English language. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The parliament through this mechanism gives proper priority to the importance of ensuring that those who do arrive in our country are able to access English language services and at a cost which is not excessive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area which was recognised by the minister as one which could be modified was in relation to de facto and interdependency applications. The opposition has never taken the view that it is inappropriate for the government to insist on verification of the substance of de facto and interdependent claims for relationships before people come to this country. There has been some suggestion that we were intending to be so irresponsible, but that was certainly never the case when we were in government, and in opposition we indicated in our comments on this bill that we stood ready to  assist the minister with all reasonable measures to make certain that any looseness in the system could be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We supported the minister on a number of matters, including the establishment of a two&hyphen;year probationary onshore arrangement so that when couples, whether they be married or de facto or interdependent, arrived in this country the legitimacy of the ongoing relationship could be monitored and, if for some reason it was found during that period of time the relationship had not been sustained, the person who had been given the visa would then not be able to be treated as a permanent resident on that basis any more. That seemed to be a fair approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did, however, have genuine concerns about the application of a scheme that would have required a two&hyphen;year prior cohabitation
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arrangement outside of Australia for people to establish the alleged legitimacy of a de facto or interdependent relationship. We noted, for example, that this seemed in practice to rule out the efficacy of what was a beneficial arrangement that this government and the previous government had recognised as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister was not saying that he would discontinue the interdependent and de facto relationships, but the practical import of saying that you needed a continuous period of two years living together before you could access that claim would have made it very difficult. Many people who have travelled overseas and established relationships and regard them as akin to a marriage&hyphen;like relationship and regard themselves as having given the same kinds of commitments would have found it impossible to access that scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, one of the things that would have flowed from that, I believe, would have been an increase in the so-called sham marriages. In other words, people who had otherwise legitimately put themselves forward as couples, who had established a permanent and ongoing loving relationship which they intended to continue for the rest of their lives and, on that basis, who had come into Australia as partners would have been compelled to have gone through with a marriage ceremony which they really did not desire. There are of course some people who, for various reasons, choose to have relationships not consummated formally by marriage. That would have had an impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, it would have also created a situation where that avenue of rectifying what would have been basically a bar to the efficacy of the de facto arrangement was not available to interdependent couples. The interdependency class is predominantly utilised by people who form same sex relationships. It certainly does not require that as a matter of law but predominantly it is so used, and of course such persons are not in a position to formalise their relationship by a marriage&hyphen;like ceremony. So it would have opened up an area of discrimination in public policy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> In those
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2171"> provisions, the minister has undertaken that, in exercising his powers to create regulations under these provisions, the period will be set at no greater than 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst this itself may create some particular instances of hardship, the minister has also recognised that, by providing that, there be a discretion residing in himself which can be called upon in circumstances where that is necessary. Such circumstances may arise, for example, in instances where the legal regimes of overseas jurisdictions are such as to bring upon people having de facto or same sex relationships social or penal consequences of an adverse kind. The minister is aware of these matters and I am certain that we can regard him as being appropriately aware of those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a good solution here in the sense that the informal arrangements that used to exist&mdash;the benchmark for a period of prior cohabitation&mdash;are now, as a matter of policy, going to be set by regulation. That clarifies the matter and people will understand precisely where they stand. It allows the minister the capacity to respond to those particular instances where some particular hardship does emerge and allows him the power to deal with those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has also picked up a number of concerns in relation to the comments made by the opposition regarding the power to remove from Australia people who have made false representations on their applications to come here. This was not an area where there was any policy difference between the government and the opposition but a concern that we did not open up a situation where statelessness might be an issue. In the second reading speech in the Senate, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Vanstone, dealt with those matters in a way which we regarded as acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might just mention briefly, too, that allowing a one-year residency period overseas before de facto and interdependent relationships are accepted in the normal course distinguishes those relationships from married applicants. Because the law will now recog
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nise that difference, there is a technical amendment which goes to ensuring that this is not inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most members of the Senate who spoke on this matter, and indeed I suspect most members of this House, would prefer that not to have to be the case as a matter of principle. Nonetheless, it is required. To achieve the social policy objective of getting clarity in this area, the opposition has reluctantly accepted that that is a price that must necessarily be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now, finally, to the issue of the capping arrangements that the minister has referred to. Perhaps if I allowed the minister to respond to those points and then deal with that issue separately, that would be convenient. The minister is anticipating some further steps in relation to those matters and perhaps we might speak briefly on those before the debate concludes.</PARA></SPEECH>

I do welcome the cooperation that has been extended to try to find areas of common ground. It has meant, of course, that the government has been able to achieve greater cost recovery, which was an election commitment. It has ensured that we are able to deal with the citizenship deprivation issue&mdash;a situation which, before, has allowed people to come here deceiving us as to their status when they migrate and to cure that by taking out Australian citizenship a fairly short time after their residency. That is not a matter that should be allowed to go on. And of course there is the cohabitation issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is regrettable in the context of the welcome coincidence of view that we have
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2172"> reached on these matters that the honourable member saw fit to take a whack at the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He is always keen to do this. The Prime Minister has always taken the view that he should assert positively the government's position on issues of race and discrimination and has done so at every opportunity and continues to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting aspect of the Prime Minister's approach is that when we undertook very extensive consultation on the government's development of the proposals to implement the race education campaign two issues came out very strongly from all the people who we were talking to. The first was: should it be called an anti-racism campaign? The people we were talking to said, `No, that is too negative. We do not think it is appropriate.' Second, they said, `Whatever messages you are going to give, they need to be positive. You will not change people's attitudes by berating them, but you can change people's attitudes by bringing them along with you in a better understanding of our cultural diversity and what it means for Australia.' That was a very strong message to us. Interestingly, it was the approach that the Prime Minister took on this very question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that we have often talked about getting a bipartisan approach on these matters. I have been on the other side of the House and have had to deliver on bipartisanship. I have to say that when I was in opposition I found that former prime ministers and ministers would hand down from on high the government's position and then berate us if there was not agreement with the position that the government had taken because we were in some way depriving the government of bipartisan support which had long been a feature of this policy area.</PARA>

You may want to use some of the words that I used to describe the position we would reach. When we were able to agree, I used to describe it as a `coincidence of view'. I hope we are able to achieve more coincidence of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does have its policy commitments and we will be looking at the issues as ones that ought to be pursued. As to the cost recovery issue, we have certainly said that we will not proceed with the English education charge. The Senate has taken a view on that matter. I do not think it is yet ready to reconsider that approach, but I hope it will in the future. We have withdrawn that matter so as to be able to proceed with it on another day. I expect to come back with proposals to enable the Senate to relook at this question. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> I hope that the Senate would look at the question, which I have posed before in this House, of the extent to which we can reasonably expect the Australian taxpayers&mdash;in other words, other Australians&mdash;to pay for the English language education of the family members of those who access Australia through, say, the business migration program as, say, investors bringing millions of dollars into Australia and the view that, if you come with a spouse or children who do not have English, there should be a subsidy for the cost of teaching those family members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the view that if you come through the skilled categories&mdash;that is, if you are in the categories where people are expected to have resources and skills that are going to enable them to earn an income in Australia and resources to maintain themselves&mdash;it is not unreasonable to ask that you meet the full cost of the education in English of your spouse and dependants. I do not think that is a matter it is unreasonable to press. I hope that on that matter the opposition may see the light. I hope that we may be able to come to some accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of the de facto and interdependent categories, the interdependents are not dealt with in this bill. I can regulate in that area, obviously subject to the approval of the Senate and this House, in the same way that I am seeking power to regulate in relation to de facto relationships. I have always seen the de facto and interdependent categories as like in this context, and when I propose regulations as a result of the passage of these amendments I will propose like amendments for the interdependent class.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2173">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted that John Laws wrote of my compromising in this area that I was in some way a wimp. It ought to be clear that we are putting in place very significant provisions to enable us to deal with bona fides questions. The reason that we are of the view that there should be a reasonable cohabitation period for de factos before arrival in Australia is in order to be able to substantiate that the relationship is one of an enduring character, not one that has been conveniently cobbled together for the purposes of migration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our policy argued that it should be two years, the parliamentary committee had argued before that it should be at least one and the former government thought that it should be six months but because of the Sex Discrimination Act was told that the relevant provisions had to be removed. That effectively meant that de factos could theoretically have a relationship of a week. Sure, somebody had to make a judgment as to whether it was bona fide, and it may be a difficult test to satisfy in those circumstances, but that was the position my officers were put in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeking here a provision for a cohabitation period, which we think is reasonable. The 12 months as a compromise is a position that we are to agree on. But let me make the point as to why I think it is appropriate in this area to have that distinction. Marriage does bring with it some consequences. One consequence is that you can only separate through a process of divorce. That may be relatively easy in Australia under our Family Law Act.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996, which has been circulated, is consequential upon the acceptance by the House of the amendments made by the Senate. Earlier this week the Senate rejected amendments to the Migration Act designed to enable this and future governments to deliver a balanced and orderly migration program. This rejection of the full range of enhancements to the capping provisions of the Migration Act is very disappointing to me. As I have said before, delivery of a balanced and orderly migration program is, in the government's view, the only way of restoring community confidence in the way in which the program itself is conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is on track to deliver its migration program of 74,000 this financial year. However, this was not helped by the disallowance by the Senate of some of the key measures last year, and I have elaborated before on the impact of those decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to aged parent applications, after the majority of family test was rejected, we saw a 126 per cent increase in applications in the month immediately following. Similarly, we saw the rate of applications in the spouse category change. They had been trending downwards significantly month by month and when the rejection occurred the trend was upwards&mdash;not in the same order but it was still a trend upwards.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2174">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be able to deliver the program this year, however, without the need to cap. The reductions that we had achieved early in the stage were sufficient, but with the time lags in processing applications we do believe that we will be able to deliver the program without the need to cap and terminate applications in the aged parent, spouse and dependant categories. However, the very significant increase in aged parent applications following disallowance, as I mentioned before, could well mean that next year capping will be required in relation to aged parent applications. The majority of family test would have distinguished those applications from those in the balance of family test quite considerably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have given some directions in relation to processing. Certainly we are processing applications in accordance with the law, but we will give priority to those who satisfy the majority of family test rather than the balance of family test. If it becomes necessary to queue, obviously those that will be postponed will be those where the lesser test is satisfied. But, obviously, with the growth that has occurred in the aged parent category applications, there is an expectation that next year we will need to cap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the spouse category, there is also that possibility, but decisions as to the direction and size of next year's program will be taken by the government in the next couple of months, and I am presently engaged in extensive community consultations as a lead-up to that decision. In that context, I would not like to predict at this stage what may be required in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In discussions with the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), as he has alluded to, and in Senator Bolkus's statement in the Senate to this bill, the opposition has indicated that it is prepared to support the cap and queue powers in relation to aged parents, but not in relation to spouses or dependent children. As a result, the government has reluctantly accepted the Senate's amendment to this Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). However, we are now moving what I am told are consequential amendments which will extend the cap and queue powers to aged parents. The capacity to cap and queue aged parents will
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reduce pressure on other parts of the program and make it less likely that the government will have to consider using the cap and terminate powers in migration classes where that is the only available mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of this bill, the government does not intend to continue to pursue the other amendments to capping powers. However, we believe that the ability to cap and queue all parts of the program is a necessary and appropriate power for the government to have. We will continue to press this point and see whether we can get further agreement in relation to those matters from our colleagues both here and in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments I have moved today are straightforward. The first item in schedule 1A is a technical amendment to section 5(1) of the act omitting `aged parent' from the list of definitions. This is consequential to the other two items, which remove all references to `aged parent' in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second item in the schedule omits reference to `aged parent' in section 84(3) of the act. The amendment has the effect of removing aged parents from an exemption from determinations suspending processing of visa applications of a specified class.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third item in the schedule omits reference to `aged parent' in section 87(1) of the act. The amendment has the effect of removing aged parents from an exemption from determinations placing limits on the number of visas in a specified class that may be granted in a specified financial year. I commend the amendment to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue at stake is the principle that was established in legislation&mdash;it was proposed by the now minister when he was spokesman for the opposition and agreed to by then government&mdash;that is, we would exempt direct family&mdash;husbands and wives, dependent children and aged parents&mdash;from arrangements relating to the power of the government to determine or to cap entry to this country. But even at that time there was a distinction between, on the one hand, husbands and wives and dependent children and, on the other hand, aged parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the act prohibited the minister from capping those categories, inherent in the arrangements was a recognition that people coming to this country did not have an absolute right to bring their aged parents here because of the balance of family test. That balance of family test meant that, where people did not have at least half their family in this country, they could not avail themselves of the right to sponsor their aged parents to come to Australia. So it was never an absolute fundamental right that anybody who was a permanent resident of this country could inherently bring their aged parents here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have sought, in discussions with the minister, to try to disaggregate, to break out, the two parts and to say that we hold it as part of Australia's traditions that no government has a part to play in determining who we should or should not marry or to interfere with that fundamental right of all parents to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have care of their dependent children. We believe that it is unthinkable that the government should seek such a capacity. It is not necessary in the management of the program. In the spirit in which this debate is being conducted, I will not seek to use some of the evidence to debate this issue in detail, but I would simply make the assertion that it is completely within the minister's power to deliver a program of the size of that which he has undertaken to deliver without any recourse to draconian measures which would go to the fundamentals of family formation. I believe that the minister knows this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that there has been some recent one-off pressure in the numbers of people coming here under the marriage visa class. Much of that, of course, flowed from the aftermath of the decision&mdash;right or wrong&mdash;to admit some thousands of Chinese after the Tiananmen Square demonstrations and the recognition that those students who were here could remain. Naturally, some have married Australians in Australia but many have sought to bring their partners out from China and, as they are now permanent residents of this country, the law has facilitated that. That is a one-off situation which may have sustained some increasing pressure. In a sense, that is working its way through the pipeline. I think the minister would accept that some of the pressure that he might have expected to exist no longer exists. As the demographics have worked through, I think the minister is increasingly seeing that some of the fears that he might have harboured when he first took office are less real.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would say that it is a fundamental family right to be able to have one's marriage partner and dependent children in Australia. We note, for example, that in the United States that is an absolute right. In most analogous countries it is an absolute right. A United States citizen has that absolute right; in fact, the spouse is not even counted as part of the immigration program. It is not really an immigration related issue. The minister recognised as much when he was the driving force to put into the legislation those measures which say that it is no part of the government's task to deal with those matters.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2176"> In fact he said that it would be an unconscionable thing to do that. He said that if a government were to do that it would cause agony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, the government will be spared that agony by the minister's welcome concession today that he will accept the compromise proposal that I floated with him some while ago; that is, we would offer to him our support were he to propose a capping mechanism in relation to the aged parents matter. He responded by saying that, whilst this was not what he was seeking, he would recognise that that would significantly reduce the pressure that might otherwise exist in having to deal with other categories of the family program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of politics in this. The first time we discussed these matters it was indeed the intention of the opposition to propose exactly this amendment in the Senate, but the minister, determined to at least try his hand in the Senate to see whether there could be agreement on his proposals, insisted on taking this issue to the wire. Instead of an agreed package being wrapped up in the Senate when the matter was debated there, the matter has now come back to the House and the minister is proposing an amendment to his own legislation. I guess ministers are entitled to try their hands, but I think it is a bit unfortunate that we had a debate on this point that need not have happened. There was an opportunity to get closer to that coincidence of outcomes with less rhetorical impact in the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make a couple of other points about this matter. In the debate in the Senate those representing the minister and speaking on behalf of the government frequently asserted that the minister was seeking a compassionate power to cap and queue applications for husbands and wives and children so he would not have recourse to the cap and kill provisions. I think it is at least significantly doubtful that the minister has any capacity, as he asserts, to cap and kill. If he does have those powers, it would require the most extraordinarily strange reading of an act which, because of the minister's intervention when in opposition, has at least on three occasions clearly expressed prohibitions against steps
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that would allow the government to interfere in that fundamental family formation issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the minister would be heading into a legal minefield and a moral quagmire to do that. If the power does exist it would be akin to Borbidge's threat not to appoint a senator if a casual vacancy arose. In other words, it would certainly not be within the spirit of the legislation and I suggest probably not within the letter of the legislation. We have had this sort of veiled threat before that the minister would prevent Australians from being able to marry a person of their choice or have care of their dependent children and would use crude mechanisms to achieve that were we not to fall into line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not going to fall into line in relation to those kinds of threats. We do not believe this parliament should fall into line in these matters. The minister is on record, in his previous incarnation as opposition spokesman, saying that it would be unconscionable&mdash;I think that was the word&mdash;that such a proposal be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot take the politics out of this entirely. Significant areas of disagreement will remain. But I welcome the fact that the gap in the public policy area of debate has been narrowed somewhat as a result of these matters. I think that is healthy for Australia. I know there are some on my side who feel uncomfortable about the degree to which this middle ground has been achieved, particularly in relation to Sex Discrimination Act changes which are seen as a matter of principle, and some who believe that no ground should have been yielded in relation to the aged parents issue. Nonetheless, this is a matter of seeking to make intelligent public policy contributions to an issue which is always important to Australia's public debate and discussion but more importantly in the context of the present times where debate has been allowed to become so heated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the minister for at least recognising that, from time to time, it is the case that governments dump things onto the parliament and demand adherence and for recognising that it does require a process to work through it to try to get to a position which is going to be acceptable to the community, the parlia
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2177"> ment and all the parties in this House. I put on record my appreciation and thanks for the way in which the minor parties in the Senate have contributed to a sensible resolution of this debate. All on the non-government side in the Senate who have played their part in this debate deserve those warm words of thanks. They all came from different positions, but in the end they said that the government ought to draw back from some of the more extreme measures it was proposing, but did so in a constructive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that we will support the amendment because it was an amendment that we were prepared to move in the Senate. I think that we can say that some commonsense cooperation has occurred. We firmly say that no government should restrict the most fundamental of human rights&mdash;the right to marry and start a family. I think the outcome is one which sustains good public policy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I conclude this discussion on the amendment moved to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) by welcoming the support for the amendment as proposed.

We have had to make choices as to who would or would not be able to bring their parents to Australia. I understand that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the amendment is intended to suggest, however, that capping should not apply in other parts of the program, I do not follow it through to that conclusion. The cap and terminate power is in place, and it was put in place by the former government. The provisions are there. It is regrettable to me that we cannot move to use, if necessary, provisions that would not be as harsh on the people involved but would achieve the same outcomes so far as government policy was concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for that reason I have sought a power which would enable me to cap and queue applicants in the category of spouse and dependent children&mdash;not that I would look wantonly at using that power. I acknowledge that it is a significant step for a government
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to take, but it does depend upon the extent to which you are faced with a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) is always keen to go back to the time when I commented on these matters in 1989. We were dealing with a very different situation in 1989 to the situation we are dealing with today.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="KERR" NAMEID="RH4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You were in opposition.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not a question of government and opposition. It is a question of the size of the program and the size of the relevant cohort of people we are dealing with. In 1989 we had a larger program, but the number of people who applied on the basis of a relationship with an Australian was much smaller. If I remember correctly, I think the figure was around 14,000 to 17,000. It was of that order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a much smaller program of almost 74,000, I would have been faced with spouse, de facto and fiance applications of the order of 33,000 if I had not implemented some of these other measures. So almost half of the total migration program would have been people who were in a relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty we have is that, while we are endeavouring to implement a whole range of measures&mdash;many of which have been supported by the opposition&mdash;to test people's bona fides, we are still concerned as to what impact the additional applications from people seeking to access Australia on that basis is having on the balance in the program itself. It was for that reason that we sought to have a cap and queue power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A cap and queue power is one which enables us essentially not to deny a person entry but to say, `Your entry cannot be guaranteed at a particular time. It will be perhaps next year, but you will still be in the same order in the queue based on when you lodged your application.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A cap and terminate provision would operate quite differently. The cap, when it is reached, means that all existing applications are terminated. The impact of that on the parties involved is that, if they still wish to pursue an application to access Australia, they have to lodge a fresh application. If a minister
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2178"> were not so minded as to waive or refund the fees on the first application, people would be faced with a very considerable cost impost. That could be readily fixed, as I have suggested, by waiving the fees. People would then be in a race to put their application in to secure a good position in the queue. In fact, some people who had applications in the year before&mdash;</PARA>

In the beginning he was telling me that I had no power; now he asserts it is doubtful. Let me assure the honourable member that there is no doubt as to the legality of regulating to establish the appropriate class and the legality of the acts taken while those regulations are in place.

There may well be consequences. Some people may be distinctly unhappy that we have taken such a decision, and I can understand that. But I have been perfectly up&hyphen;front about it. There is nothing veiled about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have simply wanted it to be known that there ought to be some good sense shown and the government should have a range of provisions that would enable it to manage the program. As I said, the government is not about denying entry to people, particularly its citizens. But the government is saying that the question of when people enter is a matter that can be addressed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not apologise for wanting to test the numbers in the Senate either. I am not in a position to know what is in the minds of the Independents or the minor parties in the Senate when they vote on these matters. At times it has been suggested around this place that you can secure support in the Senate. All I can say is that I have not known in any of these matters where support can be secured. I find out on the day matters are presented for a vote where some of those in the Senate actually stand on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting aspect in relation to this measure is that, when it was dealt with in the Senate, the Australian Democrats at first said they opposed it and then said they supported it. Then, when they changed their mind and decided to vote against the measure, they told us it was because there was a misunderstanding and they thought they were party to the deal between the opposition and the government on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The fact is that decisions on these matters seem to change during the debate at times. Honourable senators make it clear that they will announce their decisions on many of these matters when they actually deliver their vote. I must say, on this matter, I did not note from either the honourable member for Denison or his advisers any greater certainty than I have as to what the Senate might be able to do on this question. I think it was appropriate to test the numbers. I will continue to test the numbers. I have made it clear that this is an area in which such a power may be needed in the future. But I do not intend to rail about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, if the Democrats were of a mind to look at these questions again, I would welcome their support and introduce another bill at an appropriate time for this matter to be dealt with if it emerges that that support is forthcoming. I would not want, in the spirit of commenting about these matters, to lose any support from the minor parties or the Independent senators by suggesting that I am any less grateful for the support I do receive on particular occasions. Obviously, when there is that support forthcoming, I am appreciative of it. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2179">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the final point&mdash;one which I hope all the Democrats will keep in mind when they look at the position they have adopted on these questions&mdash;that the Democrats are the party that have said in their policy that they believe we can have a net zero migration. That would mean a program of 28,000 people. They then tell me that we should accommodate all refugees and applicants on humanitarian grounds. That brings the number down to about 16,000. If you take into account the New Zealanders who have an as of right entry&mdash;and I have not heard the Democrats advocating that they should be denied that&mdash;that brings it down pretty close to 2,000.</PARA>

I do not know how you will decide how to allocate 2,000 places in the rest of the program unless you have some very significant powers in relation to cap and queuing and cap and terminating applications. I find it very difficult to understand, as a proposition, how you can advocate on the one hand a net zero migration and, on the other hand, deny the government the powers to achieve a balanced program with 74,000 people. That is what these measures were designed to deliver&mdash;a balanced program with 74,000 people.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZT4">Mr SOMLYAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It is my pleasure today to table the report of the review of Joint Committee of Public Accounts of the Tax law Improvement Bill 1996. The bill is the second tranche of legislation to replace progressively the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The first tranche of legislation has also been reviewed by the JCPA, in report 345, and is currently before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that this bill rewrites existing law does not diminish its importance. There are few pieces of Commonwealth legislation that affect more Australians than tax laws. It should be a matter of considerable concern, therefore, that the most significant of these laws, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, is in danger of collapsing under the weight of its own complexity. This problem is recognised by all, from taxpayers to the tax office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act is in desperate need of a comprehensive overhaul. It is nearly 3,500 pages long, it cannot be easily read or understood, it no longer has a recognisable structure and it has had amendment piled on top of amendment over the last 60 years. The cost to business and individual taxpayers of trying to understand and comply with this law ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion annually. Any reduction in these compliance costs, therefore, will be a significant micro&hyphen;economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defects of the 1936 act have been known for some time. Indeed in 1993, the JCPA report 326&mdash;a report on the administration of tax law and the operations of the ATO&mdash;recommended that tax law be simplified. That task is being undertaken by the tax law improvement project, known by all as
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2180"> TLIP. TLIP is rewriting the old act in five legislative packages. The subject of this report, the Tax Law Improvement Bill, is the second package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Complaints about the faithfulness with which the Tax Law Improvement Bill reflects the old 1936 act focused mainly on two divisions&mdash;division 42 dealing with plant depreciation, and division 70 dealing with trading stock. Accordingly, most of the committee's recommended amendments to the bill refer to clauses within these divisions. For the most part, the bill itself has been well drafted and the complaints have been few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The greatest debate during the inquiry has centred around what has not been included in the bill rather than what has. Time after time, the committee has received evidence from people and organisations frustrated that TLIP's narrow policy mandate has precluded it from simplifying the policy complexities that underlay the 1936 act. As a result, real simplification of the tax law is not being achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In report 326, which provided the genesis for the rewrite project, the JCPA recommended that the 1936 act be rewritten in order to simplify it. The committee believes that the previous and current governments have chosen to interpret `simplification' in the narrow sense. TLIP's role is to restructure, renumber and rewrite in plain language the income tax law. TLIP does not have a mandate to make anything but the most minor policy changes. It is true that TLIP is able to make limited, small policy changes with the approval of the Assistant Treasurer. However, the changes have only been made where they have had no significant revenue impacts and where the changes help to clarify the operation of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The critics are concerned that, by having this very limited mandate, TLIP is perpetuating unclear or unworkable sections of the 1936 act in the Tax Law Improvement Bill. The committee concedes that there is an immediate and pressing need to reduce the complexity of the 1936 act. This reason alone is sufficient justification for the rewrite project.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the committee believes that TLIP needs an expanded mandate to give greater latitude to contemplate `small p' policy issues. The committee has recommended accordingly. Of course, TLIP would still have to refer any broader policy simplification recommendations back to government for final approval, but TLIP could at least consider a greater range of policy simplification issues that are of such concern to the private sector and which currently have been excluded from the rewrite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In report 345, the committee responded to the lack of progress on tax policy reform of any magnitude by recommending that a revenue committee of parliament be established. Such a committee would be concerned with tax policy simplification issues that are beyond TLIP's mandate to consider. Preferably, the JCPA should be given additional resources by the government to undertake such a function. Failing that, the JCPA recommended that a joint standing or joint select committee on revenue be established to undertake the task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA believes that the arguments for a revenue committee of parliament remain equally valid. For this reason, the committee continues to press the government for a response to the recommendation. In fact, the committee believes that a revenue committee could complement TLIP's activities&mdash;if TLIP were given an expanded mandate&mdash;by coordinating and assisting the consideration of `small p' policy issues. The adoption of these two major recommendations&mdash;TLIP with an expanded mandate and the establishment of a revenue committee&mdash;will facilitate the government's pre-election promise to allow greater private sector involvement in tax law simplification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has also made a number of other policy recommendations which are beyond TLIP's current mandate to implement. Some of the recommendations are quite specific; others call for a wider review. All are urgent. They include recommendations for review of the entertainment and non-compulsory uniform provisions in the law. One witness rightly called these provisions `mind numbing in their exactitude' and they
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2181"> should have no place in progressive income tax law. Such reviews will take time, with appropriate consultation to resolve. They should receive urgent attention by government, but their resolution should not delay passage of the Tax Law Improvement Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As I mentioned, the major professional and industry bodies, while supporting the rewrite process in principle, have expressed concern with the way it is being undertaken in practice. The committee was concerned at the strength of the criticism by these organisations of aspects of TLIP's work. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the government allow greater private sector involvement in TLIP's decision making processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> TLIP's senior management team includes two positions for private sector practitioners. The purpose of having these positions is to bring private sector experience and advice within TLIP. The positions play an important role, particularly as the committee notes the perception held in parts of the private sector that TLIP tends to take a pro-revenue stance when interpreting and rewriting ambiguous sections of the 1936 act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Although both positions have been filled in the past, a vacancy has existed for one of the private sector positions since December 1995. The committee is concerned at the delay in filling this position and believes that this needs to be done promptly. A stronger private sector presence in TLIP's senior management will help provide valuable private sector insights and perspectives and also reassure the private sector about TLIP's impartiality. This position would be most appropriately filled by a tax expert with a legal background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The committee believes that, even with both the above positions filled, there will still remain a need for greater private sector involvement in TLIP's senior management. Accordingly, the committee has recommended additional funding be provided to allow TLIP to hire tax specialists on short-term contracts as different parts of the 1936 act are rewritten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been extensive consultation on draft versions of parts of the Tax Law Im
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provement Bill since July 1995. Nonetheless, critics have argued that TLIP has introduced changes into the bill before parliament that were not included in the final exposure draft version. There is argument over the significance of these late changes and whether there should have been more time to debate them. There will always be a balance to strike between allowing as much consultation as possible and ensuring that the legislation is implemented. TLIP will need to strike an appropriate balance for the next tranche of legislation in particular, which rewrites the capital gains tax provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For its own part, the JCPA has not had time to review the bill as comprehensively as it would have liked. The committee will seek greater time to consider future tranches of legislation if they are referred to the committee by the House. Ultimately, the confidence of all parties in the consultative process is vital if support for the project is to be maintained. The government will need to schedule sufficient time for parliamentary debate and review of the next tranche of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the JCPA continues to support TLIP's work, provided that the government supports the committee's recommendations for improvement. Completion of TLIP's rewrite process is the most efficient way of simplifying the 1936 act quickly so that tax law can once again be understood by business and tax professionals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as importantly, the next generation of tax professionals will be able to start their training and careers with a clearer and more usable act. Ultimately, however, tax simplification requires more than just a rewrite or a tidying up of policy complexities. It needs a wide ranging review of tax policy at the federal and state level. Only after such a review can compliance costs truly come down. The committee urges the government to consider this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a final note, the committee would like to thank all those individuals and organisations which have provided written and oral evidence and advice to the JCPA. Some have given evidence to the committee three or four times. We also thank the various officials
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2182"> from TLIP and the committee's consultant, Mr Michael Bannon of Duesburys.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I endorse the comment of my colleague the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) and Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am proud to be Deputy Chair. I start with a quote from a coalition policy statement for the last election:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Coalition has three concerns with how this process has developed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, the process of tax law improvement and the rewrite of the tax act. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, with only minor exceptions, participants in the tax law simplification project have not been allowed to advise on policy. They have been limited to undertaking a rewriting exercise. Second, they have not been consulted on new tax bills before they enter the parliament and whether they conform with the principles of tax simplification. Third, they are under resourced, particularly with respect to the time required for private sector participants to fully participate in the reform process.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That quote from the coalition's policy document is particularly relevant to the report that we brought down today, because it raises some issues which, after 12 months in government, still have not been addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rewrite of the tax act was an initiative commenced by the previous government and one which had broad support across the chamber. Although we occasionally railed each other on the committee about our being against business on this side of the  House and the other side being vehemently for it, the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> truth of the matter is that it is more a situation of disagreeing slightly on the paths but of having in many respects some broad principles of agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those principles of agreement is the question of red tape as it impacts on business. There can probably be no bigger example of red tape that impacts on the operation of business at all levels than the tax act, because it is, as has been said earlier, a huge, extremely complex document and one that needs urgent and extensive review and reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, having said that, there are problems with the TLIP process. I bear no grudge against TLIP themselves&mdash;I think they are doing a good job in difficult circumstances because, as was mentioned by the member for Fairfax, the fact is that they are underresourced. One of the two private sector positions on TLIP, as was mentioned earlier, has not been filled since December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, in a situation where the principal impact of the tax act and any rewrite that occurs is going to relate to the private sector, it is essential and crucial that there is serious private sector involvement in terms of the development and conclusion of any rewrite. We now have a situation where, for just over 12 months now, one of the two positions on the TLIP body has been vacant. In fact, it needs to be filled urgently. The committee has also made a case for the extension of that from two to three positions, and I certainly support that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue relates to the question raised by the member for Fairfax and taken up in the report about the need to address the question of expanding TLIP's mandate. Unfortunately, because of an illness in the family, I was not able to attend the recent committee hearing on this piece of legislation. However, as someone who took part in the earlier consideration of the first tranche of bills that came forward I say that the song remains the same. There is a serious need to consider a range of issues which might appear to the untrained&mdash;and I consider myself to be that in this area&mdash;to be not of major significance, but there are significant issues coming up which would be best determined as `small p' policy issues.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2183">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, it is an issue for government and for this government to address. As their policy statement says, significant changes could be made which would have a real benefit in limiting red tape if those issues were taken up. The report mentions a number of these in recommendations in terms of highlighting what the particular issue is but agrees that TLIP is not in a situation of being able to resolve them. The report basically urges the government to take action on those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going on from that, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Fairfax, there is the question of a revenue committee of parliament. The question of a revenue committee of the parliament to consider these sorts of issues is something which the government has to address. It is one recommendation from an earlier report which the government at this stage has not commented on, but it is an issue of significance. A range of these sorts of matters is coming forward, not only in terms of the rewrite of the tax act but of other legislation. There is a range of issues there which I do not believe this parliament is effectively scrutinising or making recommendations on. It is something which the government must address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the wider question of resources, I mention it with respect to TLIP itself, and also in terms of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts or, if the government decides otherwise, another form of committee which could perform the role of a revenue committee. The fact is that in recent times the public accounts committee has regularly been getting requests to do reports on regulations of this type. On this occasion a totally unrealistic time line was given for reporting. I understand there are some reasons for that with regard to the question of operative dates and the need to get legislation through speedily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is certainly no doubt that the legislation is broadly supported, but the fact of the matter is committees cannot properly consider matters if they do not have the time to do it. Luckily I think this particular change in the legislation has had less controversy attached to it than earlier ones, but certainly I suspect that components which will come through later will require significantly more time for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them to be considered properly, to allow matters of contention, hopefully, to be resolved, and to ensure that better legislation is brought before this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going on from that, I would also like to say that I think the committee itself has done a good job on this occasion, given the limited time. I would like to congratulate the staff of the JCPA associated with that because they have played an important role yet again. I would like to congratulate TLIP, the private sector representatives who took part in the consideration of these issues, for doing what on short notice was a competent job in an area that will certainly require further consideration in the years to come. I would also like to congratulate James Catchpole on his forthcoming betrothal. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposed amendment to the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill relates to robots and machine tools and is another example of an opportunity forgone for this industry. I would like the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) who is at the table to understand the massive shift that has occurred in the Australian economy in the last 10 years in the direction of manufacturing and manufacturing for export. Since the mid&hyphen;1980s, manufactured exports have come to constitute 31 per cent of total exports&mdash;and that is up from 19 per cent. It is also predicted that, with the right sorts of industry policies in place, this percentage could be over 50 per cent by the year 2010.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not to say that we will move away from our natural resource base, but it is to argue that we have to do more to it before it leaves the country. We have to value add, and we cannot do that without a manufacturing industry, we cannot do it without innovation and we cannot do it without the support
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2184"> mechanisms which get industries into that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The category in the national accounts that refers to the higher tech manufactures, the elaborately transformed manufactures or ETMs, in the same period has in fact almost doubled, going from 11 per cent to 20 per cent. I would ask that the minister not be frivolous about this because, whether he understands it or not, he has carriage for manufacturing industry, in fact for all industry in this country, although he seems only ever interested in the tourism side of his portfolio with his various visits around the place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the real issue is whether Australia wants a slice of the action. The growth in world trade is in elaborately transformed manufactures. Australia has shown a capacity to get into that field but, unless we actively encourage that, assist industry, support them and get into the marketplace, we will not be part of the action. All the other countries with whom we compete are giving assistance to their industries, so there is no such thing as a level playing field. It is true that we have to achieve a level playing field but, before we get there, there has to be recognition of support mechanisms for the companies that are trying to compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the groups which make up elaborately transformed manufactures has been in this area of robots and machine tooling. In the last three years this industry has increased its production by 50 per cent, increased its exports by 200 per cent and, indeed, its exports have grown by 20 per cent each year over the last 10 years. And why? Because Labor was prepared to put in place an environment and assistance that enabled them to get there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that assistance has now been cut away. These industries directly support employees in suburbs close to me&mdash;Preston, Coburg, Moorabbin and Dandenong&mdash;in industries that did not exist before Labor's strategy of encouraging this type of manufacture. But it does not stop with the direct activity. We have to understand what these companies do. They are at the high tech end in terms of technology and innovation. Take laser cutting which is important in terms of manufacturing
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> processes associated with steel, textiles and shipbuilding. So it is not just an important industry in its own right; there is the impact it has on those other industries which we are also getting into export activity in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that increasingly manufacturing is being driven by technology. That requires encouragement for software development, the process activity part of it, as well as the innovation. Yet these are programs that have been cut by this minister. He has cut the bounty, cut the R&amp;D and has left industry to do it on its own. But they will not do it on their own. These are companies that, because of the activity they get into, require longer lead times for the investment to mature. That is why we have to take active steps to get them into the game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister thinks that his policies are working, he should reflect on the latest national accounts figures, published yesterday. What we have is a graphic example of his policies driving our manufacturing sector into reverse. In the last quarter alone we saw the manufacturing industry's production slump by 2.6 per cent. Let's just put this in some sort of contrast. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> In Labor's last term, from the March quarter of 1993 to the March quarter of 1996, manufacturing output under us increased by 9.6 per cent, underpinning GDP growth of 13.8 per cent. Understand the importance of that. We were able to achieve economic growth of better than four per cent. That is why we got unemployment down. We had not solved the unemployment problem but we had punched a big hole in it. We got it down from over 11 per cent to just over eight per cent and we were on track to get it down to five per cent. That is only because we were encouraging economic growth and only because we were prepared to recognise the importance of the manufacturing sector to securing economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what has happened since the election? Since the March quarter, since this government was elected, manufacturing output has gone down. Under Labor, manufacturing output went up; it has only taken them nine months in office to see it go down. What is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2185"> worse is that the biggest slump has occurred in the last quarter: a 2.6 per cent fall in manufacturing output&mdash;and this after the massive cuts into industry programs brought about in the last budget. The announcements made by the government in the budget have put all these investments on hold because those in the manufacturing industry do not know where they stand with the bounties, they have been told they are not going to get the R&amp;D expenditure deductions and they have had their Export Market Development Grants Scheme cut. They have had all sorts of programs cut from them&mdash;$3.9 billion in cuts&mdash;and that is why there is a slump in the manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder that industry is calling for you to be replaced. You have failed them. More to the point, you have betrayed them because you pretended in the last election that you would support them. You went to the election saying you would retain these programs and, as soon as you got into office, you dudded them. You turned around and said, `All of these programs are business welfare. You do not deserve it. Get out and do it on your own.' Well, you can see from the figures released yesterday the impact of your strategy. You are driving manufacturing into reverse and you sit there and shake you head. You will not even get up and defend the basis on which you have cut these programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the machine tools and robots industry, your own Industry Commission recommended the continuation of this bounty&mdash;and you ignored them. You commission reports into the future of the industry, they advise you on a course of action and you ignore them. Why? Because the Treasurer is driving your agenda. You tell us that you are always in there fighting against the Treasurer, that you are taking on Peter Costello. But you are a wimp. You get done every time. So you go around whispering to people, `Come in and help me. I'm getting done by all these Treasury fellows in there.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that you cannot win an argument. That is why the manufacturing industry has given up on you. They happen to think you are a nice bloke. They do not mind you going to lunch at their boardroom table.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> But you are totally ineffective, Minister. You might be decent company for them but they are looking for more than that. They are looking for a future for their industry. They are looking for a vision for the manufacturing industry and they are looking for a partnership with government. Labor delivered that partnership and Labor delivered growth. It delivered growth in terms of the economy as a whole, it delivered growth in terms of manufactured exports and, most importantly, it delivered jobs growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot solve our current account and we cannot solve our unemployment problem unless we generate net exports. You cannot generate net exports on free market ideology because Australia is too small a marketplace. It suffers from distance and you have to compensate for the distance we are from overseas markets. We did have a policy that was about protecting inwards in the days of Black Jack McEwen and the previous tory government. But Labor opened up the economy. We opened it up to global trade and we were succeeding. The harsh reality is that you are driving it into reverse. This industry is a classic example of yet another one that is going to suffer under your inane policies. I just hope that you have a look at these statistics. Get some analysis done by your department; get it to do something constructive in showing you how you have driven manufacturing backwards in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2187"> for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). He comes in here and laughs that this is his lunchtime entertainment. The problem is, Minister, it might be lunchtime theatre for you, but you are an observer, not a player, and as the minister you should be playing seriously. That is why the industry will not take you seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, I was tempted to think, as you were bumbling through your lines over there, as you always do, that in this debate you are like that little person who sits in the semicircle, helping people who have forgotten their lines. That is what you have been reduced to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bounty that we are dealing with on this occasion relates to the shipbuilding industry of this country. There have been many indefensible decisions taken by this government in scrapping bounties but, of all of them, the shipbuilding bounty is the most indefensible. Why? Because it is an industry which has seen production grow by 200 per cent under Labor's program, exports grow by 150 per cent and employment grow by 50 per cent. It has created jobs in regional Australia: in Tasmania, in Fremantle, in Darwin and in Adelaide. It currently employs 3,000 people directly and 10,000 indirectly&mdash;and they are going to wipe it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already, Austal Ships, a Fremantle fast catamaran builder in Western Australia, has announced, because of this decision, the lay&hyphen;off of 300 people. In Tasmania, this shipbuilding industry is the largest single private employer in the state. We see at the table the member for Braddon, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), selling out Tasmania again. You are a disgrace in your representation of Tasmania because you will not stand up for jobs, you will not stand up for regional development and you let the minister go into cabinet and get rolled by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) every time because he does not have the capacity to win the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need is a change of minister, but you will not get any change of direction from the Liberal Party. They are committed to this free market ideological approach, to the belief that the level playing field exists when it does not. What do we have in the shipbuilding
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry? A circumstance in which our shipbuilders have to compete on a five per cent bounty with companies in Norway at 14 per cent bounty, Denmark at 13 per cent and Italy at 25 per cent.</PARA>

That is why I said you were so hypocritical, so stupid, so inane; and yet you are the industry minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just go to the agreement that we were able to force you to. You agreed to extend the ships bounty not back to the period we indicated, which was June of this year, but to December. But you know what he told the industry at the time? The minister and Mr Costello, in a press release they put out announcing the backdown on the ships bounty, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extension of the shipbuilding bounty to the 31 December aligns assistance for Australian shipbuilding industry with key overseas competitors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It does not. And you know why? Because, under the Australian arrangement that he is putting in through this legislation, the industry has to have completed the vessel by the end of this year. These things take 12 months to build, so unless the order was there before
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2188"> Christmas they have no hope of getting it&mdash;and the order was not there before Christmas because they had frozen the bounty.</PARA>

He has told them that he will align them with the OECD, but he has ratted on them again.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shipbuilding industry in Western Australia has, for the last handful of years, been a thriving export industry. It has created jobs in Fremantle and south of Fremantle and it has created exports. It is a vibrant, vital exporting industry. And what does this government do in respect of the shipbuilding industry? Exactly and precisely what it does in respect of any government measure to enhance export or trade or industry&mdash;it guts it.</PARA>

Whether it is research and development, whether it is a bounty, whether it is export market development grants or whether it is DIFF, it is debacle after debacle. It is anti&hyphen;export, anti&hyphen;jobs and, in this case, it is anti&hyphen;Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People do not need to rely upon my assertions or those of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) for this point to be made crystal clear. We saw in Tuesday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> an article entitled `$275m in lost exports: Angry ASA chairman blames Budget cutbacks.' It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a stinging rebuke of Government policy, ASA chairman Mr John Rothwell has told the Industry
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister, Mr John Moore, that Australian shipbuilders were now at a "huge disadvantage" to their European competitors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The effects of the government's measure will be job losses in Western Australia, lost exports and a substantial diminishing of the international competitiveness of Australia's shipbuilding industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 26 February entitled `Warning on ship jobs' there are comments by Wavemaster and Austal Ships, both Western Australian shipbuilding companies, with Austal Ships warning that 300 of its 800 workers would lose their jobs after July on the basis of and, as a direct result of, the government's measures in this bill. The Western Australian Minister for Commerce and Trade, and Leader of the National Party at the state level, described this particular measure as `bloody nonsense'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) likes to parade to the community that he is a big supporter of industry. But we saw in the hit list story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> last weekend that it is really a complete admission of failure.

He is not capable of standing up to the economic rationalists in the cabinet&mdash;the Melbourne and Sydney lawyers and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, who defeats the industry minister time after time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I oppose this particular measure. It is an example of where, as far as the industry minister is concerned, `Moore means less': less export and fewer jobs. This measure is anti&hyphen;exports, anti&hyphen;jobs and anti&hyphen;Western Australian.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to correct the shadow minister for trade: it is not only anti&hyphen;Western Australian and anti&hyphen;Tasmanian, it is also anti&hyphen;South Australian. The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 exposes for all to see that, when it comes to shipbuilding in this country, this government, this minister, are suffering from a bewildering and monumental policy blindness. As far as shipbuilding is concerned, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) cannot be anything
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2189"> but a tabula rasa. When it comes to shipbuilding and manufacturing, Australia is becoming terra incognita. We are really becoming a dark continent. This is a foolhardy measure and it displays for all to see the continuation of the coalition's apathy towards anything in the manufacturing industry and shipbuilding in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It continues a trend when the coalition was last in government. In its last year in government, eight per cent of jobs in manufacturing were just swept away and now it is doing it in the first years of its new coalition government. Shipbuilding is a success story and the minister is about to apply a blow torch to it. It appears that increased production, increased exports and increased jobs in shipbuilding do nothing for this government and do nothing for this minister. The manufacturing industry, under Labor, increased its exports by over 400 per cent. But, under this government and this minister, it is simply wallowing away. It believes government should get out of the way. Government wants no role in business or manufacturing or anything to do with shipbuilding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is completely negative on anything to do with the shipbuilding industry. The responsible minister is ignored in cabinet. He has been sidelined permanently and he needs to be replaced. It is a terrible message that you, Minister, and this government are sending to the shipbuilding industry and to manufacturing in general. The abolition of the shipbuilding bounty defies commonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wants a five per cent cut in support to Australian builders of vessels, nearly all of which, as the shadow minister for trade pointed out, are exported. The Australian shipbuilding industry is a world leader in high&hyphen;speed catamaran production. Look at the success story: production up 200 per cent; exports up 150 per cent; employment up 50 per cent&mdash;it is a great story, Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the government's response? Give it a belt around the ears! Do not be concerned with jobs, or growth, or progress, or the battling families which this government so fraudulently purported to support at the last election. As the shadow minister pointed out,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> how is Australian shipbuilding expected to compete against Scandinavian countries with around 13 per cent and 14 per cent, and Italy with 25 per cent, if this country's rate is at zero?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Would anybody in the USA or European countries follow this sort of economic madness? The USA is not going to agree to this OECD agreement. This minister shows no consistency. He gives $23 million to Shell and BHP so they can import ships built in Holland, but he gives nothing to Australian shipbuilders. He will not even give them $9 million.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to see some response to the industry's concerns about the shipbuilding bounty. The basis of the extension of the bounty to 31 December&mdash;the only revelation that was in the short combined press release of the minister and the Treasurer (Mr Costello)&mdash;was that this was to enable our arrangements to conform to the OECD agreement. As the Australian Shipbuilders Association said on behalf of the industry, that is not the case. In his contribution to this debate, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) put the position of the ASA, but the minister refuses to address these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition is asking the Minister, on behalf of the Australian workers who are working in a very successful industry, an industry which is now export directed, is to indicate what the future will bring. What if the OECD agreement is not fully ratified? What about the inconsistency between the agreement and the provisions of this bill? When will that be addressed? When can the shipbuilding industry act in the knowledge that it is operating on a level playing field? When will the industry find that free trade does equate to fair trade?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because this bounty only goes to the end of this year it is likely, as has been said repeatedly, that jobs in this particular industry will go offshore. What Australian manufacturers want the minister to say is what he will do to prevent jobs going overseas. What will he do to protect Australian jobs? As the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) has said in his contribution, it gives a very bad signal to not only the shipbuilding industry but to other industries as well because there are big tests just around the corner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a big test for this minister and a big test for his government in its reaction to the Productivity Commission report on the automobile industry. The other big decision that has to be made is in relation to the pharmaceutical industry and the response to the continuation to the factor F plan. In both those cases, industry plans that have been successful have driven those two particular industries into an export orientation. Those plans have ensured that there has been job growth and ensured that Australia has entered overseas markets in a competitive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the government going to do to ensure that those industries continue to grow? It is not only the protection of the present numbers of employees or the present trades that they have at the moment, it is the potential for increase, the potential for ensuring that successful industry sectors can continue to grow that is so important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disappointing that whilst the minister has sat through the consideration in detail stage of this bill&mdash;and I applaud him for his stamina in doing that&mdash;he has not entered the debate. He has just gone through the formal motions of putting his amendments. He could have saved a lot of the parliament's time if he had addressed those issues that have been raised by the opposition. It all gets back to the one question. What this minister is being asked is: what will he do to protect Australian jobs? What will he do to support Australian industry to ensure that it has levels of employment that will increase? If he has set a target for manufacturing industry then he will not reach that target unless he takes appropriate action to ensure that those jobs are protected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on this bill, the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. I join with the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) in expressing the Labor Party's concern about a government decision that is going to result in the export of Australian jobs. The member for Scullin is correct, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has failed yet again. The reality is that as a result of this decision we have undermined our capacity to maintain a decent shipbuilding industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that Australia, as an island nation, should be giving support to the shipbuilding industry. The truth of the matter is that as a result of this government's decision, Australian shipbuilders will only receive the bounty for ships until 31 December this year even though, for example, the average car ferry&mdash;our main export&mdash;takes around 12 months to construct. That is what we offer to Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What occurs overseas? We hear the government concern about mainstream Australia at the moment, about ensuring that there is a level playing field. This is what a level playing field means in the mind of the minister. While we are denied assistance beyond 31 December this year, European and overseas shipbuilders will continue to receive the bounty and assistance of between nine and 25 per cent for at least another three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister wants the Australian shipbuilding industry to believe that there is no impact as a result of this decision. I will tell you what: it is a national impact. It extends across the length and breadth of Australia. Not just our coastline but also our industry inland depends on the shipbuilding industry for the purposes of fabrication of parts used in the shipbuilding industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to the state of Tasmania. Unemployment is at 10.2 per cent. This is not of concern to the minister or the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), but of concern to Tasmania and of concern to Australia at large. What will
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this decision do to the largest private sector employer in Tasmania, Incat, one of Tasmania's most successful shipbuilding enterprises? I know, for example, that the Prime Minister, when he goes to Tasmania, likes to stroll around Incat's shipbuilding yards, to glow in the glory of the success on the employment front, one of the bright spots on the employment front in Tasmania. I'll tell you what: he will not be welcomed there by the shipbuilding industry, especially those workers and their families, in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This decision will not only sabotage employment opportunities in Tasmania, it will sabotage the expansion program of this company. The company has already had its capacity to employ young people undermined by government decisions, following a decision which says that because it employs 100 people already, it cannot access ancillary payments for new apprentices to the firm. I might also say in passing that Incat has already lost innovative research program assistance as a result of changes in previous government decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shipbuilding bounty is an investment in jobs. It is an investment in the industry that Australia, as an island nation, ought to support. If the bill is passed, the shipbuilding bounty goes at the end of the year. The whole basis of the firm's expansion to European and Asian markets will be kicked from underneath it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that from the minister's point of view that is probably of little worth to him, because he is not too interested in inspecting shipbuilding yards in Tasmania. But I can already see the itinerary of the trip overseas to inspect foreign shipyards because he will have exported Australian jobs to foreign shipyards. It will be a good itinerary. He will trip around the world and look at ships that we will be importing to Australia, having successfully undermined the capacity of Australian industry to grow, to export and to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time the Australian community sent the message loud and clear to the minister and the cabinet. Its anti&hyphen;job strategy is unacceptable. The revised employment figures just released today clearly show that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2192"> the employment growth is not as good as the Treasurer at the dispatch box a couple of weeks ago led the Australian community to believe. Vote for Australian jobs; vote for the Labor party proposal to extend the bounty and ensure that industries such as those in Tasmania that are vitally concerned with the future of the shipbuilding industry are protected, so that we protect Australian jobs and support mainstream Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is to be condemned. Frankly, rather than planning overseas trips to look at foreign shipyards, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism ought to be concerned about Australian jobs and Australian families. Companies such as Incat are companies we are proud of. It extends to South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, to name a few states. It is about all Australians benefiting from bounties that give assistance to Australian industries. It is about decent industry policy; it is about the future of Australia; it is about regional Australia; it is about jobs and job growth. We need it as a nation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I tell you why you have reneged, Minister, and I want you to take note of this because I want you to use the last five minutes to defend your outrageous position. When you announced the backdown on the ships bounty, you wrote to the Australian Shipbuilders Association outlining what the OECD arrangements were, and you said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commitments made to support shipbuilding prior to the date of entry into force continue, provided that a vessel is delivered within three years from the date of commitment. A commitment made in January 1997 would apply to a vessel delivered by January 2000.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what you wrote and said to the Australian shipbuilders industry. In case it is news to you, I can hand you a copy of your letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next important step in this equation&mdash;keep this in mind, Minister&mdash;is that you told them what the OECD arrangements were. They could finish within three years of entering the arrangements. In the press release that you issued with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announcing the backdown, you said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extension of the shipbuilding bounty to 31 December 1997 aligns assistance for the Australian shipbuilding industry with key overseas competitors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Little wonder that, when members of the Australian Shipbuilders Association saw your subsequent announcement, they sent a letter back to you on 14 February which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seemed, just prior to Christmas, that the industry was back on a level playing field with its OECD country competitors after some sensible reconsidering by the government. That has proven not to be the case. The government has failed to address the issue correctly and, once again, the industry faces turmoil and a very uncertain future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 12 February, in a press release headed `Clayton's shipbuilding bounty', the same organisation had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the industry was initially very excited and relieved by the announcement, it has proved to be nothing more than a disappointing teaser and, in reality, of no value at all. With construction time of an average car ferry being around 12 months, this effectively means that presently no shipbuilder can enter into a contract to build a ship with the aid of a bounty. It is regrettable that, due to previous deliberations by the government, our industry has lost substantial contracts with a total value exceeding $275 million.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Understand this: the cost to budget was $9 million, and Australia loses $275 million. Great investment, Minister! You dabble in the share market&mdash;or you used to until we forced you out of it&mdash;and I am sure you would not think that was a great return on the dividend. The Australian Shipbuilders Association goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austel Ships was faced with shedding 300 of their 800&hyphen;strong work force, with many other yards downsizing proportionately. The issue of moving operations offshore has reignited as a serious option for future viability.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2193">  </PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">You are decimating this industry, but worst of all you are deceiving them. You tell them that you will reverse the decision, and then you do not implement that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, did you write to them telling them of the OECD position? Did you, in announcing the backdown, say that the extension was based on, and aligned Australians with, the OECD position? Why have you reneged on that agreement? You have an obligation to this House, in which you are accountable. If you do not answer, you will be seen as a deceitful person who is not prepared to back his decision. You are required to come into this place and explain yourself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have betrayed the manufacturing industry but, worst of all, you have deceived the shipbuilding industry of this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1996 mirrors the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1995 introduced by the previous government. The bill arose in response to the decision of the New South Wales Supreme Court in the Crawford House Press case, which identified an anomaly in the voluntary administration scheme for companies experiencing financial problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill's primary aim is to allow recognition of the debts incurred while a company is under a deed of company agreement, voluntary administration, by the liquidator as debts or claims that are provable in a winding up situation. The Crawford decision found that under the existing law this is only possible where the scheme is undertaken by an appointed administrator, and not the company itself, as was the case in Crawford. The bill rectifies this but does not afford any priority to new creditors when a company is under a deed of company agreement. The issue of priority remains a contentious one in a legal sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also contains a retrospective provision to protect liquidators who have interpreted the Corporations Law as originally intended when the voluntary administration scheme was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1995 bill raised the question of priority for creditors of a company after it has entered a deed of company agreement. Where the deed allowed for the appointment of an administrator, it was accepted that any new
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debts were provable and received priority in any subsequent liquidation. However, the Crawford case held that if debt is incurred by the directors of a company in lieu of an administrator, the debts not only do not rank but are not provable. The proposed legislation will allow such debts to be provable but not with any priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of the 1995 bill, the then justice minister, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), argued that this issue was complex and needed more detailed consideration. The bill, he suggested, was not intended to make any substantive changes to the operation of the law. Although the current government has taken a similar approach with the identical 1996 bill, it has made clear its intentions to refer the matter to the Legal Committee of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. The government's rationale for pursuing the same bill is centred around certainty and stability in the knowledge that a number of insolvency practitioners have been operating on the assumption that the 1995 bill would become law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the issue of priority, the opposition sees no other points of contention in this particular piece of legislation. This bill is essentially giving legislative effect to an established common law principle and proposes amendments to the Corporations Law. I take this opportunity, however, to make some observations on the government's recent approach to a number of issues in amending the Australian Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two days ago, for instance, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was widely reported for his supposedly tough stance against `the excesses of the 1980s'. He claimed that people `should remember the excesses of the past and use them as an example to curtail their animal spirits'. The irony is that corporate excesses are not a thing of the past: they are alive in the present, illustrated in the form of the obscene remuneration of company directors and executives which plagues any notion of corporate responsibility in this country. It is an issue which the government has sought to conveniently sweep under the carpet but it is one which will not go away.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2195">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer has said of novice investors, `We don't want their first experiment with equities to be a nasty one. We want it to be a safe and encouraging one,' as if the majority of Australians have money to burn in the same way as the government's shareholder&hyphen;rich front bench.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These issues are of major concern&mdash;corporate responsibility and the level of corporate salaries being paid throughout Australia&mdash;in working class electorates such as mine and yours, Madam Deputy Speaker. These questions of public morality and double standards raise a great deal of interest. At a time when ordinary Australian workers are being forced to exercise wage restraint, chief executive officers in Australia are being offered, and are accepting, lavish remuneration packages which most Australians will never see in their lifetime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we have from this government is an ineffective response which, according to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), sets out an edict that if you are not a shareholder in a unit trust then you are, by definition, a public sector bludger. At a time when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is promoting open competition in the labour market, competition is limited to a select few when it comes to corporate Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this government, Australian workers will not see a real pay rise for a long time. We are confronted with this government's ideological obsession with labour market deregulation and its opposition to the concept of a living wage. Yet the government has done nothing in this legislation and nothing in the Treasurer's public statements to restrict the obscene level of chief executive officers' salaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has completely avoided the question of legislative and non&hyphen;legislative means to address this important issue. Equally, the Treasurer's recent comments advocating corporate governance failed to address good corporate morality in the regulation of public companies, where the issue of director and executive salaries is an important part of the overall debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disclosure in October 1996 that a CEO of Coles&hyphen;Myer received a $1.2 million rise in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> salary&mdash;increasing it to $2.8 million in the previous financial year&mdash;resulted in widespread public criticism. For instance, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> quoted one institutional investor as having said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Bartels package was obscene given that Coles' earnings and share price had, on average, underperformed on the All Ordinaries Index since his appointment four years ago.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This view, spread right throughout the community, highlights the fact that the investment and public community believes that any additional remuneration paid to directors and executives ought to be performance based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate over the level and composition of executive salaries has aroused several sources of concern through the years. On one hand, it is argued that remuneration packages offered by Australian companies must be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors and managers of the highest quality. Advocates of this view believe the performance of companies in any country and its consequence in the economy depends to a large extent on the directors and senior executives who direct them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand&mdash;and this is the view that I would argue&mdash;shareholders and other employers of companies have a right to expect a proper balance between the need to offer incentives to top management and the incentives to other employees for their contribution to the success of the corporation, particularly when ordinary wage earners are being called upon constantly to exercise wage restraint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Associated with these employee rights, the general public also has an interest as consumers&mdash;an interest in making sure that they are not victims of price inflation driven by the excessive remuneration packages paid to directors and senior executives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the question of overseas comparisons. In 1995, two reports were published in the United Kingdom as a result of public and shareholder concerns with executive salaries&mdash;the Greenbury report and the Report of the Employment Committee of the House of Commons. The former highlighted serious deficiencies in the existing provisions for disclosure of directors' remu
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2196"> neration in the UK Companies Act. One of its major recommendations was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the way forward . . . lies not in statutory controls, which would at best be unnecessary and at worst harmful, but in action to strengthen accountability and encourage enhanced performance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Much significance was also attached to the need for full disclosure and that individual directors' remuneration should detail all elements in the packages of each individual director by name and ought to include the value of pension and other benefit entitlements earned. This is an important point in the companies law: that full disclosure of the full extent of remuneration should be in the public interest, fully part of the public accountability process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House of Commons report concluded that formal regulation of levels of executive pay is unlikely to be effective nor desirable and recommended that the disclosure requirements laid down in the stock exchange rules be consolidated into the Companies Act for large companies. In Australia, of course, we accept those recommendations because of constitutional provisions which make it very difficult to directly regulate the level of executive pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was further recommended, though, that shareholders be given the right to approve any new incentive schemes for the directors of publicly listed companies. The report cited the practice in the United States&mdash;a practice which should be of great interest to the House&mdash;where shareholders vote regularly on the adoption or renewal of share option schemes and on certain cash bonus plans. Most importantly, the Employment Committee saw a greater and active role for institutional investors influencing companies towards best practice in corporate governance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The US requirements for disclosure of executive pay are often hailed as instructive for Australian purposes. The US has strongly embraced the restructuring of executive remuneration along the lines of performance based indicators. This is supported by the US tax system, which disallows corporate tax deductions for remuneration exceeding $1
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million per annum unless it is performance based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That echoes a point I made in debate just a few days ago, that when we talk about reciprocal responsibilities in Australia it should not only apply to the social welfare sector. The allocation of government resources for business related purposes means that those corporations have a very important social responsibility in how they use government assistance. They should not be using government industry assistance to strip down companies, to minimise tax, to engage in public immorality, or to engage in poor practices of corporate governance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Corporate Australia needs to be as socially responsible as any part of the social welfare sector and, at a time when the government is talking about work for the dole and the Prime Minister talks the language of social responsibilities, why aren't those responsibilities also being extended to corporate Australia? What is good for the social welfare sector should also be good for the business welfare sector. That is an important principle to which the Australian Labor Party adheres and will be trying to advance in debates in the House for many years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning now to the deficiencies in other areas in the Australian Corporations Law, section 239 of the law provides for disclosure in limited instances. Information pertaining to director and executive remuneration is also derived from schedule 5, which provides for a limited and inadequate form of disclosure. The absence of any requirement that the component parts of remuneration packages be disclosed is a major defect in its provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shareholders have a legitimate interest in knowing the company's remuneration policies, the proportion of individual packages which are performance based, and the criteria for measuring performance. At present, schedule 5 disclosure provides no information on any of these significant matters, a very real public concern which the government should be addressing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the government to introduce reforms in this area. Australia's current disclosure rules for director and executive remuneration clearly lag behind the transparency advocated
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2197"> by international standards, particularly in the United States. An Australian author on this subject, Jennifer Hill, has argued that recent developments in remuneration have attempted to align the interests of the shareholders and the self-interest of company officers by creating remuneration packages where both groups have an interest in making the company successful. One technique for achieving this alignment is to link a substantial proportion of executive remuneration to corporate performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need to update our disclosure requirements is clear. The increasing internationalisation of security markets makes it imperative that Australian standards of corporate governance keep pace with international developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer, in his approach to corporate governance, cannot have it both ways. He cannot claim to be a reformer of corporate governance, yet choose to ignore a pivotal issue in the debate, that is, the question of disclosure for executive and director salaries. The Treasurer has made clear his belief that the Corporations Law should be viewed through an economic construct, yet in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 28 January he preached the value of `legal and ethical requirements'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This creates an interesting contradiction. On one hand, the coalition has argued that there is much to commend the economic analysis of Corporations Law, hence its shift just after the last election to the Treasury portfolio. A necessary by&hyphen;product of this paradigm suggests that the corporation has a duty to maximise profits for shareholders, possibly instigating some harsh economic objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, the pursuit of any social objectives are severely undermined by the constraints of the purely profit maximising economic model. Achieving the correct balance between legal requirements and self-regulatory codes of conduct is an aspect which the government should be willing to address in the remuneration debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are numerous options available to this government to address the issue of executive remuneration, a by&hyphen;product of which will be the promotion of the principles of corporate
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accountability and corporate responsibility. This is one of the great advantages of promoting full disclosure and assumes added weight, given that shareholders have the ability, under corporate governance theory, to remove directors with whom they are dissatisfied; that is, disclosure of remuneration allows shareholders to better assess the board's performance and remuneration policies and to carry out their role as corporate monitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another benefit of disclosure is that it is less interventionary than other methods designed to control the level of remuneration, such as encouraging judicial limits on remuneration or, as in the United States, placing an indirect cap of $1 million on non&hyphen;performance based remuneration under the tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The options I have briefly outlined are open to the government. I urge them to address the remuneration issue as integral to any examination of corporate governance and any debate relating to amendments to the Corporations Law. If it is good enough to apply this question of social responsibility in the social welfare sector, it should also be applied in the business welfare sector when it comes to the Corporations Law and when it comes to the framing of reciprocal responsibilities in industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If government is providing assistance, corporations throughout Australia have a social responsibility to make the best, socially responsible use of that assistance. We have seen too much in Australia of the excesses of companies that do not bear a proper weight of social responsibility. The Treasurer talks about those excesses as if they are a thing of the past. In fact, they are a thing of the present. When I talk to ordinary Australians in my electorate, as you would do in your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, about the level of executive salaries, they sense the public immorality of the double standard: the wage restraint for the ordinary PAYE taxpayer and wage earner compared with some of the obscene levels of salary that are being paid at the top end of town. It is time for the government to not only apply social responsibilities to one part of the Australian community, but to do it across the board. </PARA>

It is tough because not only do you have to contend with the ups and downs of the market and the many vagaries of the domestic consumption, but businesses have to deal with bankers, creditors, debtors, suppliers and all sorts of government departments for every operation of the business. They have to contend with accountants, advisers, insurance agents, credit agents and, of course, unions&mdash;those marvellous organisations who remain in the jurassic era of industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doing business in Australia is quite tough. When everyone and everything seems to be against you and a little bit of sunshine appears on the profit horizon, another whack seems to come your way. Some say Australia is the toughest market in the world in which to do business. Some say that if you are successful in business in Australia, then you would be successful anywhere else in the world. I would agree with that notion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian business operators are the most resourceful in the world, and given the chance we are better than any international competitor. Business is tough in Australia. One of the reasons it can be tough is because many of the business men and women who determine business principle and policy are those that do not risk their own funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Risking your money, Madam Deputy Speaker, is the ultimate leading edge feeling. The ultimate buzz in anything is risking your own money: putting it all on the line, risking the house, risking the family, risking security, having the will to go through start up, the will to risk it all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Someone once said that nothing can withstand the will that stakes its very existence on its achievement. In other words, `I'll do it or I'll die. I'll climb that mountain or I'm not coming back.' Strange things seem to happen to people who risk their existence on their activities, and things do in fact happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia many small businesses are in fact facing their mountains at the moment. They need a hand, and this bill goes a small
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> way in providing that support. I do not begrudge those policy makers who sit in their high&hyphen;back chairs gambling with other people's money. But that is a bit easy. Gambling with other people's money is really the ultimate pure power, but there is nothing more powerful than gambling with other people's money, other people's investment, other people's future and other people's lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gambling in business is part of business, and that is why it is so tough. But the risk and the pure passion in business comes when it is your own money. That is why we need this legislation. We need any legislation that protects investment. Be it a creditor investment or a plain operational investment, this type of protection is in fact good. It is good for those involved, good for healthy business practice and good for business investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June 1995, Justice Cohen of the New South Wales Supreme Court held in the Crawford House Press case that, where persons are dealing with a company under a deed of company arrangement, as opposed to dealing with the deed administrator, and that company moves into liquidation, those persons may not make a claim in winding up for any outstanding liabilities of the company in relation to those dealings. This is totally unacceptable. In other words, if you are dealing with a company under a deed and you are supplying a service, some money, a product, or whatever it might be, you would lose it. You would not have any claim to that if that company was wound up. That is totally unacceptable, and that is what this bill is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a view no doubt agreed to by many members of this particular House and others within the professions dealing with these types of issues. In fact, Justice Cohen stated that the result of the case was not the intention of the legislation and called for urgent legislative amendments to the act. Industry bodies, the legal and insolvency profession and informed commentators have supported the call for amendments. In October 1995, the previous government, under the stewardship of the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), the former minister, brought to the House amendments designed to overcome problems associ
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2199"> ated with the act uncovered by the Crawford case. However, the bill failed to pass through the House prior to the 1996 election and accordingly lapsed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 5.3A of the previous Corporations Law, which commenced in June 1993, provided for companies to enter into a scheme known as voluntary administration. This scheme allows a company in financial difficulty to enter into what is called a deed of company arrangement with its creditors. This is seen as a more flexible form of administration as opposed to other forms of external administration. This enables the company to continue trading for a period with a view to producing a better return for creditors than would be available if the company was wound up immediately. Using this method can ideally result in saving the business of the company with its creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very easy for a business to get into trouble, and this costs the economy through the crumbling of the small business sector, ultimately impacting upon employment and other social issues of the community. As mentioned in the second reading speech, this bill seeks to effect two substantive changes to the Corporations Act 1989. The first amendment proposed by the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1996 is designed to ensure that debts incurred by the company while under a deed of company arrangement are admissible to proof against the company in a subsequent liquidation of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second amendment will validate acts done by liquidators prior to the commencement of these amendments; in other words, there is a retrospective approach to it. On that basis, debts incurred by a company while under a deed of company arrangement were admissible to proof. The liquidators may have done such acts in ignorance of the irregularity in the Corporations Law which the bill is designed to correct or in anticipation of the passage of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation recognises the other side of the business coin, and that is the creditors; those businesses which may invest time, product or finance in good faith to a struggling business yet have no security of their investment. The bill will financially benefit
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the creditors, including government creditors, of companies which are liquidated immediately following a period under a deed of company arrangement. In particular, the amendments will ensure that creditors who have dealt with a company under a deed of company arrangement will be able to prove, in a liquidation of the company following termination of the deed, for outstanding debts and claims arising while the company was under deed. We need these amendments because it will help business. Government understands the needs of business and wishes to respond to these needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the high&hyphen;rolling 1980s we are all only too aware of the dangers associated with businesses and corporations that allow their debts to get so far out of control. The whole economy suffers as a result. In my own home state of Western Australia, a previous Labor government continued to bail out big businesses to such an extent that the ones that had to do the bailing out in the end were the taxpayers. We have already seen the damage done when wily failed businessmen appear to miraculously have their assets suddenly appear under the names of their trusts, spouses, children or in fact relatives leaving a substantial amount of assets that are unable to be dissolved to pay their millions of dollars worth of debt.</PARA>

By the time the Leader of the Opposition has held that position for a couple of years, there will be an encyclopaedia of contradicting statements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question and for her interest in the topic. In fact, I am going to the electorate of Makin tomorrow, and I look forward to a good day in the member's electorate and seeing for myself the good work that she does as the member for Makin. She is one of a large number of quality members on this side of the parliament. I particularly appreciate the question because it is timely. I met last night with the public sector unions and had a general discussion with them about the processes which the government proposes to discuss further, both the reform of the Public Service Act&mdash;in fact, its complete rewrite&mdash;and the processes for industrial arrangements generally in the APS in the period ahead. We had a pretty long meeting&mdash;a couple of hours or thereabouts. Obviously there are a lot of points which will need further amplification and clarification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also pleased to see in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> this morning a statement referring to Doug Lilley of the CPSU&mdash;Wendy is in Geneva, apparently. He is said to have said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The position had been imposed on the unions as a fait accompli outside of the negotiations surrounding changes to the Public Service Act and on that basis the unions would probably have to live with the government's decision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Generally speaking, the tone of the meeting was good and I look forward to further discussions. It is certainly appropriate for the government to be making these changes and proposing them because the fact is that we could do a lot better in human resource management in the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rationale for the government's proposed reforms to the public service is very simple. Although the public sector is obviously different from the private sector, the fact is that they both live in the same world and they both operate within the confines of the Workplace Relations Act, which was passed last year through this parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our objective and our desire is to allow the APS to have flexibility within its management systems so as to take up the opportunities which greater flexibility and management of human resources will provide. Ultimately, that is very good for people who work within the APS. It is certainly appropriate from the taxpayers' point of view to ensure that we deliver services efficiently, and it is good, ultimately, for consumers that we are able to do a better job. The key to the new system is the simple proposition that, above a safety net, individual organisations are best suited to determine their own arrangements for pay and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question also asks: is this is a new concept? The truth of the matter is that it is not. If members go back to 1993 and 1994, I think they will remember that Paul Keating gave a very interesting speech to company directors in Melbourne when he set out his vision for a new industrial relations system.</PARA>

I have been doing my reading of that time and I want to compliment the former Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, Mr Gary Johns, for some of the speeches that he gave on behalf of the frontbench of the now opposition.

So the simple fact is that any person with a chronic illness under your last budget was hit another $200 a year more. So do not give me the cant and hypocrisy as to what happens under the $3 extra a script. It will be paid by people who are infrequent users, and anyone who is a chronic or heavy user is protected.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Bowman for that question and, with International Women's Day in prospect for Saturday, it does give me an opportunity to remind the House of the achievements of this government in fulfilling the election commitments we made. In answering that question, rather than draw upon statements that were made by the coalition in the lead-up to the election, let me for a moment draw upon a statement that was made by the then Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, the current member for Fremantle, when she addressed the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing on 6 September in 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It provides a very interesting benchmark against which we can judge the decisions that have been taken by the coalition government since it was elected. I know that the member for Prospect and many other members opposite are interested in these issues, and I will take a moment to run past the criteria laid down by the former Labor minister the achievements of the coalition government. The member for Fremantle said that from a dialogue with women's groups four priorities emerged. The first was the difficulty women
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2203"> faced balancing work and family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dr Lawrence interjecting&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Don't get too excited; there is quite a while to go. I am quoting you quite faithfully in doing this. The second of the four priorities which emerged was a fear of violence, the third was health and the fourth was the need for more women to enter public life and assume decision making responsibility. Let me start with the last of them first. We have behind us the greatest ever representation in the House of Representatives of women, and it has taken the Liberal and National parties, without the ideologically pursued approach of a quota, to deliver it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have seen the Labor Party look absolute hypocrites. They danced at the conference, they threw the streamers, they burst the balloons; but when it came to a safe seat there was not a woman in sight so far as the Australian Labor Party were concerned. They are hypocrites on the issue of female representation within their ranks. Applying the Carmen Lawrence test, on that fourth priority we have passed with flying colours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go back to the priority of balancing work and family responsibilities. In two major areas the coalition has more than implemented the commitments that were made at the time of the last election. We introduced the family taxation initiative, which has given to many women and men&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Opposition members interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested that those opposite sneer; the smarter ones amongst you do not sneer. You should have been present at a conversation I had with a leading trade unionist only a few weeks ago. When he was talking about the last election he said, `I knew that when you crowd put forward that proposal about a family tax initiative an already difficult task was going to be made impossible. I only wish that Keating and Beazley had had the brains to introduce such a proposal.' Martin Ferguson is nodding over there. Martin knows that I am right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family tax initiative gave enormous additional choice for men and women&mdash;women in particular&mdash;in relation to balancing
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their work and family responsibilities. Of course, we are particularly indebted also to my colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations for the much greater flexibility under the Workplace Relations Act. One of the great aspirations of women in the Australian community is to have more opportunities for permanent part&hyphen;time work so that they can effectively balance their work and family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who stood in the way of greater permanent part&hyphen;time work? It was the trade union movement and the Labor Party. Who swept away the barriers to permanent part-time work? It was the Liberal Party and the Minister for Industrial Relations in the coalition government. So once again, we delivered on the commitment and met the benchmarks&mdash;not our benchmarks, but</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">your benchmarks. The first priority of women, according to your consultations, was to have greater opportunities to balance work and family responsibilities. In those two key areas&mdash;taxation and workplace relations&mdash;the coalition has delivered in spades, and that is why our policies have such wide support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second priority was a fear of violence. Everyone knows the contribution that the national gun control laws have made&mdash;with, I acknowledge, the support of the Labor Party and the support of the states. Everyone in this House knows that some of the strongest supporters of uniform gun control legislation were women, particularly women living in rural and regional areas of Australia. All of us have experienced going into those areas and having women come up and say, `I am so glad you had the courage to introduce those laws. They have changed the atmosphere of violence in the Australian community.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know the member for Prospect does not like this. She absolutely hates this, because she does not like being reminded of the way in which the coalition has performed in these areas. It is not only in relation to gun control. It is also in relation to other areas of crime and violence. We are spending $13 million over three years in relation to areas of crime prevention. We also have a new approach in relation to media
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2204"> violence. We have put more resources into counselling in relation to domestic violence. We have put more resources into counselling in relation to marriage guidance and relationships. Much as the Labor Party does not like it, we have put more resources into these areas. We have given a higher priority to these areas. You talked about it. We have done it. You talked about it all the time, but we have actually done it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of health, listed as the third of the former minister's priorities, from the middle of this year we will be putting up to $450 million into giving people&mdash;individuals, couples and families&mdash;greater incentives to take out private health insurance. There have also been initiatives in the area of superannuation. We have provided greater flexibility in the superannuation system. We have catered for women who are in the work force for a period of time, then go out of it and come back into it. We have recognised the intermittent character of the working lives and the working careers of Australian women. You never did that because the ACTU would not let you do it. The ACTU objected to the flexibility that we have brought in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very proudly may I say to the member for Bowman that in the last 12 months we have kept faith with what we told the women of Australia. But there is more to be done; we do not take any smug or complacent attitude to what has been achieved over the last 12 months. The women of Australia can rest absolutely assured that we are not a government made up of rhetoric; not only are we a government made up of the greatest number of women that have ever represented one side of politics in the history of the Australian federation but also we are a group of people in a government that has delivered and is absolutely committed to the principle of equality of opportunity for men and women in the Australian community.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. I am aware of the articles that appeared in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> . As I explained to the House yesterday, a reprocessing facility using Synroc technology is just one of the options the government is compelled to consider after 13 years of inaction by the Labor government. The fuel used by the ANSTO research reactor comes from the United Kingdom and the United States and under treaties with both countries we have the option of returning the waste fuel to them. Approximately 700 fuel rods are from the United States and 900 are from the United Kingdom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The options not only in regard to cost but also in regard to whether we have to take the waste back from the United Kingdom or the United States as immediate level waste once it has been reprocessed have to be very
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2206"> carefully considered. For instance, the 900 United Kingdom rods would come back to Australia as 250 cubic metres of concreted intermediate waste. If those rods were reprocessed using Synroc, the amount of waste would be but two cubic metres. That is one of the factors to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the information of the House, I should explain that, in basic terms, Synroc, as the name suggests, is a synthetic rock which encases radioactive materials just as rocks do in nature. It effectively traps and immobilises the waste. After a period of time the radioactive by&hyphen;product gradually expires. At the same time, any processing involving Synroc would result in significantly lower amounts of radioactivity than procedures currently in use at ANSTO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is irresponsible for the opposition, the Democrats and the green groups to be scaremongering on the issue. What these groups do is distort the facts and confuse the issues and it is no wonder that some people and some families in the electorate of Hughes are rightly concerned because of the information or misinformation directed at them by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Labor Party did by their inaction was make Lucas Heights a de facto storage site. Then there were the claims of the environmental groups which quite frankly do not make sense. They protest if we store spent fuel, they protest when we ship the spent fuel somewhere else for reprocessing and they protest at any suggestion we reprocess our own spent fuel. Do they also want us to stop carrying out the life saving operations for cancer, thyroid disease and other illnesses? The spent fuel at the centre of this whole issue is a necessary, unavoidable by&hyphen;product of having effective medical treatments in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During this year more than 260,000 Australians will have a nuclear medicine procedure. On average one in two Australians can now expect one in their lifetime. As a result of these procedures, some 35 spent fuel rods are generated by the Lucas Heights research reactor every year. The government knows the seriousness and sensitivities of this whole issue. It does not help the people of Hughes

One of the proudest achievements of this government in its tax reform project since it was elected in March 1996 was to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. That was a decision to make sure the government would not artificially inflate notional income and collect the tax when that income had not actually been received. That was introduced in relation to the current year of income at a cost of some $180 million. It was an element of fairness for small businesses, self-funded retirees and other people who pay provisional tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government did not change the formula to reduce the provisional uplift factor to six per cent just as a one&hyphen;off. This government changed it forever. This government put into legislation a proposal that would prevent the continuation of unrealistic provisional uplift factors by putting a formula into the legislation which applies to GDP growth in nominal terms over the course of a preceding year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the results of the GDP for the December 1996 quarter, the application of the formula produces a provisional tax uplift factor for next year of 5.95 per cent, rounded again to six per cent. That will be the provisional tax uplift factor in relation to the next year of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Harnessing the provisional tax uplift factor to the growth in nominal GDP is fair for taxpayers, but it was not always the case that it was done. Back in 1990-91 the then Labor government had a provisional tax uplift factor of 10 per cent in a year in which incomes subject to provisional tax fell by 4.1 per cent. When incomes went backwards, the Australian Labor Party government assessed people on the basis of a 10 per cent rise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1991-92 the Australian Labor Party applied a 10 per cent provisional uplift factor when incomes fell by three per cent. In 1992-93 the Australian Labor Party applied a provisional tax uplift factor of eight per cent when incomes subject to provisional tax rose by one per cent. With figures like that, it is no wonder that small business is saying this is the first government that ever gave them

Let us understand what this shadow minister has been about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This shadow minister has been about scaring old people ever since she arrived here. She has not been about trying to promote decent policy. She has not been about trying to improve the lot of older people in the Australian community. She has been about trying to scare them. You know that. Her leader knows that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me return to the substance of the question, about some kind of attack on the policy announced in the last budget by my colleague in relation to residential aged care arrangements.

I have a copy of a release here which I am happy to table. Formally, that request will be considered on 20 March in Geneva. I want to say that, as the Deputy Prime Minister said last week, Australia will vigorously defend its position. AQIS has undertaken an exhaustive and complex risk assessment based on internationally accepted principles. It has used comprehensive scientific analysis, resulting in this exhaustive docu
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2210"> ment which members might be interested in perusing at their leisure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AQIS decided that entry of uncooked salmon presented a degree of scientific complexity with attendant risks substantially greater than many other access requests. They found at least 20 diseases of concern, and they established the likelihood that some diseases would be present in imported product; that there were significant gaps in knowledge of diseases, including carrier status and infective doses; and that there were multiple pathways by which exotic agents could enter our waterways. Furthermore, AQIS established that if something did get here, eradication would be virtually impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It needs to be remembered that Canadian cooked salmon imports continue to be allowed and that they are currently running at some $25 million worth of imports per year. This has not created any quarantine problem, and there has been no change to those arrangements. Quarantine is a critically important matter for all Australians, as I am sure all members of this House will acknowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the Uruguay Round negotiations, the former government&mdash;with our support and that of farm organisations&mdash;signed onto an agreement which, for the first time, brought agricultural trade under international disciplines and began the process of winding back damaging production and export subsidies as well as beginning to open up previously closed markets. We also signed onto agreements relating to non-tariff barriers to trade, including quarantine measures. This again is important for Australia as a major net food exporter in stopping unfair trading practices. The stakes are actually very high. If countries are found to be imposing restrictions which are not scientifically and technically justified, then they would have to reverse such measures or make other compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for that reason that Australia has undertaken such an exhaustive and comprehensive study on the salmon request. We have acted entirely properly in formulating this decision. Australia's action remains totally consistent with our trade rights and obliga

But the Commonwealth does not have precise figures on legal aid funding for immigration as legal aid commissions do not collect data according to citizenship, and not all of the data collected by the commissions is available to the Commonwealth. State and territory legal aid commissions are currently independent of the Commonwealth and are independent of the state and territory governments as well. They currently establish their own guidelines for funding of legal aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Citizenship is not a criterion in legal aid commission guidelines for assessing eligibility for legal aid. However, the question from the honourable member for Fisher&mdash;and I know he has a particular interest in the subject&mdash;highlights some matters of considerable concern to the government in ensuring that legal aid dollars are appropriately spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spent some time talking about 70 per cent of referral funding that is allocated by legal aid commissions to 20 per cent of the cases. In one matter that has been drawn to my attention, a representative class action was brought by a group of boat arrivals. While they were in detention, there was an application to the Federal Court which was dismissed, an appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court which was dismissed and an application for special leave to appear before the High Court which was dismissed. The Commonwealth incurred legal costs of over $350,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there are legal aid costs on top of that. My colleague the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs revealed last year that the Commonwealth incurred an estimated $2 million of the costs of the detention of the applicants pending the conclusion of the proceedings. All of those
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> costs&mdash;legal aid costs, Commonwealth costs and detention costs&mdash;were ultimately borne by the Australian taxpayer. I am advised that this is just one of a number of cases where legally funded applications have been pursued unsuccessfully through every available channel. Such cases must be of as much concern to the Australian public as they are to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has announced that from 1 July 1997 Commonwealth funds for legal aid will be applied to matters arising under Commonwealth law which include immigration matters. The Commonwealth will clearly articulate its priorities for legal aid funding when the new legal aid arrangements are implemented. I can assure the honourable member for Fisher that in the setting of these priorities full account will be taken of the concerns he has expressed.</PARA>

Does he recall his other promises to maintain pensioner entitlements, not to increase taxes, not to increase child&hyphen;care charges and not to increase nursing home fees? Having broken each of these promises in his first budget, does he deny that the secret document confirms that he is now planning to break each one of them a second time?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly recall that during the election campaign I looked the families of Australia in the eye and said, `You'll have a family tax initiative worth $1 billion', and they got it. I looked the small business community in the eye and I said, `You will have capital gains tax relief', and they will get it almost in double measure on 1 July. I looked the self&hyphen;funded retirees of Australia in the eye and said, `We will give you the same tax rebate as other people have got at the same age', and they got that. I looked the Australian public in the eye and said we were not going to touch the Medicare system, and we have not touched the Medicare system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We looked a lot of groups in the Australian community in the eye and we have delivered on those commitments. I know that it galls the Leader of the Opposition and I know that it galls all of those people who sit on the front bench, but the fact is that the judgment of the Australian people after 12 months of this government is that we have stayed true and kept faith with the commitments that we made to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud when I go round this country, when I talk to the families of Australia, when I talk to the small business men and women of this country, when I talk to self&hyphen;funded retirees and to many other sections of the Australian community, and they believe that they have a government whose word can be trusted, unlike the government they so unceremoniously threw out. When it comes to the credibility of the two sides of politics in Australia, nothing can compare with that chilling judgment of Gary Gray when he was talking about preparation for the last election campaign. He said, `When the public thought that we stank&mdash;which we did&mdash;when they didn't believe us any more, when we couldn't make any credible commitments any more, the only thing we really had to run on was Paul's leadership.' That was the admission of an honest man, but it was also a counsel of political despair. It was the admission of an honest man, of Gary Gray, saying that the Australian public did not believe the Keating government. Of course they did not believe the Keating government;

<ANSWER PAGE="2212" SPEAKER="Smith, Warwick, MP" NAMEID="GJ4" ELECTORATE="Bass" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Sport, Territories and Local Government; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I am aware of the fact that Saturday is International Women's Day. Indeed, the Prime Minister elaborated on it extensively earlier in question time. It is also important to note that the 2000 Olympic Games will be the  centennial of the involvement of women in the Olympics. Despite there being far fewer numbers at Olympic Games, including Atlanta, female athletes have won a disproportionately high number of all medals won by Australians at the Olympics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In certain Olympic sports, particularly swimming and track and field, Australian women have been outstanding. For example, since 1948 and including Atlanta, Australian women have constituted just over 30 per cent of the track and field team but have won 75 per cent of all the medals and 11 out of the 14 gold medals&mdash;which is a pretty good record. In swimming, women have won 15 of the 25 gold medals won by Australians since 1912.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that the 2000 Olympics in Sydney will mark the centennial involvement of women in the games. The federal government has entered already into a joint arrangement with the New South Wales government to support a program to celebrate this centenary. The program will include training seminars, the production of resource material aimed at schools focusing on girls and physic
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2213"> al activity, and the recognition of the achievements of Australian sportswomen between the years 1900 and 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Liaison with SOCOG, the Sydney organising committee, and the International Olympic Committee to conduct a gala function during the 2000 games honouring past Olympic medal&hyphen;winning females will be conducted. Working with local government, another area of my portfolio, will also be a priority as we develop policies to assist and promote the involvement of women in local sport programs. The implementation of this program will, I trust, represent a suitable acknowledgment of the tremendous contribution female athletes, and particularly Australian women, have made during the last century to the Olympic Games in sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is probably worth mentioning to the House some of the outstanding achievements that have just taken place by sportswomen from Australia. Only a couple of months ago, Kirsty Marshall was the first Australian to ever win an aerial freestyle skiing world championship. Emma George, who would be well&hyphen;known to many of you, has bettered the women's pole vaulting record by some 30 centimetres&mdash;an outstanding achievement. Cara Honeychurch is now the tenpin bowling champion of the world. Karrie Webb, as we know, has elevated women's involvement in world golf to new heights.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I refer the minister to the government's health policy for the veteran community in rural and remote areas launched last October. What benefits has the policy delivered to the veteran community, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander veterans and, most particularly, Australian South Sea Islanders?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Dawson for her question. She has a very strong and keen interest in not only the people of rural and regional Australia but also our veteran community. She mentioned the South Sea Islanders. I know she has one of the largest&mdash;if not the largest&mdash;number of South Sea Islanders in the electorate of Dawson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In acknowledgment of the fact that 30 per cent of our veteran community live outside metropolitan Australia, last October the government introduced its rural and remote health policy for the veteran community. The problem is that it was 13 years too late. They had 13 years to deliver to the veteran community but they did not do anything or acknowledge the fact that they even existed out in regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to highlight a couple of initiatives and bring to the notice of the House how those trials and how those initiatives are impacting on our veteran community. The rural medication trial, for instance, targeted veterans who had particularly high incidence and usage of medications. At least 97 per cent of those veterans trialled in that process had some problem with their medication. We were able to fix some of those problems. For instance, one veteran who was taking up to 15 medications is now down to five medications. That has meant, and is related to, a much better health outcome for that veteran community. We now have established a link with the Royal Flying Doctor Service of this country, which is able to put in place annual 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> health care programs for our veterans who live in rural and remote Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. The member for Leichhardt has a particular interest in the welfare of Torres Strait Islanders. He is the first federal member to establish an office on Thursday Island because of his particular interest in Thursday Island and the Torres Strait Islanders. Since he has been there, and following my visit there, we have been able to initiate through the Queensland health department permanent podiatry clinics for those entitled veterans in the Torres Strait islands. Given that there is a very high incidence of diabetes in Torres Strait Islanders, this service will be particularly beneficial for those who live on those Torres Strait islands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The veteran community of this nation gave unselfishly to this nation. Their service is our heritage. We should never forget that. We have not forgotten those who live outside metropolitan Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the honourable member for Moore asked me a question on the double orphan pension. I said I would refer the matters to the Minister for Social Security. In this matter the answer the minister has provided is: yes, the current rate is $37.50 for a double orphan pension and it is judged to be adequate. It is intended to address any additional financial strain of caring for an orphan child. The needs of different groups are also addressed through the existing system of family assistance aside from the double orphan pension. The vast majority of persons receiving double orphan pensions also receive family payment, which aims to provide help with ongoing costs of raising children. Pensioners with dependent children receive family payment at the maximum rate, which is $124.90 a fortnight for each child aged 13 to 15 years and $96 a fortnight for each child under 13 years.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other supplements and assistance are available according to carers' circumstances, such as the guardian allowance for sole parents. The government is also providing additional assistance to families through the family tax initiative. Some state and territory governments also provide supplementary financial assistance for carers of orphans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to get further information about the family tax initiative, it can be obtained from `You and your family'. It demonstrates there the additional benefits are quite substantial, around $7.70 a fortnight for a single child and $19.20 for a family who are eligible for parts A and B, which I suspect in most cases they will be.</PARA></QUESTION></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Honourable members will recall the sadness and dismay with which the nation heard the news of the accident at the high range training area near Townsville shortly after dusk on 12 June 1996. The accident occurred during an exercise to practise the recovery of Australian citizens held hostage by armed terrorists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Six Black Hawk helicopters and 24 aircrew from the 5th Aviation Regiment and 43 soldiers of the Special Air Service were conducting a live&hyphen;fire airmobile assault on a simulated terrorist position. As the formation reached the target zone, two helicopters collided. The lead helicopter crashed to the ground upside down and was consumed by fire. The second helicopter entered a flat spin before crash landing in an upright position. It too was destroyed by fire. Eighteen Australian servicemen perished and a further 12 were injured&mdash;some critically. Equipment worth $37 million was destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were heroic acts in the face of this terrible accident. The reaction at the crash scene was cool headed, courageous and swift. Despite the confusion of the collision and the crash and the danger of flames and exploding ammunition, those at the scene acted quickly and decisively to evacuate the injured. I am advised that the Army will be proposing a number of awards to recognise brave and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2218"> conspicuous service in the immediate aftermath of the accident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The professional response of local ADF units, the Queensland Emergency Service, the Queensland Police and the staff at Townsville General Hospital undoubtedly saved further lives.

This was done as quickly as was possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know from letters which have been sent to me that the sensitive assistance of family support bodies and the overwhelming support of the Australian community were of great comfort to the families of the victims, to their comrades and to those close to them.</PARA>

This is particularly true with just three years remaining before the Sydney Olympic Games. Training for counter&hyphen;terrorism operations is inherently dangerous. It takes our forces to the cutting edge of capability. It demands degrees of speed, stealth, precision, accuracy and lethality beyond those required of any other element of the Army.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But such training also demands a careful balance between safety and realism. This can only be achieved through meticulous military preparation and planning and the execution of a staged progression of training which reflects the difficulty and danger of the task to be achieved. This need to balance safety and realism is at the heart of the report which I will table today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the accident the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General John Sanderson, appointed a military board of inquiry. The board was required to establish the primary and contributory causes of the accident and to make recommendations to prevent another tragedy. While it was also to make recommendations in relation to possible disciplinary action, the board was not constituted as a court and had no powers or authority to make findings in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relation to offences under the Defence Force Discipline Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the exception of matters concerning national security, the inquiry was open to the public. The survivors and the next of kin and families of those who lost their lives were provided Commonwealth funding to attend the hearings and received legal representation as required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The board of inquiry was extensive and thorough. It conducted hearings in Perth, Townsville and Sydney over a period of three months. It took evidence from 144 witnesses, accepted 215 written exhibits and considered numerous instructions, correspondence and statements. The board's report, which was submitted to the Chief of Army on 20 December last year, reflects this thoroughness. It comprises more than 7,000 pages in 17 volumes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since submission to the Chief of Army, the board's finding and recommendations have been studied in detail by technical and legal experts within the Army and the Department of Defence. These experts have confirmed the adequacy of the board's report and advised on corrective action to minimise the probability of further accidents. These recommendations form the basis of the Chief of Army's report which was submitted to me last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his report, General Sanderson addresses the findings of the board of inquiry, the advice of the panel of experts and, most importantly, the steps to be taken to reduce the risk of further accidents. The board found that the immediate cause of the accident was that the lead helicopter, Black 1, turned right and converged on an adjacent helicopter, Black 2. As a result, Black 1 struck Black 2 with multiple rotor blade strikes, causing both aircraft to crash and be destroyed by fire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as is almost always the case with accidents of this nature, the events immediately preceding the accident do not stand in isolation. The board found that, while there was no single reason for the tragedy, there was a chain of events that successively and cumulatively led to a situation where the accident became what the board describes as the inevitable outcome.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2219">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the early stages of the board's proceedings, there was a good deal of speculation about the causes of the crash. At that time and until today, the government took the position that it would not comment on matters before the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The findings of the board clearly dismiss some of the more widely speculated causes. It found:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There were no mechanical defects in the Black Hawk helicopters involved. In fact, the aircraft's design unquestionably prevented a greater death toll.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The accident was not caused by unserviceable night vision goggles.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> No shots were fired in or at any aircraft which were causal to the accident, nor was there any ordnance explosion prior to the collision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The board identified 16 directly causative and a further 26 contributing factors. It found a linkage between these factors, although it did not place a separate weighting on each of them. The board found a number of long&hyphen;term systemic factors which contributed to the accident. Among them:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Black Hawk aircraft had a high rate of unserviceability in the two years leading up to the accident.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> High pilot separation rates over a similar period had further eroded the bank of experience and skill at the 5th Aviation Regiment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These factors clearly affected the experience levels among Black Hawk crews and prevented them from gaining sufficient flying experience for special counter&hyphen;terrorism operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More immediate factors arose from the planning, preparation, rehearsal and conduct of the exercise. Among these:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The planning for the air mission on the night of the accident was found by the board to be inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There was inadequate information about the objective.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There was a failure on the part of aircrew adequately to resolve conflicting understanding of the location of specific targets.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The conduct of the night mission differed from that of the day mission and there was no rehearsal of those changes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The flight lead in Black 1 lacked experience in leading special recovery missions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On their own, none of these factors directly caused the accident. But the board found that as a train of events they, in addition to other causes, cumulatively contributed to a situation where the accident became inevitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The function of the board was not merely to determine the cause of the crash but also to identify areas for remedial action to reduce the risk of further accidents. This aspect is of the very greatest importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The board made 79 recommendations, many of which require the Australian Defence Force to implement and adhere to best practice procedures. These recommendations will help ensure a safer environment and assist in preventing a recurrence of the circumstances which led to this accident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of the accident, I made clear our determination that all possible measures were to be taken to ameliorate risk without compromising capability. Accordingly, the Chief of Army has developed a plan to implement the board's recommendations. The plan addresses systemic and equipment issues and proposes measures to improve command, control and exercise planning as well as changes to training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To stem separation rates, the Army is reviewing the employment and conditions of service of its aircrew. Measures so far taken include the introduction of a pilot retention bonus, increasing return of service obligations and increasing the numbers of trainee army pilots. In addition, the Army is ensuring that qualified flying instructors can be better employed in operational units by contracting out some of the less demanding pilot instruction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Action has been taken to place all counter&hyphen;terrorism and special recovery elements within the same command structure, with all outcomes now being the responsibility of the Land Commander. The Army is reviewing the training requirements for counter&hyphen;terrorism and special recovery operations. This will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2220"> establish a training sequence to overcome the erosion of combined skills which had previously occurred between biennial special recovery exercises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New directives will be issued to ensure that the command and control, planning, intelligence gathering, orders and briefings, conduct of missions and training requirements which were recommended by the board are specified for future special forces operations. The acquisition of proximity warning devices, improved night vision goggles and redesigned fast roping and rappelling devices is being evaluated. Crash data recorders will be fitted to all Army aircraft as a matter of priority and to Black Hawk helicopters as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have directed the Chief of Army, as the responsible commander, to provide me with monthly reports on the progress of the implementation plan and on the status and safety of counter&hyphen;terrorism training. In addition, I have asked the Chief of the Defence Force, General John Baker, to establish an overarching Defence Force Flying Safety Authority, under the Chief of Air Force. This authority will be responsible for the supervision of all flying safety issues for the Defence Force, regardless of the service operating individual types of aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the issue of whether disciplinary action is to be taken against any individual. In accordance with its terms of reference, the board recommended that disciplinary action be considered against five members in relation to negligence, deficiencies in the exercise of command and errors of judgment. The Chief of Army has considered these recommendations and has taken advice from the Army's legal branch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of advice to him, the Chief of Army has referred the board's report and the legal advice to the Land Commander Australia, whom he has appointed as a convening authority, to consider whether or not to prefer charges under the Defence Force Discipline Act against three persons. In addition, the Chief of Army has decided to take administrative action against two other personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until the matters of military discipline are properly determined by the convening authori 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ty, it would be quite inappropriate to disclose the names or appointments of any persons facing administrative action or referred to the convening authority, or to disclose details of offences which might be pursued against individuals. For this reason, some of the findings and recommendations which could lead to possible disciplinary action have been expunged from the report, which I will table today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the responsibility of the convening authority to decide whether military charges are to be laid. I expect the Chief of Army to announce the decision of the convening authority within a month. I can inform the House, however, that, as a result of requests for advice by the department, separate advice has been received from the Queensland and Commonwealth Directors of Public Prosecutions that, based on the board's report, no criminal charges would arise from the accident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some time, the government has been considering the issue of the adequacy of the compensation and rehabilitation benefits available to members of the ADF. Military service is distinctly different from civilian employment. It often involves considerably more dangerous activities which may result in severe injury or death. It, therefore, warrants distinct rehabilitation and compensation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for a review of military compensation was brought into sharper focus by the Black Hawk accident. In particular, it has become quite clear that parts of the existing peacetime compensation and rehabilitation scheme for ADF personnel are inappropriate. Consequently, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) ordered a review of existing rehabilitation and compensation arrangements for military personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review was to investigate compensation arrangements for military personnel including the adequacy of the lump sum payments, ancillary benefits and supporting services for dependants of deceased personnel. It was to also examine the different entitlements that accrue to members of the ADF for death or severe injury suffered during peacetime 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2221"> service under the Veterans' Entitlements Act or the military compensation scheme as well as the administrative arrangements involved when members are covered by both schemes. This review is to report to Mrs Bishop very shortly and will be subject to consideration by cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing we can do will fully compensate for the loss of those 18 Australian servicemen. All of us have been profoundly affected by this tragedy, but I hope that some consolation can be found in the knowledge that those who perished did so in the service of their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Defence Force has set in train sound, logical and decisive steps to ensure that counter&hyphen;terrorism and special recovery operations can be conducted for the protection of all Australians. The training and preparation of our counter&hyphen;terrorism forces will continue to be as demanding and realistic as is safely possible. We must maintain our cutting edge capability in counter&hyphen;terrorism operations. Those lost in this terrible accident would have expected nothing less of us. I present the following papers:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The 12th of June 1996 was a day of tragedy and grief for many. It was certainly a day of tragedy and grief for the Army, for the 5th Aviation Regiment, for the SAS, for the country, who properly recognised in mourning the events of that day, but most particularly for the family and the comrades of the 18 who died and those who survived.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very difficult circumstance for all involved and, I must say, having been in Townsville the day prior to the accident visiting the Army base in Townsville and then remaining for the subsequent services, it was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a traumatic experience for all involved. I again take this opportunity to extend my thanks to the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) and those in the Army who extended to me their courtesies on that occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is properly a matter that is presented to the parliament for us to consider. It is, as the minister said, the most tragic circumstance in peacetime since the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Melbourne</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> tragedy, and I am pleased that the Chief of Army and other senior officers are able to be here for this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report identifies what I think many of us suspected: there was no one incident that would have produced such a terrible tragedy. The report has been conducted in an open way, and I commend Army for the way in which they have addressed what has been a traumatic experience for them and those involved. The inquiry has been conducted largely in public view and it is appropriate that a report of this type be made available to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It identifies some 16 causal factors that directly impacted on the accident and another 26 factors that contributed to it. There is quite an extensive list of other failings that it identified but which it considered played no role in this particular incident, although I would hope and assume that those errors, having been identified, will be pursued with the same vigour as those other failings which, on this occasion, did contribute to the tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has mentioned that, quite properly, a number of recommendations have been implemented or set in train during the inquiry and prior to this time and that there is a time line for the implementation of all recommendations. I would seek from the minister at the earliest opportunity, at an appropriate time, the details of those recommendations which have already been implemented and the details of the time frame for the implementation of all recommendations. In the circumstances I do believe it is appropriate that the monthly report that the minister indicated he would be receiving from the Chief of Army is also made available to the opposition so that we can, on a bipartisan 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2222"> basis, be confident that the circumstances that led to this tragedy are put to rest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note also the comments the minister made in relation to the review of compensation. That is an important issue. The review, I understood, was to have a completion date of 1 March. I appreciate that that may have altered, but we would seek some details from the government in relation to the time lines on that review. It is an important matter which has raised a good deal of concern by those involved and, I might add, by a number of people in the community who, whilst not directly involved, felt a great deal of compassion and concern for the victims of that tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn to a couple of the matters that are contained in the report, because I think it is important to address in the parliament some of the issues which led to the tragedy and hopefully get some advice in due course as to their remedy. Not surprisingly, the report identifies the high pilot separation rates as one of the factors that was at play in the circumstances leading up to the June accident, and the minister made mention of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would make the comment that, whilst the government has taken some initiatives in respect of retention bonuses, I do not think that retention bonuses are anything more than, at best, a bandaid&mdash;and that is probably the kindest interpretation. There is a need to address the underlying difficulties of the pilot separation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also notes that there was inadequate and untimely joint exercise planning between the SASR and 5 Aviation Regiment. I would think that that matter has been addressed very quickly in the short term and may be one of those issues to which the minister alluded, but again I would seek some advice on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It came as something of a surprise in the course of the inquiry, given that it was conducted largely in an open manner, to read the evidence that referred to incomplete and uncoordinated reconnaissance of the exercise site. These are matters that you anticipate are put in place as routine and clearly on this occasion were not. Equally, the inaccurate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> diagrammatic presentation of the hill on which the assault was to occur is one of those errors that I find hard to understand could have occurred and changing the flight profile and the direction for the night mission from that which was used during the day practice seemed to me to be striking examples of failings that do require some closer examination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice also that the report identifies that the scope and complexity of the mission that was undertaken exceeded the standard operating procedures laid down for the 5th Aviation Regiment, and no doubt the minister would be pursuing that issue. It is an issue which I think both sides of the parliament have a legitimate interest in. It is a fairly significant point made in the report and should be the subject of some further communications with the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the comment the minister made about the night vision goggles, which seemed to excite the passions of a lot of journalists. I note the comments in the review that there was no failing in respect of that equipment, although it did make some comments about the limitations that it may place on operational activities and some compensating measures that need to be put in place. Again I assume that is one of those areas in which action has already been taken, but I would seek the minister's response to that at an appropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a range of matters contained in the actual report which do give rise to a whole series of questions that it is my intention to pursue, but I do not think today is the occasion on which those matters should be pursued. But I do seek from the minister the opportunity to raise them in possibly a more appropriate forum. It is incumbent on us, above all, to do two things arising from this. This is a matter that all of the parliament no doubt will adhere to. We have an obligation to ensure that the errors that led to this tragedy are corrected and that no other personnel in future are placed in the same circumstances with the same series of events that led to this tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a second and at least equal responsibility to ensure that the victims of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2223"> accident&mdash;those who survived and the loved ones and comrades of those who are deceased&mdash;are properly cared for. I understand the difficulties that governments confront in addressing some of those issues. No doubt the review that Minister Bishop is receiving addresses those complexities. I can simply say that any effort that the government is inclined to look at in respect of that will be given very reasonable consideration by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy in June of last year is something that impacted significantly on those in Townsville as well as those in Perth. The fact that a good deal of support has been provided to them is supported by us and I know is expected by the community. In addressing those two overriding principles that I have mentioned, the government will have the opposition's clear and strong support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finish my comments, though, by recognising the point that has been made by the minister, and I know by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and me, that to defend Australia and to defend against the sorts of contingencies that we realistically have to confront in this world of ours it is necessary to have people in uniform who undertake training in the most realistic of circumstances that are, of necessity, dangerous. It is not an option for the defence of Australia to relinquish that responsibility and to move back from the need for that training. Equally, it is our responsibility as legislators to ensure that the equipment, the training and the support provided by the nation to those people who put their lives on the line is of the first order, and I trust that that is an ambition and a goal shared by us all.</PARA>

The decision we saw the government announce this week is bad policy&mdash;it is bad for jobs, it is bad for trade, it is bad for exports, it is bad for New South Wales, it is bad for Queensland. The minister at the table, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), one of the culprits, and the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) have gone belly up to the Sydney lawyer, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Melbourne lawyer, the Treasurer, Mr Costello. They have gone belly up to the Melbourne and Sydney economic rationalists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one member on the other side of the House who represents a sugar industry electorate who is prepared to stand up for the sugar industry and that is the member for Kennedy, Mr Katter. As for the rest of the members who represent sugar seats it is not the case of `S' stands for sugar, `S' stands for surrender or `S' stands for silence. They deserve to be named.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go through them. They include: the member for Richmond, Mr Anthony, from the National Party; the member for Page, Mr Causley, from the National Party; the member for Dawson, Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly, from the National Party; and the member for Hinkler, Mr Neville, from the National Party. The member for Kennedy, Mr Katter, from the National Party is the only one to stand up for the sugar industry. The rest are silent or have surrendered. Their Liberal colleagues, their partners in crime, include: the member for Leichhardt, Mr Entsch, and the member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what they have been saying individually. The member for Rich 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2224"> mond, Mr Anthony, got up on the adjournment a couple of weeks ago and said, `I am from New South Wales. We are not going to get steamrolled here. We want adequate compensation and we are going to go hell for leather to get it.' Now he is saying, `This is a sensational result for New South Wales&mdash;$2 million compensation.' The cost to New South Wales is $8 million! The day after the decision, Mr Anthony was up saying, `The decision was a good compromise.' Today he is saying, `This is a great result. It is going to be a lot better for New South Wales and if it is anyone's fault then people should look to the Queensland industry.' He is wiping his hands and saying it is better for New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Richmond, Mr Anthony, should understand a piece of history. When his family had an opportunity to support Black Jack McEwen in his first bid to become Deputy Leader of the National Party, his grandfather voted against him in the National Party caucus. The first opportunity that the member for Richmond has to support the National Party members and supporters in New South Wales he does exactly the same&mdash;he turns his back on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the member for Page, Mr Causley, do? All he does is ask the Prime Minister dorothy dix questions so that the Prime Minister can stand up and gut the sugar industry. What do we find from the member for Dawson, Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly? She talks tough, but she does nothing. She is no Ray Braithwaite. She is not like Ray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as those North Queensland members are concerned, this is a double whammy for North Queensland. What did we see them all do this morning? They voted for the reef tax. What did we see them do today? They gut the sugar industry in Queensland. This is a double whammy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we find so far as the member for Hinkler is concerned? We find him talking quietly to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier Mail</EMPHASIS> about compromise, a bit of qualm and a bit of concern. What will we find him doing eventually? Exactly what he did on the reef tax&mdash;nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Leichhardt has been so silent on this issue until today that I though 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he had his crocodile boots in his mouth. We hear a lot from the member for Leichhardt, Mr Entsch, about crocodile boots, but he was silent on this issue until today. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> today he said that he supported the scrapping of the sugar tariff after initial misgivings because the move was backed by the sugar industry. This is the line that we get from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Prime Minister. We will dispose of that very shortly. The member for Herbert has been absolutely silent. I see the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) is in the chamber. He does not directly represent a sugar seat but we may as well ping him for the reef tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Trade, Mr Fischer, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy have rolled over to the views of the Prime Minister and Treasurer on this. I woke up yesterday morning to the dulcet tones of the Minister for Trade, before he jumped on the plane for another overseas mission, waxing lyrical about how much he enjoys coming to Canberra these days. He said that he did not when he first came but he does now. He said how much he enjoys sitting down with Kate Carnell and having a chat about the important policy decisions made in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No wonder Hendy Cowan says he is ratting on rural and regional Australia. No wonder Hendy Cowan came out last week saying that people like the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Trade were not listening, that they had lost touch, that they were not supporting industries in rural and regional Australia, that they have lost direction and that they are doing nothing for industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have look at the facts on the sugar industry. Our Uruguay Round obligation is $70 per tonne by the year 2000. We comfortably meet that already with $55 per tonne, effective to 1 July, and $37 per tonne if it comes from a developing country. That comes in at about a 13 per cent tariff. The next WTO agricultural round starts in 1999. In the trade outcomes statement that the Minister for Trade tabled in February we find as a key priority, where trading partner tariff and non-tariff barriers need to be broken down, sugar 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2225"> export barriers in China, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the United States, which make up over 50 per cent of our sugar exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some of these countries and others, you find that the sugar tariff rate is 100 per cent as is the case in the United States, 104 per cent as in the case of Thailand or 170 to 193 per cent in the European Union, depending on how you do your calculation. We are at 13 per cent, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Trade say, `Let's go to zero and get nothing in return.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the countries which is mentioned in the trade outlook statement as requiring a special effort from us to break down a tariff or a non-tariff barrier is Thailand, with a sugar tariff barrier of 104 per cent. The Thai ministers were here last week. They had cups of tea and biscuits with the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). We had the press releases, the communiques and the dorothy dixers in the House. Did we hear anything about the sugar barriers? No. Not a murmur. Not a word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what does the Prime Minister do on Tuesday of this week? He stands up and says, `We'll drop the sugar tariff to zero without any reference to what our trading partners are doing. We'll give you something for nothing. We'll put all our cards on the table and get nothing in return. We'll allow the cane growers from Clarence to Cairns to dance naked in the paddocks while we drop our sugar tariff to zero.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister also said in question time that the price has been good. Is the Prime Minister into price fixing now? He also said to the Leader of the Opposition and us on this side, `You're being opportunistic about this. You come at this with dirty hands.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let no-one in this House misunderstand the position and the history of this matter. The Labor Party comes to the sugar industry and the sugar tariff debate with very clean hands. It was our decision to halt tariff cuts. In February 1993 a newspaper headline said `Labor halts tariff cuts on sugar'. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's sugar plan leaves the $55 a tonne tariff for a minimum of three seasons beyond the coming season, with a review beginning in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What did the then opposition, the now government, say? According to the article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition last night signalled that it would announce concessions for the industry, but reaffirmed its commitment to negligible protection by 2000.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what they wanted then, and that is what they are going for now. And don't think we didn't get bagged for doing it. Don't think we didn't get bagged for saying to Queensland and New South Wales sugar farmers, `We believe in a phased down tariff so far as your industry is concerned.' What about the friends of the economic rationalists on the other side&mdash;the friends of the Melbourne and Sydney lawyers who have rolled the minister for primary industries and the Minister for Trade? Another headline stated `IC condemns sugar tariff freeze as a wrong signal'. So we were bagged for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But at about the same time&mdash;April 1992&mdash;an article appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">North Queensland Register</EMPHASIS>. There was a photograph of the now Prime Minister with the caption `John Howard thinks hard before answering a question put to him on the sugar tariff issue'. The article referred to the now Prime Minister as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He acknowledged cane farmers were suffering the effects of poor seasonal  conditions and low world prices.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister now stands at the dispatch box and says, `The price has been good; ignore the tariff,' pretending to the sugar industry in New South Wales and Queensland and to members of this House that you can rely absolutely on commodity prices when three or four years ago, when he was speaking to them with a worried look on his face, he said, `I accept there are seasonal and price variations.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Prime Minister has been massively hypocritical on this point. Last year in the House, when making a statement on the APEC and WTO meetings, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has already reduced tariffs and other barriers more than most member economies. Like every other government, mine will take account of what other economies are doing in deciding future steps.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  the headline `PM to Asia: We won't got it alone on tariff cuts'. We won't go it alone. What do we find the Prime Minister is now doing on sugar? He is doing precisely that&mdash;going alone. The tariff is going from 13 per cent to zero when our trading partners have tariffs as high as 100 per cent in the case of the United States, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2227"> 104 per cent in the case of Thailand and 170 per cent in the case of the European Union. We have put the tariff on the table and got nothing in return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On our side, we believe in a viable exporting sugar industry. We believe in making sure that our tariff is linked to the obligations of other trading countries, and we bear their efforts in mind when we look at ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our plan was to freeze tariffs to 1 July this year and review it. We have done our review. Our review says: keep it where it is and look at the tariff in the context of what our trading partners do and in the context of the next WTO round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision is bad for the sugar industry. It is bad for jobs in New South Wales. It is bad for northern Queensland. It is bad trade policy. It is bad for exports.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the previous speaker in this place is exposed for his absolute and cheap, almost breathtaking, hypocrisy on this matter. This is not just about tariffs. This is not just about the latest of their bellyflops.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just had a look through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> at all the hairy&hyphen;chested things that some of their previous ministers have said about tariffs in recent times. The most recent example I could find was from the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) in November last year, just before the House rose at Christmas time. This was just before the Labor Party decided, `We are going to desert all principle. We will not only walk away from the battlers'&mdash;which they did a long time ago, and it has been recognised&mdash;`but we will walk away from principle as well.' They decided that over Christmas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As late as November last year, the member for Hotham, who was one&hyphen;time minister for primary industries and minister for industry&mdash;all those sorts of things&mdash;was claiming to be concerned about jobs and was saying that it was only the Labor Party that had ever got on with the job of tariff reform in Australia. Now they are walking away from that. What needs to be clearly understood is that, in this in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2228"> stance, the member for Perth&mdash;and I notice he will not confront me on it&mdash;is now plainly walking away from industry policy as well. I will talk about industry policy in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me come to the next point. It is perfectly obvious that either the member for Perth is a total hypocrite or he does not actually understand that tariffs are of no use to export industries.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ANTHONY" NAMEID="XJ6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ6">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is a bit of both.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Probably a bit of both. Let me repeat: if you, the member for Perth, aspire to be a trade minister, you ought to understand that tariffs are of no use to export industries. That is why farm leaders in Australia have for decades sought to eliminate them. So there you go. Every farm leader in Australia recognises that tariffs cost farmers money. They cost the export sector. They hold the export sector back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the early 1980s, it is estimated, the average farm in Australia saw its operating costs blown out by $11,000 or $12,000 a year because of high tariffs. For that reason, the Australian farm sector began to aggressively pursue lower tariffs so that they could reduce the inflated costs of operating an Australian farm. That is what has started to happen. We have got the average operating cost per farm down now to about $2,000 to $2,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sugar industry is one of the very few Australian industries that enjoys at times&mdash;not at the moment&mdash;a bit of marginal benefit from tariff protection. In this instance, it has to be acknowledged that, in the sugar industry, many growers would have preferred the tariff not to have gone. I will come back to that in moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come to the issue of leadership&mdash;something that those opposite plainly do not understand. Even though the member for Perth stood by the previous Prime Minister, the man who had his levers on everything&mdash;goodness only knows what levers he gave to this bloke!&mdash;it is perfectly obvious that he learnt nothing about leadership, because he hasn't got the backbone to take a stand on anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to assume, given that he had a position of some responsibility in terms of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> providing advice, that he must have something going for him in the grey matter stakes. He must understand something of these issues. He must have some policy sense. But, plainly, he is prepared to sacrifice any willingness to show any backbone on these issues, unlike, I have to say, primary industry leadership of the sort that has resulted in this outcome. I am going to quote from today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Country Life</EMPHASIS>, under the heading, `Cane tariff cut fitting example':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The belt tightening tariff cut brought down on the sugar industry by its own Sugar Industry Review must pose a challenge to many other Australian industries to follow suit and become more internationally competitive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It stands to reason that an overhaul of competition policy applied to motor vehicles, fuel, transport charges, government charges and other cost inputs will greatly assist the international competitiveness of key export industries like sugar and grain.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here we have something recognised by the chief rural paper in the major sugar producing state that the so-called alternative trade minister in this country cannot see. The major rural newspaper in the state that grows the most sugar recognises the point that Australian rural industries stand to gain from pursuit of hard policy. It goes on to acknowledge the difficult side of it, but it also says, in part, and this is worth recording:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly the best way is to encourage protected industries to develop their own working parties, just as the sugar industry did, to combine the pain and the benefits that will equip them better to perform on the world trade stage.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to give the government a pat on the back. It says that we need to be careful to make sure that there is no dumping on our markets, and then says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government already has shown a strong lead in this direction by blocking Hungarian agricultural and manufactured products.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And so it goes on. It then says this about the industry:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank goodness the industry had enough fire in its belly retain what has worked well, while at the same time baring its breast to the necessary surgery of tariff reduction.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is leadership from those most affected when you cannot get leadership from an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2229"> alternative senior minister in this place. I think the case at that level rests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming to the question of sugar industry leadership, today the Bundaberg paper&mdash;and I commend the editor and the people on that paper for strong, straight down the line reporting of the facts and presentation of reality, when I guess it would be easy for them in the current circumstances to do otherwise&mdash;ran a story entitled `Tariff move supported:  sugar boss wants other industries to follow suit'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Canegrowers chairman Harry Bonanno&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">if any member in this place knows anything about the sugar industry, and quite obviously the previous speaker does not, they would know that Harry Bonanno is a strong, effective and recognised leader of the sugar industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">yesterday supported the Federal Government's announcement that it would endorse the removal of the $55-a-tonne sugar import tariff on July 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Even though the removal of the tariff and a number of other outcomes from the (Sugar Industry Review) package will . . . impact on the finances of individual growers, we accept that the package is the only way the sugar industry can satisfy National Competition Policy guidelines while enhancing global competitiveness," Mr Bonanno said.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here we go again on this issue: Harry Bonanno and the sugar industry recognise that national competition policy in net terms benefits rural industry; the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Country Life</EMPHASIS>  can see it; and every major farm group in the country can see it. The previous government never stopped arguing that it was self-evidently the case when they were being advised by people like the member for Perth. But when they get into opposition and find that they might be better served by a bit of populism on this&mdash;regardless of the long-term impact on industries and the country&mdash;they resort to it like duck to a water because, in the end, they are a bunch of opportunists.</PARA>

There are over 6,500 growers in Queensland, some 550 in New South Wales and an emerging number now in Western Australia. We annually produce in excess of five million tonnes of raw sugar worth in excess of $2 billion. We are the largest exporter of raw sugar in the world, although not a significant exporter of refined sugar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does seem that there is a considerable scope here for value adding. The member for Perth is studiously avoiding me at the moment because he knows how utterly exposed and superficial his position is.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The current system works against that goal and the package of reforms, supported by industry, aims to redress the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to return to the national competition policy, because it was agreed to by all governments in April 1995. I think it is time the opposition came clean and announced that this is the latest area on which they are going to do a major policy backflip. To all intents and purposes, that is what they have now announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a review that was set up under national competition policy guidelines&mdash;that is what it was there for. It was put there because the previous government led the charge for a national competition policy and got all the states to sign up to it. In broad terms, the objectives of the review were to ensure that government business enterprises&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2230"> the professions and industries in agriculture that were supported by statutory marketing arrangements&mdash;would be reviewed for their competitiveness. The sugar industry saw that it would be in their interests to get a competition review going early, and that is what they did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They set up a competition review team that looked exhaustively at the industry. They resolved that, in order to be advance value adding domestically&mdash;which this fellow over here keeps saying is important&mdash;and to open up further markets for Australian sugar on the domestic market, we needed to ensure that domestic manufacturers and consumers had access to sugar at world export prices. But at the same time they acknowledged that much more value was extracted out of the single desk export arrangements that are effectively underpinned by Queensland legislation pertaining to the Queensland Sugar Corporation. So the review team made their recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The short&hyphen;term way of meeting the competition policy objectives of ensuring that the domestic market was no higher than world export parity was to remove the tariff. The easiest way to ensure that we maximised our marketing clout on international markets, which the review team made quite plain is where the major financial benefit to the sugar industry and to the nation is, was to leave in place the acquisition powers of the Queensland Sugar Corporation. That is what they recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The next point is that industry then asked the Queensland government to put this through cabinet in a prompt way. The Queensland government did just that; the Queensland coalition government fully supported the package. There is only one part of that package which in any way involves the Commonwealth, and that is the tariff. So the Queensland government, the task force and the industry asked us to progress that through in this place. We have done so. But we have done so&mdash;and I know the second speaker for the government will cover this widely&mdash;in a way which recognises that there is something of a disproportionate impact in potential terms 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on New South Wales. We are a government that is concerned with equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I tell you this in closing. What ought to be carefully considered by those opposite, who now want to play hypocritical and opportunistic politics, is what they did&mdash;or rather what they did not do&mdash;for other Australian rural industries when they removed tariffs and protection in a way that really impacted on industries like citrus. They are exposed for their willingness to resort to the cheapest of political opportunism. I sincerely hope that that is recognised across the Australian community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with a couple of matters that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) dealt with. The minister was quoting a statement that we should become world competitive. I was looking at the figures from other countries that are our competitors and have tariffs. There are a limited number of countries in the world which are sugar exporters. To become more competitive we really do have to deal with the other countries. The US has a 100 per cent tariff. Thailand has 104 per cent. The European Union has 170 per cent. We will end up destroying our local markets by allowing the world to heap sugar on us. And the minister is quoting from something saying that we have to become more world competitive. How do we become world competitive against the figures of those other countries that are well above us at the moment?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just remember what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said&mdash;and he is very good at rhetoric, our Prime Minister, isn't he? He said, `We will not go alone.' Well, we are going alone with sugar tariffs. Why are we not using this in the next round with the World Trade Organisation? If you know how to negotiate, you have a few aces to negotiate with. Why are we not going to use this to negotiate? We are not going to use this to negotiate; we are just going to give it away now, without any rhyme or reason. We should not be doing that; we should be using the present tariff position. And we are in front. The $55 a tonne puts us in front of the $70 tonne limit 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2231"> required for our commitment to the World Trade Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jobs and job security are the first thing that we should be worried about to ensure that we have industries and skills to develop our export industries. Without developing our export industries, getting our employment levels up and the ability to train and be smarter, Australia is going to lose its competitive edge&mdash;if it sticks to just digging it up, scything it down, burning it off and pushing it off the continent as fast as possible without any tariffs or intervention to encourage processing, value adding or allowing local growers to try for import substitution. We can be a lot smarter in achieving goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that is being quoted for the removal of the tariff in the middle of this year is the government saying that it wants to ensure that New South Wales growers gain access to export markets currently dominated by the Queensland growers. The requirement is single desk selling both for domestic and export sugar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that the big sugar processors are nervous about losing control of their domestic market. They would see their export market very quickly undermined, and this is why the Queensland growers have said they have not reacted more strongly to loss of the tariff. It certainly is not their choice, as is being floated about by the minister and others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is concerned what the scrapping of the tariff might mean in terms of world trade, and that we should not be too hasty about dropping the tariff; we should be using  it when we go to the next round of negotiations. We are really jumping the gun when we do this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I quoted earlier, other countries are certainly miles behind us in the level of protection that they give their sugar industry. I am sure the cordial companies will not mind when they get imported sugar. When the cheaper sugar runs into Australia, I am sure the cordial companies will not be bringing down the price of the soft drinks on the shelves for the consumers of Australia. It will be interesting to see what happens in relation to that price from a consumer point of view.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of a number of National Party members, the one who has been most the vocal is the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), who  seems extraordinarily worried about this proposal. I must confess that it is great concern that he is not here in the House because he does take up issues that he feels very strongly about. I would expect him to be here and possibly vote to support this motion today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He believes that farmers would lose out considerably. He said that cane growers were forced to agree to the tariff removal or be abandoned to the mercies of the international processors and traders.

It does not seem that she will help too many sugar growers in Dawson. She should remember the time when Flo Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen stood up for the farmers near Mackay.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never seen such hypocrisy from a party in all my life. At least we have the honesty to stick by what we believe in. No&hyphen;one really wanted to see the abolition of the tariff. When you look closely at the reason for it at present, take into consideration what the Industry Commission did and look very carefully at the workings of the tariff, you would have to come to the same conclusion that they came to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present the domestic price of sugar in Australia is below the world price. If you people over there can brainstorm and tell me how a tariff can help that, I would be very pleased to hear. It has absolutely no effect at all on the sugar industry at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister did say that from time to time a tariff has been beneficial to the sugar industry, but at present it is of no value. When an industry says, `It is going to cost X number of dollars,' and they are talking some millions of dollars&mdash;I notice all we had from the opposition were quotes from newspapers; if you read the newspapers all the time and selectively quote you will not get it too right&mdash;obviously they are putting the worst case scenario to try to argue their case. They looked at the $55 a tonne tariff and multiplied that by the crop and said, `This is what we are going to lose.' I say to the parliament that they are not going to lose that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my experience in the sugar industry, if I were a salesman and I was already selling my product below the world price, am I likely to deduct another $30 off it?

They do not have a deep sea port. The closest deep sea port is Brisbane. Obviously there is a need for some infrastructure in that area to make sure that the industry can compete with the Queensland industry. The Queensland industry is a big industry, there is no doubt about that. As the minister said, Australia has consistently been the biggest exporter of sugar in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales industry needed to compete and the government looked closely at that and said yes. The New South Wales industry also said, quite rightly, that if it was going to lose its share of the domestic market&mdash;the American quota of 160,000 tonnes, which is an Australian quota&mdash;they were entitled to five per cent of that quota because they grew five per cent of the cane in Australia. I think that is a perfectly reasonable assessment to make; they should get five per cent. That is worth $2 million.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">In November 1996 the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) tabled the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure on the topic of conduct of divisions. The report targeted the expedition of vote counting. Whereas now the government has a large majority, the majority report recommended that for ordinary divisions members should file past tellers when they enter the chamber and, while the bells were still ringing, record their vote and that, for consecutive divisions, members would need only report to the tellers if they intended to change their votes, abstain or if they had not voted in the preceding division.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2236">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minority report favoured the introduction of electronic voting for the House. In my response to the report, I indicated that, while not disputing the advantages of electronic voting, it appeared the costs of implementation were likely to be very high. I have since sought advice on the cost issue from the Speaker. In any event, I see this as a longer term issue. Accordingly, I have entered into discussions with the Labor opposition and the member for Moore (Mr Filing), on behalf of the Independents, with a view to trialling the non&hyphen;electronic recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the outset, the opposition expressed reservations about practical aspects of the committee's proposed procedures for ordinary or single divisions. They were, however, prepared to look at the alternative of two sets of tellers to undertake the count on the government side. In practice, that would mean there would be no change to the current procedures for a single division, except for the extra set of counters on whatever side government members were voting&mdash;the assumption being that it would take about half the current time for the count or thereabouts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was general support for the committee's proposals for consecutive divisions when the bells are rung for one minute, so we have adopted this point. In these cases it will be important that the chair acquaints members arriving for such a division of the full import of the question before the House before they are required to vote. Moreover, members changing sides will need to report to two sets of tellers to be removed from one list and added to another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today's motion proposes the trial of these arrangements for sitting weeks five and six. It may then be appropriate to consider whether or not we would have an extension of this trial period, if the various interested members believe that such a further trial might be useful. If the trial is a success, the new arrangements would be made permanent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion also amends standing order 204, which provides that, if there is only one member on a side for a division, the Speaker shall call off the division and, if requested, record the member's dissent. While the committee recommended the call&hyphen;off number 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be increased to eight, for the purposes of the trial the number is set at four. To assist members to acquaint themselves with the new procedures, I understand that the clerk proposes to conduct a run&hyphen;through in the chamber at a quarter to one on Tuesday, 18 March. No doubt, he will formally advise members of this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the member of Grayndler (Mr Albanese), the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), the member for Moncrieff, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and others for their assistance in putting this arrangement together.

It means that the first division is basically as it is now, but with a couple of extra tellers near where the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  reporters are seated. On a subsequent division&mdash;in other words, an immediately following division&mdash;there will be a reporting process to obviate the necessity for a second count.</PARA></TALK.START>

We will give the trial a run for a couple of weeks or a bit longer if we feel it is necessary. With a bit of luck, we will be able to then see these arrangements come in on a permanent basis. They will need, of course, the ongoing cooperation of people just to sort through the initial changeover period. But I am sure we will have the full assistance of all members.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition agrees with the proposal before the House. As the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has indicated, we were involved in some negotiations with them that have arrived at this point. I should make the point, however, that the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure, from which this proposal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2237"> has now emerged, involved majority and minority recommendations. The minority recommendation supported electronic voting as the procedure to be embraced by this House. It was rejected by the majority&mdash;essentially government members&mdash;on the basis of cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing to note that, as part of this agreement, there is a preparedness on the part of the government to seek further advice from the Speaker. A letter was written to the Speaker towards the end of last year seeking advice from him as to what, in the current circumstances, the new cost would be. There is a view that the technology has improved, the cost has been reduced and that we should not dismiss considering moving to the electronic voting system. But we do accept that, if cost is a prohibitive barrier, there is not much point proceeding with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Leader of the House has agreed to refer that matter again to the Speaker and we would obviously like a response to that as early as possible. I might say that, given the fact that we were prepared to spend half a million dollars moving a chair, it seems to me&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="REITH" NAMEID="WI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr Reith</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And you opposed it.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We opposed it because of the cost, on the basis that if that money were available it could be better spent. If the argument is that we need expedition in the voting procedures, I would have thought it would be better to spend it doing that than to provide a seat for one person. The majority of members of the Procedure Committee rejected electronic voting for those reasons, but they proposed an alternative system of voting in this House which involved a physical file&hyphen;past. This was a position not embraced by the opposition and, for that matter, the Independents. But they will speak for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, having rejected that, we did proceed to consider ways in which we could expedite procedures and the proposal that comes before us today does that. Essentially, what we will do is vote the same way as before on the first division and if a second division, a consequential one, results in the majority of one side changing sides then the second division will still be counted in the old way. If, how 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ever, the majority on one side does not look like they are going to be moving to the other side for the consequential amendment, the process involves the tellers being approached by those people wishing to change their vote, that being the method by which the tellers will ultimately record the vote. That does of course require a tally with the numbers that the clerks keep. Whether this system works will depend very much on the preparedness of those seeking to change votes in fact notifying accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other provision that is involved here is the agreement that if four or fewer members wish to have a division then that will be sufficient to effect that. That arose from consultations involving the member for Moore (Mr Filing) on behalf of other Independents in the House. We support that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, we support the change that will see the introduction of three sets of tellers. This is the Stewart McArthur amendment. This is the amendment that recognises the great difficulty that the government has with not only the numbers on their side&mdash;of which we are very envious&mdash;but also the member for Corangamite recognising who he has on his side of the House and actually recording that vote. So we have to have two lots of people counting on that side to make up for what we can do over here. For the member for Corangamite, this will go down as his amendment, and we look forward with interest to seeing how he functions in the new environment. In particular, we look forward to seeing if he is as quick as the other sets of tellers on his side of the House. This will be a very interesting competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition indicates its support for these changes. They are to be introduced on a trial basis. The trial will come into effect in the next sitting fortnight, after which we will judge its effectiveness. I thank the Leader of the House for what have been pretty civil negotiations. We have actually got on pretty well, so there has been a bit of a change this year. It is very pleasing to see. He needs to pull his hamstring more often, I think. It slows him down a bit. He does not come out with the vindictiveness and the sharp tongue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2238">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the House recognises that, despite the fact that he has the weight of numbers in the place, he actually does need some cooperation from this side from time to time. To the extent to which he is prepared to involve us genuinely in discussions about improved procedures, we are also prepared to participate. We support the motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to thank the House for the opportunity to debate this motion, which arises from a Standing Committee on Procedure report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Conduct of divisions</EMPHASIS> . It has been an interesting process to work through with the opposition the way in which we could approach this. The report of the Standing Committee on Procedure indicates that divisions, at the time these surveys were undertaken, were taking about eight minutes to be counted. That is after the four minutes of the calling of a division and the ringing of the bells. In the previous parliament, it took five to six minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have gone a little bit deeper into the analysis process. Despite the compliment&mdash;I do not know whether it was a compliment&mdash;or comments made by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) about my colleague the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), I would like to go into a few more details. Whilst you attribute to him the reason we have all these extra numbers in the House, in fact that may not be the case. The fact of the matter is that, if we take a sample over the last couple of months of divisions, the time in addition to the ringing of the bells&mdash;as best as we can account from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> records&mdash;is 7.5 minutes for the counting of a division whereas in the previous parliament the average time was 6.15 minutes. But, if you go back to the parliament before that, the average time was 7.9 minutes&mdash;even longer than now. So there is no real pattern of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have 14 additional members. My colleague the member for Corangamite and the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) have done well to cope with those large numbers. It appears from the statistics that we have taken&mdash;ad hoc, sure&mdash;that the counting time has actually varied from parliament to parliament, no doubt based on the skills of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whips involved. The most time the new counting processes could expect to save, I think, would be a little over a minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the backbench, I have to say that while a division is going on is a very important time for members to mix. Provided the opposition does not insist on calling divisions all the time, it is an important time for members of the House to join together, for members to sit next to a minister to plead their cause and to bring their case to a minister's attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I plead in regard to the counting process a little bit of consideration and a factual account on behalf of the member for Corangamite and the member for Fowler. It is a wonderful thing for the Labor Party to say `Stuey, come on, open your eyes. Come on Stuey, find the members.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but I am quoting what is said in divisions, Mr Deputy Speaker. The comments have been a little unfair. If one looks at the time taken for counting in the 36th, 37th and 38th parliaments, one will find that there is very little difference&mdash;actually, one minute is the most that I can determine is taken in addition to what has traditionally been the counting time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real savings will come from the amendments to standing orders for the successive or the consequential divisions, where it will be necessary for members to notify the tellers if they intend to change their vote. We are going to have to be careful in the trial period of two weeks because if members change their vote from one side to another they will have to notify two groups of tellers&mdash;those counting for the ayes and those counting for the noes. It will not be sufficient to tell one group of tellers if they are changing their vote. That is a matter that particularly the Independent members will have to have regard for, but they will speak for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a member has been absent from a vote and comes into the chamber&mdash;the bells are ringing for one minute and the member needs to find their place in the chamber&mdash;in that process they will have to notify a teller of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2239"> where they are actually going to be voting. Their presence cannot go unnoticed and it will no doubt be checked in an informal way by the clerks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe there could be some confusion in the process as a result of the new standing orders. The changes will be beneficial to the House. The real benefits will come from the successive divisions rather than any change in the number of tellers there are. Being a whip and identifying people in this House is not an easy task, and despite the chiacking and comments that are made, I think the whips&mdash;if I may speak for them&mdash;behave in an impeccable manner and conduct themselves with the highest professional ethic and etiquette that is required in a parliament of the type of the Australian Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that warning about the need for members to be very careful about what they do in the successive divisions&mdash;to notify tellers if there is a change, if they are coming in late or if there is any other factor that causes them to abstain from a vote&mdash;members will need to be very careful if this process is to work, otherwise there could be confusion. In fact, it could result in a longer period being taken to conduct a count.</PARA></SPEECH>

In his defence of the member for Corangamite, the Chief Government Whip makes us wonder why we are having this reform: if the government is not losing time in divisions now as

The fact is that the Procedure Committee did not consider electronic voting in any sort of detail and reject it. I would just like to quote the relevant sentence from the report. Having noted that, according to Mr Martin's report, as it says, there would be an installation cost of $3 million and ongoing support costs of $300,000 per annum, the committee made the comment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently the committee has decided to defer consideration of this option, at least until it can make further detailed inquiries into the current costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the matter was never considered in any detail. Certainly, the report of the former Speaker, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) was in front of us to look at. We gave it that much consideration but, under the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2241"> circumstances, it was just not a goer so we did not waste our time on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, as the new chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure, I found it very disappointing that the issue was referred to the Labor Party caucus and a decision was taken which bound the Labor Party members on the committee. I have never known that to happen on the Procedure Committee, and I think it was a great pity. In my experience on the Procedure Committee, it has never happened that an issue that is before the committee and being considered by the committee has gone to a party meeting for decision to bind the members of the committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The teller's form has not been a user friendly form at all. When you are trying to find your way around that form and mark off names as they are being called to you by the other teller, you simply cannot do it quickly. I understand that the form has been re 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> designed, and I am very pleased to hear that. But, again, in my experience, the hold up has not been the person calling the names; it has been the person ticking the names&mdash;and the member for Corangamite has been the caller.</PARA>

It is all very well to ridicule one of the tellers in such a manner, but the simple fact is that the people who did it do not come from a side that has ever had the luxury of 94 members. The fact that the government has nearly twice as many members as the opposition is certainly part of the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to these changes to the standing orders, I want to make a couple of observations. I might say that I support the introduction of electronic voting as a means of determining the will of the chamber. The honourable member for Cunningham, Mr Martin, the former Speaker, is quite right to push for the introduction of the electronic registration of the voting of members, because in fact that would be a liberating thing for the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) made an interesting observation, which was probably a reflection of the way in which he approaches the political process in this place; that was, to refer to crossing the floor as being a long walk or as somehow being considerably intimidating. Of course, it is. That is one of the reasons why some of these changes are going to cement the influence of the party discipline on the voting performance or the voting behaviour of members of this chamber. It is my view that it is in the interests of better representation for the citizens of Australia from their members of parliament that we introduce electronic voting as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my considered opinion that the physical act of crossing over from one side of the chamber to the other&mdash;often after a considerable amount of pressure and sometimes intimidation from colleagues not to do so&mdash;is of such considerable note that very few people actually do it. From the perspective of former colleagues in the Liberal Party, that happens much more often from the coalition side of politics than it does from the Labor Party side, which insists on their members signing a pledge not to do so&mdash;a pledge which I think is totally contradictory to the proper representation of their constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact with the introduction of electronic voting what would be of great interest to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> constituents would be being able to examine the voting record of their individual member so that when they came to an election they could actually see what their member had done as far as their voting was concerned. That would probably give constituents a far better guide to the performance of their individual member&mdash;to the way in which their member exercises his or her conscience on behalf of their constituents&mdash;than does the present situation where everybody, with the exception of the Independent members, votes according to the party lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wanted to point out, I suppose in furtherance of this, that the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith)&mdash;who I must say is much more mellow at this time than he was the last time we were talking about changes to standing orders&mdash;has been talking on a number of occasions about `opposition parties'. I want to emphasise that that is a totally incorrect term. There is only one opposition party, and that is the Labor Party. The Independent members are non-government members of this House and are not considered to be part of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make some observations about a couple of these changes which we have agreed to support. The most significant of those as far as Independent members are concerned is the change to the process where there is a minority of members on one side of the chamber who have called for a division. Under the circumstances that were being proposed, there were in fact going to be eight or fewer members, and that of course meant that the Independent members would have been in a position where they could not possibly have requested a fully counted division, which in my view is totally anti&hyphen;democratic.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that one of the problems that an Independent member encounters coming into the chamber&mdash;perhaps after the one&hyphen;minute division bell has been rung for a subsequent division&mdash;is to quickly ascertain the nature of the question that is being divided upon and to make a decision on how to vote. I am hoping that not only will the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker or whoever is present in the chair announce the question in the traditional terms but also that there will be provision for there to be a brief explanation of exactly what is occurring. As you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, would well know, at times many members in this chamber come in here and vote without knowing exactly what they are voting for.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the fourth report of the committee for 1997 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Extension to the main runway at Adelaide International Airport</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report which I have tabled concerns the proposed extension of the main runway at Adelaide International Airport. The Federal Airports Corporation, on behalf of the state and federal governments, proposes to construct a runway extension at Adelaide International Airport. This extension has been identified by the South Australian government as a priority infrastructure project. The development is supported by the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The runway extension will provide the opportunity for direct flights to Asian destinations. Direct flights are considered necessary for facilitating tourism and the export of produce and products from South Australia and thus the economic growth of the state. The estimated outturn cost of the proposed work is $48 million. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In arriving at this recommendation the committee took into account a number of factors. The current runway length of Adelaide international airport imposes payload constraints on departing wide bodied international aircraft. Under the existing arrangements&mdash;and this is a surprising statistic&mdash;more than half of the airfreight from South Australia is exported through other Australian airports. This penalises the state's export potential by reducing competitiveness due to higher transport costs, uncertainties in the timely delivery of goods and the possible reduction in the quality of perishable goods. The committee therefore concluded that there is a need to lengthen the runway to make full use of airfreight capacity, especially to Asian airports on existing flights, provide greater opportunity for direct export of South Australian products and enhance the development of international tourism to the state.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2245">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Expert advice to the committee indicated that a runway length of 3,100 metres would be sufficient to accommodate full volumetric payloads on all types of aircraft in passenger configurations to all north Asian destinations under the worst planning conditions. This length is also sufficient to accommodate Boeing 747 freighter aircraft with full payloads to South&hyphen;East Asian hubs and Boeing 747&hyphen;400 freighters to Hong Kong with a 90 per cent payload. Extending the runway to 3,100 metres will require the runway to be extended by 572 metres. Of several alternatives examined, the preferred one is to extend the main runway by 572 metres to the south west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This extension will require the diversion of Tapleys Hill Road either around the extension or underneath it. The committee has recommended that of the four configurations examined, the short deviation is preferred. The extended runway will also require the relocation of the air navigational facilities and community recreation facilities. These include: installing new lights along the runway and taxiway; relocating navigational aids, the wind direction indicator and anemometer; increasing the capacity of the airport's power generation equipment; constructing new stormwater drains, access roads and boundary fences; and reducing the height of obstacles at the end of the runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee concluded that each component in the scope of the proposed works is directly related to the runway extension and can therefore be justified. The proposal has been well publicised and an environmental impact statement and a response document were prepared at ministerial direction. As a result of community concerns about the possibility of increased levels of aircraft noise arising from the runway extensions, especially to residents in the Glenelg North area, an enhanced aircraft noise monitoring study will be undertaken at the state's expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This should allow noise readings to be assessed with precision and predictions of noise events from aircraft to be accurately forecast. It is worth noting that the phasing out of category 2 aircraft will reduce the current noise levels. When the results of this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> noise monitoring are dovetailed with the Australian noise exposure concept data, the committee recommends that consideration be given to noise amelioration for houses in Glenelg North. I commend the report to the House and thank the deputy chairman of the committee for his support in this particular study.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2245"><TITLE>Publications Committee</TITLE><DEBATE.SUB2 PAGE="2245"><TITLE>Report</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to address the deliberate, disgraceful scare campaign being waged by those opposite against elderly residents over the government's proposed improvements to nursing home accommodation. In particular, I wish to refute a newspaper article appearing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun Weekly</EMPHASIS>  today, 6 March, headed `Elderly must sell homes for a bed'. This article went on to say that, according to the member for Shortland, Peter Morris&mdash;who I see is not even in the chamber&mdash;most older Australians will now be faced with selling their homes to get a nursing home bed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this article went to press, my office has been contacted by distressed elderly constituents who have needlessly been upset by it. The member for Shortland should hang his head in shame for being responsible for creating unnecessary and unfounded concern amongst my elderly constituents. It would be far better if the member acquainted himself with the facts and spent time representing the needs of his own electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently most nursing home residents have to share bedrooms and bathrooms with other people. Nearly 40 per cent of residents share a room of four or more beds. In some homes, major upgrading is needed just to meet government fire and safety standards. This is totally unacceptable. Older people have a right to expect good quality accommodation which allows them comfort, dignity and privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Shortland has said that elderly residents will be forced to sell their family home to get care. Nothing could be further from the truth. At present around half of those people who own a home when they go into a nursing home choose to sell it. As most residents will stay in a nursing home for two or three years, this can be a sensible choice. But it will not suit everyone. They will have a wide choice of options and only they can decide which suits them best. The options they can choose from will have quite different effects on their pension, tax and nursing home daily fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's regulations for accommodation bonds in nursing homes and hostels 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2247"> provide specific protections for the family home. If a spouse is living there, the home will be protected. That means it will not be counted as an asset. A person can only be asked to pay an accommodation bond if both the person concerned and their spouse have other assets over $45,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they have a carer or close family member who has been living in their home for at least five years, and who would qualify for a government pension or benefit, their home will also be protected. They can only be asked to pay an accommodation bond if they have other assets of over $22,500 for a single person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that if they cannot afford to pay an accommodation bond, they will still be able to get a place in a nursing home. The government will ensure that nursing homes and hostels take a set number of people who cannot afford to pay, and will pay a higher subsidy for them. Accommodation bonds, as they will be named, better reflect what they really are&mdash;a bond from which the provider can draw down a maximum of $2,600 per annum for a period not exceeding five years to a maximum of $13,000, with the balance to be refunded to the resident or their estate on departure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government provides a number of special protections for residents. Concessional residents will not have to pay the bond. Nursing homes and hostels must take people who cannot pay a bond. People will not have to pay before they get a place in a nursing home. Nobody&mdash;I repeat: nobody&mdash;will be forced to sell their home. There will be measures in place to protect the residents' rights and look after their interests.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to talk about International Women's Day, which is coming up in two days time, on Saturday, 8 March. In doing so, I would very much like to recall the display that I witnessed in this place today from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He gave us an amazing claim to success in relation to women's affairs. He made a great play about the number of women on his side of the House, which I have gone on record in the past as welcoming in general. But he used that as evidence of his or his Liberal government's commitment to women in this country and somehow used their numbers as a measure of success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very famous quote&mdash;unfortunately at the moment I cannot recall the source of that quote, but it is an oft used one&mdash;which goes something like, `The day that we have so many women in this place that we do not comment on it is the day that we have, in fact, as women succeeded.' I will remind the Prime Minister, particularly, of that quote the next time I see, a day or two after a federal election, a parade of women pass the media cameras. I think it would be much better if we saw a parade of men as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was disappointed today to see this display put on in answer to a dorothy dix question from his own side. If the Prime Minister

Why just play around with a dorothy dix question?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us really have a look for a moment at what this government has done and at policy decisions which I believe have impacted so dramatically on women and their families since this government came to power. There are a number of them, and I am sure I will not have the time to go through them all. The changes to education, the Austudy fiasco, the decline in university places and the changes to HECS&mdash;some of those things specifically and particularly will impact on women in a direct fashion and, in a lot of cases, on members of families where women, as we know, are the linchpin.

A member of my family who unfortunately is mentally and physically disabled is living in an institution&mdash;not in Canberra but elsewhere&mdash;where the budget for staffing has been cut in half.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2249"> that, I want my government and the minister to know that I am here to help find a responsible and safe solution to this very real problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have lived in Sutherland Shire all my life. I went to school there and raised my children there. My own sons are now old boys from St Patricks College at Sutherland. This area is my home, but it is much more than that&mdash;it is my heartland. I have lived there all my life, along with the people of the shire who are my neighbours and who are now also my constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the history of Lucas Heights. I was in fifth class at Star of the Sea, Miranda when it was built. Sutherland Shire was then orchards and chicken farms, and where the Gymea TAFE now stands there was a dairy farm. There were also vast tracts of uninhabited bushland on the western side of the Woronora River where Lucas Heights is located.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know also that, for 40 years, the ANSTO establishment at Lucas Heights not only has acted as a responsible corporate citizen but also produces medical radioisotopes, which are vital in the delivery of health services to the whole of the Australian community, and makes a valuable contribution in the areas of education and scientific research. And it is of practical support to the universities of Australia and to the corporate sectors that play a significant part in the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The upside of this establishment is a good upside, and all are proud to share in its success. However, the downside is a downside like no other. It presents a conundrum which has to date been too hot to handle by previous governments, and most particularly by the last Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the last 13 years, spent fuel rods&mdash;the unwanted by-product of the activity at Lucas Heights&mdash;have been gathering dust and waiting for a government to make some firm decisions that will incorporate a responsible nuclear policy for Australia and that will not only address the conundrum of the spent fuel rods but also address the fate of the present reactor. With the year 2003 being the deadline, our government is at last prepared to show the leadership required to make those tough decisions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, I stood up with those on the other side of the House on the MPI, and I do not want my stand to be misinterpreted by anyone on either side of this House. I stood because this matter is of vital importance to me and to the people of Hughes; and I am here to stand up for my constituents. But I did not stand up to be against the Minister for Science and Technology, because I do support his commitment and his courage in tackling this most difficult issue which was put in the `just too hot to handle' bucket by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to speak ill of others, but those on the other side would do well to beware of the wrath of a gentle woman. I cannot continue to sit and listen, as I did yesterday, as they entertained themselves and the nation with their own rosy view of their commitment to this matter and to hear them pretend to be concerned about us, the people of Hughes. What a load of humbug, hypocrisy and wishful history was presented here yesterday!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) lecture the Minister for Science and Technology that he had some hard decisions to make. Well, I could hardly believe my ears. For the last 13 years, my family and my neighbours in Hughes have been waiting for the Labor government to do just that&mdash;some hard decisions, some hard planning, some hard leadership perhaps, some guts perhaps, some real commitment to the people perhaps. For the last 13 years, they have sat fat on the treasury bench, constipated by their own inactivity, indecision and ineptitude on this issue. For the last 13 years, they've dumped on me and my family and my neighbours while we waited for a decisive leadership that never came.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I often look across at that side of the House from the place here where I sit, and I look upon a front row of real Labor heavies whom you would think could take on the world. But they dumped any sense of responsibility that they should have had for me, my family and my community&mdash;and for the 260,000 residents of Sutherland Shire. I think that they are only men of straw. They are all puff and whistle. For 13 years, the Labor government al

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a member who has failed hand over fist to give any shred of decent representation to her electorate.

She is a gross failure. For the people in Hughes who want to do something about the problem, there is one easy answer: vote her out at the earliest possible opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Having dispensed with that matter, let me turn to my concern which is of genuine interest to people in my electorate. My con 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stituents are very concerned about a nuclear reprocessing plant through the south-west of Sydney, which would take the nuclear material all through those suburban areas. It is bad enough to have the airport noise, but now of course there is the real threat of nuclear accidents in our backyard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this government is failing in other areas. I express my concern about the representative features of the Constitutional Centenary Foundation schools convention which has started in Canberra today. This is a convention that has been organised at some taxpayer expense to look at the Australian constitution through the eyes of school students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been 30 students selected from New South Wales. How many of them are from western and south-western Sydney, the great triangle of population from Parramatta to Penrith to Campbelltown? Zero. How many students are in that region as a proportion in New South Wales? About a quarter of the school students in New South Wales come from the western and south&hyphen;western Sydney regions. How much representation do they get from the government's Constitutional Centenary Foundation? Absolutely zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not one student selected from western or south-western Sydney to be sitting here in Canberra at some taxpayer expense talking about the future of their Australian constitution. Doesn't that send a bad signal for the government's approach to constitutional change via conventions? Is this the sort of representative feature that we will have from this elitist government for its constitutional convention later in 1997?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no representation whatsoever from all the young people in western and south-western Sydney at this schools convention. I go to their schools and I listen to these active young citizens talk about their interest in the Australian constitution. Their views are mainly in favour of the republic and other aspects of constitutional change. But why won't the Howard government give them a voice? Why is it that there are four representatives from the North Shore of Sydney to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2251"> this schools constitutional convention? But from all the students in the western and south-western suburbs of Sydney there is absolutely none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason, of course, lies in the elitism of this government&mdash;the elitism of a government where the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) confiscates the best bit of public housing in Sydney, the only bit of public housing they support, Kirribilli House, for his private residence.

The view from Kirribilli&mdash;that is the reason we do not have fair representation for people in western and south&hyphen;western Sydney. That is why this government can only provide international airports and nuclear reprocessing plants for the people of that region&mdash;because the Prime Minister is out of touch.

First, I might say generally about the plight of small businessmen: let us hope that it is alleviated after Saturday week when the Soorley administration is removed from office, particularly with the imposts that they have delivered to small businesses with their outrageous signage costs. That has been an awful impost on small businesses in my electorate. So those businesses will be very keen to see the removal of the Soorley administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to bring to the House's attention in particular the plight of a panel beater in my electorate. A person whose car had been damaged came to see him to obtain a quote for repairs. He gave the quote to the client, who had already been to see another panel beater, and the particular quote was the lowest quote. The panel beater asked the client whether it was okay if he arranged for an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> assessor to come and assess the particular damage and to see if the quote was in order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The client said that that would be all right, so he contacted Suncorp, one of the biggest banks&mdash;in fact, I think it is now the biggest bank in Queensland or it will be soon&mdash;as well as being the largest insurer. He rang Suncorp and a claims officer took details. Later an assessor called out, looked at the car and told my constituent, who is the proprietor of Dukes Smash Repairs, Mr Dodt, that the client did not want him, Mr Dodt, to repair the vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Dodt was a little bit suspicious of this and spoke to the client about this. It transpires that the assessor had told the client that he would not get a warranty if Mr Dodt repaired the vehicle. This was a totally outrageous situation because Mr Dodt in fact supplies two warranties when he does repairs. So this was simply not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was quite clear that the assessor was trying to persuade the client to take the car from Mr Dodt and have it repaired somewhere else. In reality, as result of the representations of the assessor acting on Suncorp's behalf, the vehicle was towed some 40 kilometres away from Mr Dodt's premises to some premises at Capalaba. In the towing process, he would have passed hundreds of other panelbeating shops&mdash;in particular, many in Brendale in my electorate, and many others in the electorate of Lilley and in the electorate of my friend from Petrie. The car was taken all the way to Capalaba to a quote that was not lower than the quote of Mr Dodt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear after the work had been done at Capalaba that there were some unsatisfactory elements to that work and the client returned the vehicle to Mr Dodt. It is outrageous  in  my  view  that  a  large  and

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) No, the quarantine assessment by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, AQIS, has carefully considered the risk of Newcastle disease becoming established in the Australian poultry industry and in the native bird population through the importation of cooked chicken meat. AQIS 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bases its quarantine decisions on thorough scientific assessment of the risk of introduction of pests and diseases. AQIS conclusions are supported by independent experts including most of the state veterinary authorities, the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, the Bureau of Resource Sciences and Dr Dennis Alexander, a renowned international virologist. AQIS considers that a decision under the Quarantine Act to permit the importation of cooked chicken meat for human consumption, subject to proposed specified strict conditions, would present a negligible level of risk of introduction of exotic Newcastle disease virus to either commercial or wild birds in Australia and therefore to tourist destinations such as the Featherdale Wildlife Park in the electoral division of Greenway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) AQIS is developing strict import protocols for cooked chicken meat. These include meeting standards set by AQIS for foreign poultry slaughter and processing plants to obtain AQIS approval before commencing export to Australia. AQIS will require ante mortem and post mortem inspection of birds by veterinary authorities in exporting countries to ensure clinically healthy birds are used. AQIS also will require plants to meet comparable standards of construction and hygiene to those found at Australian poultry plants. The conditions proposed by AQIS are similar to but more conservative than conditions applied to the extensive range of Australian food products exported overseas. In addition AQIS is also commissioning final confirmatory tests to demonstrate that the proposed conditions will reliably inactivate Newcastle disease virus and infectious bursal disease virus (the most heat resistant avian pathogen of concern) if present in chicken meat. The import requirements proposed by AQIS will reliably protect the environment, avian industry and Australian consumers from risk of disease introduction with imported cooked chicken meat.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Telstra plans to reduce employment numbers nationally by around 22,000 between June 1996 and June 1999.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government recognises the importance of ensuring that areas outside capital cities participate in and benefit from the opportunities offered by access to new telecommunications services. The Commonwealth Government has put in place a number of initiatives that will enhance the development of, and access to, online infrastructure and services in non&hyphen;metropolitan Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund (RTIF) will provide $250m funding over five years to community initiated communications projects, which demonstrate a benefit to people in regional and rural Australia. The program will address both equity and economic objectives. On equity grounds, the Government considers that people in rural and regional areas should have the opportunity to access appropriate communications services at reasonable cost and on a similar basis to metropolitan users. On economic grounds, improved telecommunications infrastructure and services can stimulate economic activity, boost employment and assist in the provision of education, training, health and other government services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Communications and the Arts will appoint a Board to oversee the operations of the fund.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Online Public Access Initiative (OPAI) has been established by the Commonwealth Government and $2 million was provided in the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget for projects which enhance public access to online services. OPAI will provide grants to eligible non&hyphen;profit organisations (such as public libraries or similar community groups, or local and state government bodies on behalf of such community groups) in both metropolitan and non&hyphen;metropolitan areas. Projects which will enhance community access to online services in rural and remote communities are, however, a priority for the program. Approximately 20 projects across Australia, at an average of $100 000 per project, are expected to receive funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The program was advertised nationally in January and early February and project proposals were due by 28 February 1997. There has been widespread interest, particularly from rural and regional areas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to these new programs, the Information Policy Advisory Council (IPAC) has formed a special working group to investigate online infrastructure and services development in regional and rural Australia. The IPAC working group is considering the policy options available to the Government for promoting the development of infrastructure and information services in non&hyphen;metropolitan Australia, and will report to the Government in March 1997. As part of its investigation, the working group is conducting an assessment of the current level of regional and rural online development, which will include an overview of prices and affordability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government established the Standard Telephone Service Review to investigate the continuing appropriateness of service levels under the universal service arrangements. The review has recommended options for upgrading the actual services accessible under the universal service obligation, including a recommendation by the majority of the review that, by the year 2000 a digital data capability should be reasonably accessible to all Australians on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While these are significant initiatives, they cannot provide solutions to all of rural Australia's communications needs. In the longer term funding for the majority of communications infrastructure and services to metropolitan and rural consumers can only come from the private sector.
