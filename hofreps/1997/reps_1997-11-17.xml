<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report I table today follows the inquiry by the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts into the funding of community sporting and recreational facilities. This report was almost completed by the committee under the chairmanship of the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), beside me, and before my appointment to the committee and election as Chair. The recommendations, conclusions and general findings therefore reflect the views of the committee members rather than my own views. But I do not necessarily disagree with anything in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years the only facilities that the Commonwealth government has funded have been for the Olympic Games in Sydney. It has not contributed any funds for facilities of other standards. The committee learnt, during its visits to all the Australian states and territories, that there is a strong demand for Commonwealth funding for facilities of all standards to be restored. The committee has not, however, recommended establishing a general grants program like that which existed in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current situation is that local government spends large sums of money each year on sport and recreation, and the state and territory governments dispense funds for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> facilities through grants programs. The committee concludes that an appropriate role for the Commonwealth government is to enhance the effective use of those funds that are already available, and it has identified several ways of doing this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of these is that an audit of all sporting and recreational facilities in the country should be carried out, and the results made available on a database. More emphasis should be put on needs based planning, especially at national and regional levels. Educational institutions and Defence Force bases should be encouraged to share their facilities more effectively with the community than they do at present. Finally, information relating to all aspects of establishing and running facilities is to be provided&mdash;standards, design, planning, management, joint ventures between the private and public sectors and shared use of facilities were all nominated as topics about which more information is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as promoting the best possible use of the funds that are currently being provided, the committee concludes that the Commonwealth government should also make some grant funds available for individual facilities in disadvantaged communities. The committee considers that partial funding should be provided for facilities in these communities where facilities have not been constructed, despite the best efforts of state and local government, the community and the private sector. The committee sees the supply of funding to these communities as being in keeping with the government's role of ensuring that all Australians have access to broadly similar services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To avoid the problems that have bedevilled past Commonwealth grants programs for facilities, the funds should be dispensed in cooperation with state and territory governments. The committee recommends that $50 million should be made available each year for the next five years for the new grants program for disadvantaged communities and for the other measures recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also discusses how more funds might be made available for sporting and recreational facilities by means other than a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10436"> Commonwealth grants program. The committee looked at the Australian Sports Foundation, which allows for tax deductible donations to sporting facilities, among other things. The foundation has not contributed as effectively as it should have to the provision of facilities, although it has the potential to do so. Its operations must be reformed and extended, and the committee recommends as much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An alternative source of money is a revolving loan fund, which the committee recommends should be investigated as an option. The committee suggests that a fund of $100 million might be established using funds raised by the Commonwealth government from the regulation of gambling associated with telecommunications and air travel. The committee does not support the introduction of these forms of gambling. But, if they are introduced, any revenue from such gambling should be hypothecated to sport and recreational facilities. In addition, the joint development of facilities by the private and public sectors should be made easier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee considers that the report's recommendations, taken together, will make a substantial contribution to a better supply of sporting and recreational facilities for the Australian public. I would like to acknowledge the contribution of all the members of the committee who have participated in this inquiry. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rethinking the funding of community sporting and recreational facilities: a sporting chance</EMPHASIS> , which has been tabled this afternoon, is a welcome update on two previous committee reports on the same subject matter. The first, I think, was back in the early 1980s; and then the committee which I chaired in 1989 brought down a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Going for gold</EMPHASIS> &mdash;and I think the report on this occasion has surpassed even the work that was done then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset I pay tribute to both the present chairman and also the former chairman, now the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), for his outstanding guidance during the course of this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular work. Of course, as the shadow minister for sport and tourism, I was particularly interested in participating in the course of this inquiry because it did build on the work, as I say, that I did in the late 1980s. But it has always interested me to see how the Commonwealth should play a role in the provision of community sporting and recreation facilities&mdash;and, more importantly, how one pays for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us in this place can stand up and say: `There should be more community sports facilities in Australia,' but then we have to work out how the Commonwealth pays for its share of those facilities. What appeals to me is that we have made some recommendations in this committee report that go to the funding issue. The chairman just mentioned some of those a moment ago. I am particularly attracted to the idea of beefing up the role of the Australian Sports Foundation. With increased tax deductibility, for example, there is an opportunity for corporate Australia to donate funds which can then be directed towards the provision of sporting infrastructure in this country&mdash;and not just concentrate them in the Australian Institute of Sport, which is certainly necessary, but in regional centres right around this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally commendable is the notion that there should be shared use of facilities. There is no point in each community or each sport having its own little sportsground, its own shed or its own basketball facility somewhere. There should be shared facilities. We had a look at the way that schools, defence establishments and other places could be utilised for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also looked at the issue of planning. Regional facilities were seen as being so important in this area. Again, there is no point in a local government saying that it wants a brand new tartan track athletics facility, a brand new aquatic facility, a brand new water based hockey facility, netball courts and so on. All those are important but if we are talking about major facilities we have to take a regional approach. Local government these days must have a regional focus instead of focusing on the parochial issues which seem to surround much of its activities in this area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10437">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Local government has the added burden that once state or Commonwealth governments come along and give them funds to construct some of these facilities they then have to pick up the wherewithal for the maintenance costs associated with that. These are important issues. In the process we have talked about in this committee report, of having a committee that plans with state, local and federal government involvement, you can go to the issues of maintaining the funding that is so necessary for the maintenance of all these facilities once planned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea of providing $50 million a year for each of the next five years is also appealing. We need to get away from the Sydney 2000 Games concept and think about the rest of Australia. Regional Australia cries out for sporting facilities and needs the impetus that can come from Commonwealth government funding. I used an example on a number of occasions in the course of this committee's work of an indoor sports entertainment centre in Wollongong. Had Commonwealth government funding been available for the extra few million that had been promised by Brian Howe's better cities program and regional facilities program we might have seen that facility built a little more quickly than it is being done at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is a report of substance. It is testimony to the work of the committee secretariat, which worked long and hard to put it together. I thank them on behalf of the opposition. It is a report which will be an important element as the opposition prepares its policy on sport and funding for sports facilities as we go to the next election campaign. Fortunately, in this country sport is very much a bipartisan issue. Both sides of the parliament should endorse this report. I hope the new Minister for Sport and Tourism (Mr Thomson) is spoken to at length by his colleague the new Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) and that he gets hold of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and suggests that in the next budget money be found to facilitate the development of the projects outlined in this report.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to comment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on this report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rethinking the funding of community sporting and recreational facilities: a sporting chance</EMPHASIS> . It is a very important report, particularly given that sport is a vital part of Australian culture. Over an extensive period of time governments across Australia have invested, not hundreds of millions or even billions, but hundreds of billions of dollars in sporting facilities at the local, state and federal levels. One of the submissions to our committee indicated that around $8 billion is spent annually on the maintenance of sporting facilities across Australia at the local, state and federal levels. When you put your mind to it, it is easy to conceive of those sorts of sums being involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a diversity of needs in Australia in relation to sporting facilities. That diversity has increased with the development of new sports over the last 20 years and over the last five years, in particular. Those new sports, which have significant consumer demand attached to them, require new and sometimes very expensive facilities. Sport is no longer simply taking a pig's bladder down to the local park and kicking it around. In many cases it extends to more capital intensive sports such as golf and other capital intensive sports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The standards required for Australian sporting facilities have never been addressed in any national fashion. One of the recommendations&mdash;which I am pleased to say I contributed to in this report&mdash;is an invitation to the government, as part of its role as the Commonwealth in this relationship, to set up a national standards system so that each sporting facility, from an international sports arena that caters for international rugby or cricket games and the Olympics right through to a locally maintained sports or cricket oval, is graded according to a consistent grading pattern across the country. Therefore, we will be able to determine as a nation and as a Commonwealth before we fund these facilities exactly what facilities are available, what standard they are at and whether those sorts of facilities are needed. There are certain 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10438"> circumstances where grade one, top grade, facilities are built within 10 kilometres of each other and yet a grade one facility would not be located anywhere, for example, in regional or rural New South Wales. The demand is out there but the facilities and the money are not getting to those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding is an issue that will continue to cause some concern to the Commonwealth, given that the states and particularly local government commit so much money to sporting facilities. There is a great opportunity for us at the moment to provide a one&hyphen;off capital injection into the provision of new sporting facilities around Australia for those areas that are most in need. That, of course, is provided by the proceeds of the sale of Telstra. I would like to see some of those proceeds made available for capital infrastructure, which does belong to the Commonwealth, in a range of areas, including sporting facilities&mdash;just part of it because most of the proceeds are going to debt reduction. I might add that the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) has done a great job in relation to the privatisation of Telstra. Those funds should be available for some capital requirements and infrastructure needed by the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to funding generally, I have grave concerns about any recommendations which may indicate that we are prepared to provide funding only on a tied basis. I am a strong opponent of tied funding. It is regressive and it does not necessarily mean that you are getting the sporting facilities to the areas of greatest demand. The states, and local government in particular, should be responsible for identifying the funding needs of sporting facilities and they should approach us rather than us approaching them on where sporting facilities would best be placed. There are a couple of examples in my own electorate: the North Sydney Council together with some local community groups approached me about a basketball court and Lane Cove Council has come to me about a swimming pool. They are demand driven demands from the individual councils and ones which I, as a local federal member, would not be able to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> identify. I commend the report to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to make a few comments on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rethinking the funding of committee sporting and recreational facilities: a sporting chance</EMPHASIS> , which has just been tabled here in the House today. In so doing I would like to place on the record my congratulations to the previous chairman and now Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), and also to wish the now chairman of the committee, the member for Page (Mr Causley), all the best in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More particularly, no matter how good we as a committee work in taking evidence, listening to inquiries or reading the substantial amount of written submissions that we receive, particularly in this inquiry, we would get nowhere without the excellent secretariat. I would like to place on record in this parliament thanks for the work done by the committee secretary, Mr Ian Dundas, and in this particular report Dr Sarah Hnatiuk, who is sitting in here listening to the debate, the senior research officer, Susan Cardell, and the administrative officer, Marlene Lyons. They not only worked very hard but also put together from a wealth of knowledge a tremendous report that did not require a lot of amendment at a committee level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally we all have different opinions about where we should be going with funding. While I sat and listened to the evidence in this inquiry&mdash;I have always believed that the Commonwealth should be involved in funding particular sporting facilities&mdash;what came across very clearly is that the federal government must be involved in funding to provide and investigate options for greater provision of facilities in the sporting and recreational fields but particularly also to encourage more joint public and private sector involvement in the provision of better planned and coordinated sporting facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sydney Olympics, which the previous speakers have talked about, will focus our population on the great many men and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10439"> women&mdash;and so it should&mdash;who are champions in their own particular fields and who have had the opportunity of excellent training and facilities. But what concerns me, and I think every member of the committee that attended during this inquiry, is the other 98 per cent of our population in Australia who wish to compete or play or just become involved in sport for recreation purposes but who have no opportunities because of lack of facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was evidence given by various groups from remote areas as well as from a number of sporting communities and bodies from metropolitan and city areas stating that without federal funding involvement they would never be able to provide even the most basic facilities. Women's sporting groups also complained of and were able to provide proof of certain local government areas spending less on sporting facilities for women even when the need was shown to be there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has also come across from this inquiry is that there is a large unmet demand for more sporting and recreational facilities across Australia. We really are wasting government dollars as well as time by trying to educate our young people to become more active and more involved in sport when, at the same time, we are not providing the appropriate facilities for them to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments of all political persuasions print many glossy documents. I am convinced that all that does is make them feel good because it is absolutely useless if we print glossy documents saying to people, `Get involved, get active, look after your physical health; do you realise that if you take more recreational time off you will be a lot better?' and yet at the same time provide neither facilities nor funding to assist those people to become involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also too often hear how sport and recreation is an integral part of our Australian culture. This inquiry has shown that if you are female you are certainly not included in that culture, if you are Aboriginal and live in remote areas then you are not included and if you are disabled then you are certainly not included in what we now call `our sporting culture of Australia'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of recommendations in this report and I personally believe that if they are acted upon they will greatly relieve the anomalies that have now come to light. There has to be a very flexible and innovative approach to sports funding and the lead must come from the federal government. The recommendations identify a number of strategies that can very easily be put into place as well as costings of future requirements of sporting and recreational facilities. I commend the report to the House. I know that there are a lot of speakers who wish to participate in this debate today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add my congratulations to all the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts for producing an excellent report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rethinking the funding of committee sporting and recreational facilities: a sporting chance</EMPHASIS> . I would particularly like to acknowledge the work of Sarah Hnatiuk and Susan Cardell of the committee secretariat who have travelled long and far with us, put up with a number of rather unusual ideas that we have discussed openly and frankly on the way through and have finished up with an excellent report that the parliament should pay particular attention to. I would also like to add my congratulations to the committee chairs. I say `chairs' because there were a number of them. The member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) led the charge, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) acted in that capacity while the member for Wide Bay was called to higher duties and we closed off with the member for Page (Mr Causley) at the helm doing an excellent job in bringing the report to conclusion. My congratulations to each and every one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an important inquiry because sports funding with Commonwealth involvement has had a contentious history. We all know about whiteboards and the sorts of things in the report of the Australian National Audit Office and the report of our predecessor committee into that program, which identified many deficiencies, and I am convinced that this report deals with the vast majority of those deficiencies and maps a very practical and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10440"> pragmatic way forward for the Commonwealth to be again involved in the funding of community sporting and recreational facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the Commonwealth reacquaint itself with this program, as the old program that the previous government ran was defunct and was wound up after the difficulties that those two inquiries identified. This was a significant inquiry. The amount of evidence we received was huge. We had the experience of everyone from all around the country, an enormous level of community interest and support for what we were doing and an excellent range of submissions. The input and case studies that we looked at as we travelled around the country, particularly in the Mornington Peninsula, where we went through the electorates of Dunkley and Flinders to look at practical lessons that we could pick up, have proved to be most helpful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What our travels also identified is that we have facility rich and facility poor communities throughout our country, and that is what this report seeks to target. It says that there is a role for the Commonwealth to support community access to appropriate facilities and in fact give people, as the report's name says, a sporting chance, an opportunity to develop those skills and be involved in recreation opportunities that many of us take for granted. It identified that facilities vary right across the nation and that we need a planning framework and a bit of an audit to find out what we actually have. We understand that in educational facilities we have got recreational complexes that are underutilised and could be made more available to the community. We have also recognised that the federal government continues to provide funding through school funding, university funding and Defence facilities and that we should encourage the opening up of those to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also recognises that displacing private investment from the many people who run sporting and recreational facilities with government funding is hardly a sensible way to go, and that we should recognise that the private sector has a very legitimate and long&hyphen;established role in providing these sorts of facilities to areas of our community. It has also identified that, where there is a com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> munity service obligation, an option may well be for the government and its taxpayers, whether it is at a state, local or federal level, to buy space, to buy time and to buy access to facilities that taxpayers have already funded for private purposes, and then we can maximise the benefit of those facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a role for voluntary organisations in the management of smaller facilities. That has been recognised and encouraged. But the need for professional management not captive to a particular sporting group in multifaceted facilities was recognised as a very important thing to have in larger facilities. That understanding says that feasibility planning is important. Let us not build white elephants; let us take the sporting associations and people with us so that everyone can make sure that the facilities that are being developed are needed and can enjoy a viable future. There is also acknowledgment of regional cooperation and multi&hyphen;use as cornerstones of the things we can do and of the need for proper planning so that what you are actually building is what the community is looking for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to close by suggesting that the report's approach is affordable. It is an approach that recommends a cooperative effort between states and local government, not simply handing the money over, because we understand that the demands on governments might see a simple increase in untied grants go elsewhere. The report is saying that we should work with those levels of government and the sporting associations to produce better facilities to improve the access for everybody so that all Australians have a sporting chance. I would like to continue my remarks later in the Main Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of satisfaction to table the first major report in this parliament of an inquiry by the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. The report just tabled deals with the availability and use of concession cards by Australians who rely on the concessions provided by the cards to access a range of health and other essential services. Concession cards assist in providing services to those whose financial circumstances may prevent such access.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Commonwealth level, all concession cards provide access to the PBS safety net, and some cards give discounts on hearing aids and rail transport. States and territories provide additional concessions for electricity and water charges, as well as council rates and public transport. Almost five and a half million Australians use one or more of the three Commonwealth concession cards currently available. In addition, there are two repatriation health cards issued by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, in recognition of the special status that veterans have in the Australian community and to provide them with free health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry was first referred to the committee by the Minister for Social Security, Senator the Hon. Jocelyn Newman, in June last year. It was referred against the background that the current legislative and admin 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> istrative framework for the Commonwealth concession system is unduly complex, leading to confusion for service providers and concession card holders, causing delays and duplication at the bureaucratic level. The major conclusion reached by the committee is that there are too many cards available, which means that there is a lack of clarity about the range of concessions attaching to a particular card and that card holders are not sure of their entitlements. For this reason, the committee favours replacing the three current cards with a single concession card, entitled the Commonwealth concession card.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In assisting the effectiveness of the proposed new arrangements, the committee proposes that the new Commonwealth concession card contain a computer chip. This will enable service providers to confirm entitlements on line, assist card holders to update their information and access services more easily and allow governments at all levels to track concession expenditure and direct funds accordingly. A related recommendation is the adoption of an electronic pharmaceutical claims system, which would assist in more rational drug use and provide better health outcomes for individuals and for the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee, in its report, has made recommendations to streamline the current system, with primary responsibility for administration and management being transferred to the Social Security portfolio. This is to be undertaken in a manner which is sensitive to the special status provided to veterans in the allocation of their cards. The committee has also recommended the strengthening of existing fraud control mechanisms and, in the interests of equity, that the Department of Social Security undertake a thorough review of eligibility criteria, taking into account all of the issues canvassed throughout the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the new streamlined administration, a recommendation has also been made that the Commonwealth, state and territory governments formally adopt a written agreement setting out national standards for concessions to remove the confusion. This should ensure a fairer system with greater transparen 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10442"> cy for recipients and more cost&hyphen;effective administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recommendation which greatly assists people in rural and remote areas, which is an issue addressed comprehensively by the committee, relates to transport concessions. There is a range of recommendations contained in the report, and time prevents me from discussing all of those, but the emphasis on providing equity and justice to rural Australians has been very prominent in the minds of the members of the committee in the preparation of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though I have been a member of the committee since its establishment in this parliament, I have occupied the position of chairman only since September this year. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank the previous chairman, Mr Peter Slipper, the member for Fisher, for his hard work and dedication in steering the inquiry through the information gathering part of its activities. I would also like to thank all committee members and the personnel of the secretariat for their assistance in the conduct of the inquiry. We look forward to some positive outcomes as governments respond to the range of recommendations contained in the report. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too welcome the opportunity to speak on the report of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Concessions&mdash;who benefits?</EMPHASIS>  As reports go, and we get to present a few in this place, this report is a very innovative and constructive approach to what for a long time has been a cause for concern not only to Commonwealth recipients but also to local, state and federal governments. How many of us in our electorate offices are bombarded by calls from people who are unsure of what concession is attached to what Commonwealth card, what entitlements flow from the possession of such a card and why the government has the temerity to place a threshold that discriminates against them. Hopefully, once the committee's recommendations are adopted by the government&mdash;and this is a unanimous report&mdash;the position 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the concession card in Australian society will change forever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For too long in this country we have had the farcical situation whereby Australian citizenship has been subjugated and state entitlements have taken precedence. If you happen to be a Tasmanian pensioner who wishes to visit the mainland states, you had better realise before you leave that travel concessions are not yours to claim once you enter the new state boundary. If you are a person with a disability and require transport concessions in another state, forget it, you are on your own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report, as the chairman, the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), mentioned, has 26 recommendations for the government to consider. As I said earlier, this is an innovative report, and for its recommendations to be properly implemented there needs to be a very effective educational process undertaken.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Recommendation 8 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . before and during introduction of concession smart cards, there should be an extensive education campaign informing the target populations, particularly older people, how the new technology will affect them and how they can gain access to concessions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why do I mention this recommendation first? Because we as a committee are putting to the government that there be a single Commonwealth concession card with smart card technology capacity to deal with all possible information. We are hopeful that, once the initial teething problems are ironed out and the concession smart card trials are completed, we will have introduced across Australia a single concession smart card to access all Commonwealth, state and territory concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This smart card will, thankfully, replace once and forever the current pensioner concession card, the health care card and the Commonwealth seniors health card. Some of us hope&mdash;and I know we might upset the veterans community&mdash;that the veterans card will also be incorporated. Hopefully, that will happen inevitably as time progresses, but I will leave that alone; I do not want to upset the veterans.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10443">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allied to this somewhat radical step is that the Commonwealth is to ensure that the relevant equipment&mdash;smart card readers, customer kiosks, information lines, et cetera&mdash;are available to all eligible Australians, irrespective of where they might live, whether it is in the Sydney CBD, the Mallee or in southern parts of my electorate in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 15 is also very important, as we are recommending that the Commonwealth and states formally adopt a written agreement on the following national standards for concessions. These are: horizontal equity&mdash;similar outcomes for households in similar circumstances; vertical equity&mdash;ability to respond to different household circumstances; clarity for recipients; cost&hyphen;effective administration; flexibility to respond to tariff and price changes and differences across Australia; consistency with competition policies and practices; and a recognition that concessions should not try to compensate for deficiencies in the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to briefly mention recommendation 21, which is that the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development initiate a negotiation process with all state and territory transport ministers to implement a national transport concession system on all rail and bus services. Recommendation 22 recommends that the mobility allowance be extended to allow disabled people to access all forms of transport in areas where there are no transport services specific to their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, as time is running out, I would like to thank the committee secretariat, Bjarne Nordin and Bronwen Jaggers, who are both here in the House today. To the civil libertarians, who are going to jump out of the woodwork over this issue: go and hide. The recipients need it, want it and they are going to get it. Find something else to worry about.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I would like to thank the new Chairman of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), for his kind words on my role as chairman of the committee right through the inquiry process. I was very honoured when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) invited me to be Government Whip, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but the downside was that it was necessary for me to resign as chairman just as the committee was about to consider the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Concessions&mdash;who benefits?</EMPHASIS> , which is now before the chamber. I was particularly impressed with the very strong support which this inquiry received from the community. Indeed, we received more than 44 submissions nationally. As happens with inquiries of this nature, the public hearings took place in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Hobart and Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a unanimous report, and I must say that the committee worked very well together. As we discussed the various issues, it was often difficult to know what the political allegiances of individuals were. I believe that the committee system, because it works so well, can restore the faith of the Australian community in the way the parliament works. So often on television, altercations within the parliament are portrayed, but the very good work of committees does not get the publicity and the profile that it should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 26 recommendations, and the key recommendation stresses the importance of having a single concession card and also that we ought to take advantage of technology and have a smart card. I believe this is a very important initiative. As a committee we did receive recommendations that maybe we ought to cash out concession cards and that people who are currently in receipt of them ought to receive compensation in a cash form for the loss of cards. I can see some advantages in this proposal; however, the feeling generally was that what might be good policy certainly would not be good politics. Most of the evidence we received gave very strong indications that the client community was opposed to cashing out. Thus, instead, we decided to rationalise and improve the administration of the concession card system. Therefore, we will not have cashing out; what we will have is a maintenance of the situation where a concession card is available to those people who need it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was particularly pleased that the committee recommended the acceptance of a Canadian Pharmanet system which will, I believe, bring about very great advantages for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10444"> people who seek to have prescriptions filled. There will be benefits to the community in so far as overprescribing will stop. People will not receive too many drugs and indeed, if there are drugs to which people might have an adverse reaction, this certainly could be identified very early. So we do have a win&hyphen;win situation: if the Pharmanet proposal is to be implemented, the win will be to the community and also to the individual patient. This is very important indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also briefly, in the time available to me, like to refer to the recommendations dealing with the extension of eligibility for the Commonwealth seniors health card. We did receive quite a lot of evidence indicating that independent retirees in particular were greatly disadvantaged by the very good work of the government in having five successive interest rate reductions since the time of the election. Many people who have planned their retirement with an expectation of a certain income are now finding it very difficult to live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Association of Independent Retirees made a recommendation which it estimated would cost $9.5 million per year. But, when the Department of Social Security and the Australian Bureau of Statistics actually checked the figures, this cost was actually calculated to be $19.5 million. So what the committee has done is recommend that the eligibility criteria for the Commonwealth seniors health card be extended to include independent retirees whose income does not exceed, by more than 40 per cent, the income limit set for qualification of a part pension. Personally, I was attracted to the recommendation of the Association of Independent Retirees. I recognise the former national president, Mrs Maureen Kingston, in the gallery. I believe the recommendation of the committee does, however, go a long way towards ensuring justice to these Australians who have contributed so much to ensuring that we enjoy the freedom and way of life that we do in this country today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Concessions&mdash;who 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefits?</EMPHASIS>  by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. At the outset I would like to thank Mr Bjarne Nordin and Ms Bronwen Jaggers for their contribution. As always, the secretariat carried out very professional and supportive work for the committee. It is also perhaps of interest to point out that this has been the first major report for many members of the parliament. I trust they have found their contribution to public policy making of value. I confess that I am concerned at the moment that people are not attending parliamentary committees. I would draw to your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to that of the Speaker, that all parliamentarians should be encouraged to partake as fully as possible in what is the most effective form of public policy making available to parliamentarians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report has two main strands: the first consists of the concessions, how they work, who they should apply to and how they function; the second relates to the physical card itself or the technology, if you like. In terms of the first strand&mdash;and this point has been made by other speakers&mdash;there is a need to get a truly national system whereby people with concession cards, whether they live in Bourke, Launceston, Burnie or Broome, all have access to similar systems. What we have found is an absolute potpourri of concessions, rules and conditions. As the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) said earlier, people who come from Tasmania across to the mainland may as well be visiting another country, because people with concessions in their own state find those concessions are not available elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report tries to give some leadership to the Commonwealth and to encourage the Commonwealth and states to develop a universal approach to it. It also points out that access to the transport card is strictly limited to those people in areas where there are public transport systems. Technically, there is no reason why such concessions could not apply to either private transport or home and community care and community transport, which are available in many places. In that way, those people who provide transport as volunteers could become part of a transport 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10445"> network. That would make it more equitable for people living outside those relatively physically small parts of the country that have a public transport system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also highlights the need for an information system. There is a great deal of confusion about concession cards, both Commonwealth and state, because of those massive variations. I think recommendation 17 is particularly important in that regard. The other recommendation of significance is the recommendation that Social Security takes over responsibility for concessions as a single department. At the moment, responsibility for concessions is split between departments, and that leads to problems. If we are going to have universality, better information and a more seamless system then we probably need to have a single department administering, with other departments feeding into that. We expect that that single responsibility would help the system to work more effectively.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">By the time the debate on this motion has concluded, three more people in Australia will be diagnosed with diabetes, because every 12 minutes someone somewhere in Australia is diagnosed with diabetes. This is a matter that should be of concern to all Australians, but especially to us as members of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This disease is reaching epidemic proportions. An estimated 800,000 Australians now have the disease, with half of those people having non-insulin dependent diabetes and not even knowing it. Because of increases in the prevalence of risk factors and the ageing of the population, the prevalence of diabetes is expected to continue to rise. Unless something is done to slow this progression, 1.15 million Australians will have diabetes by the year 2010. New research has shown that early diagnosis of diabetes, good control of blood glucose levels and regular medical checks help people with diabetes to prevent, delay or minimise complications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday, 14 November, was World Diabetes Day, when diabetes organisations around the world attempted to raise public awareness of the serious impact diabetes is having on global health. World Diabetes Day links countries around the world in an international drive to alert people to the seriousness of diabetes, the risk factors for non-insulin dependent diabetes and the ongoing need for research in pursuit of a cure. Diabetes Australia played an important role in alerting people to the disease last Friday, World Diabetes Day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reports from the recent International Diabetes Federation Congress in Finland estimate that 132 million people now have diabetes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10446"> worldwide and that this will increase by 240 million by the year 2010. In 1990 diabetes was ranked 16th in global causes of death but now rates as the fifth major cause of death as it reaches epidemic proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Diabetes Australia, the rate of diabetes in Australia's overall population is following global high trends, and urban Aborigines have the fourth highest rate in the world. Migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds are also at high risk of developing diabetes due to changes in their lifestyles. Non-insulin dependent diabetes is a disease that is often triggered by lifestyle factors, such as unhealthy eating and low levels of activity. This is different from insulin dependent diabetes, which is not caused by lifestyle. As countries develop economically, eating habits tend to change to include more high fat foods, and activity often decreases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that people realise what they can do to avoid diseases like non-insulin dependent diabetes through healthy eating plans and regular exercise. For people who already have the disease, the aim is to educate them so they can maintain good diabetes management. It is now clear that good control of diabetes can reduce the development of complications, such as blindness, kidney disease, heart attack, stroke, limb amputation and impotence. All people with diabetes should have a healthy eating plan, exercise regularly, test glucose levels daily and seek regular medical check-ups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Non-insulin dependent diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, affecting 85 per cent of those with the disease. People most at risk of developing it are over 40, overweight, have a family history of diabetes, have high blood pressure and, if female, have given birth to babies weighing over four kilograms. As a group, because of our lifestyle, we as members of parliament are among the high risk categories of diabetes. At the moment there is no cure for diabetes, but there is excellent treatment available. Although diabetes cannot be cured by insulin or tablets, it can be managed with help and advice by doctors and other health workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having diabetes is no sentence to inactivity. People can maintain a normal lifestyle provid 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed they watch their weight and exercise regularly. Australian governments, both state and federal, have recognised the seriousness of diabetes in that at the meeting in July 1996 Australian health ministers agreed to include diabetes as a fifth national health priority area. This has lifted the public profile of diabetes and paves the way for the implementation of some national strategies of real value to address the prevention, early diagnosis and control and management of diabetes in Australia. It should also result in an unprecedented level of cooperation between governments and diabetes organisations such as the International Diabetes Institute, Diabetes Australia and other non-government groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In December 1996 the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Diabetes was established to provide high level, independent, expert advice to the Commonwealth on all issues relating to the development and implementation of a national diabetes strategy. Funding of $7.7 million over three years was allocated in the 1996-97 budget to implement a national diabetes strategy, first announced in the `Health throughout life' policy document. The strategy has the objective of reducing the incidence, prevalence and impact of complications of diabetes in Australia, and the social, economic and health costs of this disease to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are considerable costs, both direct and indirect, in regard to diabetes in Australia. The cost of the illness to people's quality of life is immeasurable. It has been estimated that one in every seven of our health dollars is spent on either diabetes or its complications. There are large in&hyphen;patient costs, something like $280 million, and nursing home costs, something like $94 million, associated with diabetes in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The largest contributor by far to the annual in&hyphen;patient cost of diabetes is vascular disease, which costs at least $111 million per year. Pharmaceutical treatments such as insulin or oral tablets and physician visits cost about $70 million and $90 million respectively per year. Production loss from premature mortality is estimated at $377 million annually, based on average earnings and life years lost to age 75.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10447">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real cost is very difficult to accurately state as so many people who have the disease or have non&hyphen;insulin dependent diabetes are unaware of it and the illnesses they have. Time lost through work is often put down to some other cause. I must say that the current Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has played a very active role in raising the awareness of diabetes. I know, from the many press statements he has put out and the commitment he has to that field, he is determined that the education of Australians will be raised in regard to diabetes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the government to continue funding research into diabetes and the national diabetes strategy. It is essential that a widespread education campaign be promoted to alert the population to the risks of developing the disease. I commend Diabetes Australia for the work they do, the important role they play and, indeed, the activities that they arranged last Friday&mdash;World Diabetes Day. The ultimate goal must be for a cure for diabetes, but research must continue in areas which may improve quality of life for people with diabetes.</PARA>

I am pleased to support this motion moved by the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) relating to diabetes. I just note at the outset that we are debating diabetes mellitus, not diabetes insipidus which relates to a lack of a hormone, vasopressin, released by the pituitary gland which controls fluid released from the kidneys as urine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of diabetes mellitus, which we are debating, is best understood by examining its effects on the human body. The body is unable to properly use its main fuel, glucose, which then builds up in the bloodstream causing hyperglycaemia. Normally, when levels rise insulin is released from the pancreas which lowers the levels by enhancing the transport of glucose across the cell wall, allowing it to be utilised in the muscles as energy or the excess of it to be stored as glycogen in the liver or, by a more complicated mechanism, the storage of fat in adipose tissue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if it is allowed to build up in the blood instead of going into the muscles and liver, in classic form it spills out through the kidneys via excessive urination, leading of course to excessive thirst. The person so affected has a lack of energy and a loss of weight. If the muscles cannot access glucose, the liver often releases ketones to supply the deficient energy and this can lead to acidity problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many reasons for low insulin output. Insulin is produced by the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. A deficiency of these cells will mean a deficiency of insulin, and this is what is classically seen with juvenile diabetes. There may also be a delayed or insufficient release of insulin, which is commonly seen with adult diabetes. There are also other more minor and complicated areas such as chemical inactivators in the blood preventing insulin from carrying out its full role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Persistent high glucose levels in the bloodstream can be very damaging over a period of time, particularly on body organs. It can cause renal failure and vascular damage. It can cause arteriosclerosis of the large vessels. If that happens in the brain you have a stroke; if it happens in the heart you have a heart attack, such as a coronary heart attack; in the kidneys it causes renal damage, as I have mentioned, or in the extremities of the body such as the limbs and feet it can cause ulcers and gangrene, ultimately leading to amputation in the most extreme forms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can also have thickening of the walls, arterioles and capillaries to each organ. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10448"> most tragic, perhaps, is thickening of the retinal blood vessels in the eyes, which can lead to blindness. This is particularly tragic because it is easily preventable, as is damage to kidneys, muscles and skin. Hyperglycaemia, in a persistent form, can affect peripheral nerves leading to a loss of skin sensitivity in some areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most susceptible groups are those with a family history of it and those who are overweight. Sometimes it is picked up in pregnant women, particularly if they give birth to babies in excess of four kilograms. It often means you have a lot of glucose floating around in your bloodstream to nourish your foetus to that weight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The juvenile form affects about 70,000 people in this country, usually children under 15, though it may affect young adults. These are invariably insulin dependent. The onset is often sudden; they just do not produce enough insulin and the blood glucose levels of these victims must be monitored very closely indeed. They often have to have injections of insulin, at least one and up to several injections a day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Adult, or mature onset, diabetes, which usually occurs in the over&hyphen;40-year-olds is often slow in onset. Some of those need insulin. The great bulk of them&mdash;80 to 90 per cent or more&mdash;are non-insulin dependent and they often respond best to oral hypoglycaemic drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that everybody with diabetes needs a lifestyle audit. Each individual is different and must be treated and assessed differently. Diets must be adjusted for the number of calories and how those are derived from carbohydrates, fats and proteins. A moderate exercise program should at least be determined because exercise utilises carbohydrates and reduces the need for insulin. But particularly important is early diagnosis. If we are going to prevent the damage that is done from chronic diabetes, which is a very insidious disease indeed, the importance of early diagnosis cannot be overstressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A total of 430,000 people&mdash;2.4 per cent of the population&mdash;are diagnosed with diabetes in Australia now, but up to 700,000 or 800,000 may have it and not realise it. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the sixth major cause of death from disease in Australia and the United States. There are 110 million people with it worldwide. That is estimated to double over the next 10 or 15 years. It is very worth while spending time assessing people with high glucose levels, working out diet and exercise and giving them an understanding and steering them in the direction of peer support groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must educate doctors in this country, remarkable as that may sound at first, as well as educating the general population, particularly the target groups that are susceptible to diabetes. I believe that we cannot spend too much money on prevention of this disease that is costing the community in excess of $1,000 million a year in nursing home fees, vascular disease treatment, drugs, doctors' expenses and premature mortality, not to mention the incalculable private cost to individuals and families that are afflicted with this disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only 0.1 per cent of the population under 15 may be affected but that rises rapidly to five to six per cent or more over the age of 45 and up to 8.9 per cent in Australia over the age of 75. Aborigines are particularly prone to diabetes. One study revealed a 16.7 per cent incidence in the Bourke&hyphen;Enngonia area in my electorate. It is interesting that Aborigines have a very low incidence of juvenile diabetes, even though they have a high incidence of the adult form, probably due to a lower exercise status than they used to have before non-Aboriginal people arrived in this country and a constant diet high in sugar. Obviously, alcohol may also have an effect on the pancreas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very pleased that last year the budget allocated $7.7 million over three years to implement a national diabetes strategy to reduce the incidence, prevalence, impact and cost of diabetes. That program was linked in with Diabetes Australia, an excellent organisation, as well as the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Diabetes, MACOD, that the previous speaker mentioned, which was an initiative set up in December last year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is definitely a pleasure to have the opportunity to second the motion proposed by my colleague the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) today. In doing so, I preface my comments by saying that much of the finer detail and the statistical information relating to diabetes has already been referred to by the two previous speakers, the members for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and Throsby. I do not want to go on and repeat too much of that, but I think some of the points need to be reiterated, considering the severity of the disease in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Diabetes is definitely far too common in our community and it has too severe an impact on the lives of the sufferers of this condition to allow it to go unattended. I am not suggesting for a moment that it is, but we need to put into perspective what we are doing and what we need to do in the future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the motion says&mdash;it is hard when I read these statistics to actually understand the enormity of it&mdash;approximately every 12 minutes somewhere somebody is receiving a diagnosis of diabetes in this country. That is quite an extraordinary statistic to reflect upon. There are several approaches that are needed when we talk about trying to address the impact of diabetes on the individual and the community. But we also need to look at what we are actually talking about when we refer to the question of diabetes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said, an estimated 800,000 people are affected one way or the other with diabetes in this country. There are two types of diabetes in lay person's terms. Type 1, the juvenile type, is a very sudden onset form of diabetes. I think it is correct to say that it is always insulin dependent. It is very rare that it is not. That is in the minority of the cases, although enormous in numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ninety per cent of the sufferers of diabetes in this country actually fall into the type 2 category. They are not always necessarily insulin dependent. This diabetes occurs in the older age group. Whilst not necessarily being insulin dependent, it can be and is much more insidious in how it can affect the individual. The complications can be devastating&mdash;and those complications occur in both insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent diabetes. Those sorts of complications can include, as has been said: blindness; kidney disease; heart disease; stroke; limb amputation; and, in some men, impotence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to hear the member for Parkes, the previous speaker, refer to the situation of diabetes in our indigenous people and the high incidence of diabetes that can occur in that community. I am a member of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. That committee has only just begun an inquiry into indigenous health in this country. I know that over the next few months as we travel the country&mdash;and I know they will be very remote places in some cases&mdash;I am going to learn a lot more about diabetes within our indigenous community. I am hopeful that that inquiry may be able to shed a bit more light in that area should that be needed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10450">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about the requirement for research, research dollars are always very hard to get at what we would consider an adequate level. But, no matter where the government comes from in political terms, I think what we really have to do is grasp the nettle and say to ourselves, `When we look at the dollars going into research, let's also look at the cost of the disease or the disorder that we are researching as well. Let's look at what it will really cost our community if we do not address these issues at the level of research adequate.' If we sometimes think about that a lot more carefully, we may find it in ourselves possible to get that extra dollar for that research when we look at the cost.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent news in diabetes, the NHMRC and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation have joined in what could be a new model for research funding&mdash;a government body and a not-for-profit organisation actually collaborating to deliver research funding.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, on World Diabetes Day, last Friday, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) announced that Professor Kevin Lafferty of the John Curtin School will receive $530,000 a year to study cellular processes in the development of insulin dependent diabetes, and that Dr Grant Morahan of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute will receive $470,000 to undertake genetic studies of insulin dependent diabetes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Paul Zimmit and John Carter's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> in July this year, a number of the improvements in public policy that we have seen in diabetes since this government was elected were highlighted. In particular, they also talked about some of the advances in diabetes. In 1993, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New England Journal of Medicine</EMPHASIS> published a trial which showed that excellent control of blood sugar levels in people with non-insulin dependent diabetes reduced the risk of microvascular complications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Scandinavia, a trial has shown that the use of Simvastatin in diabetics who have had one heart attack reduces the risk of a future heart attack by 55 per cent. In the area of end stage renal failure, which is a particular problem for people with diabetes, the use of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10451"> ACE inhibitors, such as things like Captopril, can delay the onset of end stage renal failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of having a national diabetes strategy is to see that these sorts of advancements in research are actually delivered out there to medical practitioners and diabetes educators. The national diabetes strategy, which is going to be managed by Diabetes Australia, should improve the treatment and education of those with diabetes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday was World Diabetes Day. It is worth recognising the emphasis this government has placed on diabetes by making it one of the five national health  priorities&mdash;with insulin dependent diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes and gestational diabetes all being targeted. The number of Australians with diabetes is rising. Any preventative health program must target, as the national diabetes strategy is targeting, those from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background, those from a non-English speaking background, women who have a history of gestational diabetes, the elderly and those with obesity, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, the 1993 diabetes action plan for adult onset diabetes was funded by a drug company and had minimal success. Last year's budget allocated $7.6 million for the development of a national non-insulin dependent diabetes action plan. That will be directed to research, targeting high risk groups, education, care and prevention. It will also include things like funding to the National Association of Diabetes Centres Consortium and the Australian Diabetes Educators Association, which will improve coordination of education and care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The divisions of general practice will also have an increasing role in coordinating diabetes care. After years of not knowing how many Australians have diabetes, we now have a national diabetes register for diabetics who are treated with insulin.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister explain to the House why he performed his latest backflip on nursing homes without taking the matter to the cabinet, and why the departmental officials employed to administer the new policy only learned the details of it by sitting in front of a TV with a notepad while he appeared on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> ? Prime Minister, why is it that your government seems to spend more time trying to censor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> funeral orations and tearing down bus shelters than it does thinking about providing a decent nursing homes policy for elderly Australians that will not cost them their homes?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A decent nursing home policy for retired Australians includes a number of elements. The first of those elements is a very, very significant ongoing contribution from the general body of taxpayers. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that, even making allowance for the contribution of people who will be required to meet the new annual accommodation charges, something in the order of 70 per cent&mdash;I repeat, 70 per cent&mdash;of the entire cost of maintaining such a person in a nursing home will be met out of the general pool of taxpayers' funds. The second observation I would make is that any decent nursing home policy requires that the quality of nursing homes be such that the elderly of Australia can live there in dignity and comfort. That is something that the Labor Party ruthlessly ignored because, in the remaining years that the Labor Party was in office, you ruthlessly and cynically and deliberately, and with no care at all for the welfare of elderly Australians, ran down that capital contribution. The third element of a decent nursing home policy is that it is fair for the rest of the community to ask of those and the families of those who are going into nursing homes that, if they can afford to do so, they make a contribution towards the care of their relatives in nursing homes. They are the three elements of a decent nursing home policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think those who are interested in the state of nursing homes are entitled to ask of both sides of politics which side is the more serious in delivering that policy. All the Labor Party has done is to deliberately scare the elderly of Australia. You have run around the Australian community, deliberately trying to scare elderly people. You know as well as we do the age demographics of the Australian population. You know that we can no longer afford to ignore, any of us&mdash;and I address that to all members opposite and to all those behind me&mdash;the ageing character of the Australian population. In the long run, a responsible government puts in place a policy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10456"> that will get more capital into nursing homes. They will do it in a way that is fair and balanced and just. They will do it in the teeth of unfair, unfounded criticism and opposition&mdash;and that is what we have done. When the Minister for Family Services speaks on this matter later this week, the Australian public will know that it has a government that has a detailed, comprehensive, long&hyphen;term nursing home policy that will give security and comfort to the elderly, will give them comfort and dignity but will, at the same time, ensure that there are proper capital contributions to the nursing home stock of this country.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I looked around for comment about Telstra, by far the most memorable, by far the most penetrating and by far the most relevant comment that has been made about Telstra in the last 48 hours was made not by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; it was made by the Leader of the Opposition. This is what he had to say on 4QR radio this morning: `I'm sad that the Telstra float has gone ahead.' Doesn't that just encapsulate the miserable negativity of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is sad that 600,000 Australians for the first time have bought shares on the Australian Stock Exchange. The Leader of the Opposition is sad that Telstra is now owned, as to 81 per cent of its shares, by Australians. The Leader of the Opposition is sad that the Australian taxpayer has got $14.2 billion for the sale of one-third of Telstra. The Leader of the Opposition is sad that, having left us with a budget deficit of $10.5 billion, we are actually cleaning up the mess he left behind. The Leader of the Opposition is apparently 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sad that four per cent of the shares in the float have gone to the employees of Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is another magnificent example of my government having not only delivered in full but having over&hyphen;delivered on a mainstream election commitment. We promised the Australian people that we would sell one third of Telstra. This development is a milestone in the economic history of Australia. The sale of Telstra has underlined the fundamental sense of hope and optimism of the Australian people. It is a great investment by the mums and dads in the ownership of a great Australian enterprise. Well may those on the opposite side be glum about this. Almost two million Australians now own shares in Telstra. It is a magnificent demonstration of the willingness of mainstream Australia to invest their money in great Australian companies. And what is the attitude of those who sit opposite? It is negative, nitpicking, sad sack opposition to the successful float of a great Australian enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well may the Leader of the Opposition be sad. This has been a triumphant success, underlining the hope and optimism of the Australian people. It is a wonderful vindication of the policy that we took to the last election. We promised to sell a third. We have sold a third. We promised majority Australian ownership. We have 81 per cent Australian ownership. We promised that we would invest $1.2 billion out of the proceeds of the sale in the re-invigoration of the natural heritage of this country. And what do we get from the Opposition Leader? He is sad. He is sad about such goods news for Australia. Many Australians will be sad that the Leader of the Opposition is so demonstrably out of touch with the sentiment and the emotions of mainstream Australia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<ANSWER PAGE="10457" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question. I know that the honourable gentleman, as have many members on both sides of the House, let it be admitted, has taken a very keen interest in this issue. I am particularly proud of the work that my government, my Foreign Minister and others have done in dealing with the issue of landmines. I would remind the House that this government took the initiative on 15 April last year, shortly after coming to office, of committing Australia to a global ban on antipersonnel landmines. We then suspended indefinitely their operational use by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian Defence Force. I am now particularly pleased to inform the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will sign the Ottawa treaty on behalf of Australia when it opens for signature on 3 and 4 December. I thank him and the Minister for Defence and others who have been involved in the process of the formulation of the government's policy on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The treaty, the full title of which is the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Antipersonnel Mines and on their Destruction, will mean that Australia will forswear the use of antipersonnel landmines and destroy its own stockpile of those landmines. The treaty allows only a small number of mines to be retained for development and training in mine detection, clearance and destruction techniques. The government is very disappointed that, despite the likely signature by over 100 countries, the major producers and exporters of landmines are not prepared at this stage to sign the treaty. We will work very hard now in other forums, notably at the Conference on Disarmament, to ensure that the norm established by the Ottawa treaty becomes universal and includes these producers and exporters. The government will also continue its strong support for de-mining and assistance to the victims of landmines. Since May of 1996 this government has committed over $19 million to de-mining operations in Cambodia, Laos, Angola, Mozambique and Afghanistan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do acknowledge, as anybody who understands this acknowledges, that this decision does create some difficulty for the Australian Defence Force. Australia has never been associated with the irresponsible use of landmines but they have played an important part in plans for the defence of Australia. I emphasise in that context that we will be focusing very much on finding and developing an alternative to them, and developing that alternative will now be essential in the overall defence structure of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision I have announced today that we will sign the Ottawa treaty will be widely welcomed throughout the Australian community. It is the humanitarian right way to go. The scourge of landmines, the devastation that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10458"> they wreak physically, emotionally and in so many other respects on their helpless victims, is a poignant reminder of the brutality of man to man. I think the decision we have taken is the right one, and quite properly deserves the applause and support of the Australian community.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. I acknowledge the fine work that he is doing as chairman of that committee and the way in which the committee is performing. It was one of this government's changes in relation to monetary policy&mdash;our determination to make the conduct of monetary policy more transparent and to set out an inflation objective&mdash;that has brought such benefits in relation to interest rates. When this government was elected the difference between the 10&hyphen;year bond rate in the US and the 10&hyphen;year bond rate in Australia was 250 basis points. As a result of changes that we have put in place, they are almost the same, trading at maybe a margin of 10 or 15 points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that the Governor of the Reserve Bank was making was that prudent economic managers will always ensure that they have at least a small margin&mdash;hopefully a big one&mdash;in order to weather external shocks. We have witnessed enormous volatility on world stock markets, we have seen enormous volatility on South&hyphen;East Asian currency markets, and that has affected Australia to some degree, but the one thing we can say is that this government's prudent course to fix Australia's financial position bought Australia a level of comfort which it needed for an external shock like this. And we can say this: if the wanton irresponsibility of Labor mismanagement had continued, Australia would not be in the position that it is now. We now have the lowest level of inflation in Australia since the 1960s. We have the lowest home mortgage rates since man walked on the moon&mdash;since 1969. We have a budget which will go back into surplus next year. At the same time, this year Australia will not borrow and next year Australia will not borrow. This year Australia will be repaying debt. And that is a long way away from Labor's plan, which was to try to make Australia a debtor nation. Whenever you hear the Australian Labor Party up here, it is always the same: tax and spend, run up deficits, run up debt, run up interest rates.

When the product of the banks is made available to the consumer market, the relevant rates that pertain to the relevant streaming of the funds to the accommodation charge will be made and it will be paid against that person's estate. There may well be, as there are in other countries, a range of products offered by a range of institutions with different arrangements.

In thrashing around for some kind of alternative visage, what the Labor Party have done is to stumble upon philosophies and attitudes of the coalition, just as they have seen their Labor counterpart in the UK embrace the philosophies of their predecessor.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Cook for his question. What distinguishes this government from those on the other side of the House is that the government has been prepared to put in the hard yards in economic policy to lay the foundations for sustained job growth in Australia. Members of the Australian community have been heartened in recent months by a number of signs that job growth is now well and truly getting under way. In the last couple of months, we have had some 75,000 new jobs coming through, and there are some very good indicators that suggest that this job growth, while it will undoubtedly fluctuate from month to month, is very likely to come through in very good numbers over the next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The retail trade figures showed a 3.1 per cent increase in September, the largest quarterly rise since the series began. The skilled vacancy survey showed a 3.9 per cent rise in October, the strongest rise in almost three 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years. The latest Morgan and Banks survey shows a two&hyphen;year record in the proportion of companies seeking to increase their staff. The government is also putting in place major reforms to help long&hyphen;term unemployed people get jobs by paying job placement agencies when a job has actually been obtained. I am aware that there are alternative proposals around to create jobs, and a document has come into my hands called `Economic first principles: wellbeing, jobs and growth', which I understand is the draft jobs platform from the Australian Labor Party. What this document shows is that the Australian Labor Party has learnt nothing. This is a prescription for job destruction, because it is a prescription for higher spending, higher taxes and a return to Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the first things that strikes you when you read this prescription for jobs is that there is absolutely no reference in this document to small business&mdash;the major engine of job growth in this country. There is no reference at all to small business. There are, however, messages in here which small business in this country will read too clearly between the lines of. The first thing that strikes you is that there is a determination to restore the powers to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to restore the powers to unions to enter the workplace and to expand the right of trade union officials to interfere in small business. In other words, once again what we have here is the relentlessly sectional policies of the Labor Party. Its concern in clause after clause is the promotion of union power against small business. Not every member of the Labor front bench believes that this is that way to go. The member for Werriwa has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The union movement already exercises tremendous power in the ALP, mainly through its support for the ruling faction in each state branch.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the same document he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This decade the ALP will be forced to confront the fading relevance of its trade union affiliates.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was absolutely right on that point. But he has not got the message through to the member for Batman. The member for Batman is, of course, the spokesman for trade union power, and that is clearly reflected in this draft policy, which would destroy jobs and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10463"> reinforce the policies of unfair dismissals which have destroyed jobs in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other key feature of this policy is that it is going to restore the short&hyphen;term training programs of Working Nation&mdash;the $10 billion failed program of the Labor Party. There is no commitment in here to programs to help long&hyphen;term unemployed people by rewarding agencies for actually placing them in jobs, there is no commitment in here to the apprenticeship reforms of the government and there is no commitment in here to quality training; there is simply a commitment to the same old policies which led to the lowest number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships for three decades. This document reveals, once again, that the Labor Party is a policy free zone when it comes to employment. It has absolutely no credibility at all in creating jobs. It is a policy for more regulation, bigger spending, higher deficits and higher taxes&mdash;and that is a policy for job destruction.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

It is in direct, flagrant defiance of a United Nations Security Council resolution, it is in defiance of the rule of international law, and it is in defiance of the wishes of the international community. The Australian government regards Iraq's behaviour as unacceptable. Australia, like the rest of the international community, is seriously concerned about Iraq's refusal to renounce its capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction. UNSCOM's latest report set out compelling concerns about Iraq's chemical and biological weapons program. The possibility that Iraq retains or persists in wanting to develop these horrific weapons of mass destruction poses a threat to peace in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East and a direct threat to international security, and it must be stopped.</PARA></TALK.START>

If it is indulged in any way, it will undermine the role of the Security Council. That, in turn, will have enormous consequences for the rule of international law and for international security. There is therefore no alternative to full and immediate compliance by Iraq, without any restrictions or conditions, with the resolutions of the Security Council. In causing this crisis, President Saddam Hussein has yet again demonstrated his contempt for the international community and his disregard for the suffering of the Iraqi people as a result of his complete refusal to comply with the United Nations Security Council resolutions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The facts of the legislation are, as I have always said, that the government announced in the budget that it would ensure that its legislation dealt with trafficking in trusts. Do you know what trafficking in trusts is? Trafficking in trusts is trafficking trusts to people outside the family or those who are presently entitled. That was the object of the legislation. The legislation that was produced was defective in two respects. First, as I said before, you were unable where you traded through trusts to set trust loss off against trust income where you had the same entitled beneficiaries, so that if you were an individual and you had income you were able to access the loss, but if you were an individual in a trust which had a loss you were unable to set it off against income which would come from your presently entitled trust. Nothing was clearer than that when the government engaged in consultation with the small business community. If you happened to have, as I said before, one trust which owned the property and another that conducted the business, you would be unable to set off losses against income.</PARA></TALK.START>

The legislation provided that if the beneficiaries of the two trusts were the family, whether the loss was made by the beneficiary or whether it was made through the trust you could set off the loss and the income. Enabling companies to do that had one effect. The corresponding effect was to cut down the number of family members that could be under the definition of `family'.

It is timely, given all that has been happening in Asia in October 1997 in particular, because a good outcome on liberalisation is in many ways the best response to the currency crisis that has hit some APEC members. The government will be pushing for sensible trade liberalisation&mdash;win&hyphen;win, job creation trade liberalisation. We will be doing so on a range of fronts involving the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and me. The first is through the individual action plans.

Being a careful inspectorial leader, I look at all of these interviews. I thought it was a very good interview.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure the Australian public that the measures that I will announce on Thursday and the statement I will be making on Thursday will put into proper context again the stance that my government has taken, the success that we have achieved over the past few months, the way in which the position of the Americans has become more accommodating to Australia, the way in which the essentially self&hyphen;serving position of some of the European countries has been exposed, the extent to which the Japanese have become more understanding of our position and the way in which the Australian government, originally derided by those who sit opposite as being a lonely, isolated government on this issue, over the past few months has very successfully been able to bring influence to bear around the community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Forde for her question. It is a matter that concerns all Australians. We know from the Australian Bureau of Statistics women's safety survey that 23 per cent of women&mdash;almost one in every four&mdash;who have ever been married or in a de facto relationship have experienced physical or sexual violence at some time during that relationship. We are concerned about the safety of these women. We are particularly concerned about the effects on children of witnessing these violent episodes. This has a profound effect on children and also promotes or creates a cycle of violence. Despite governments in Australia spending around $226 million a year on dealing directly with domestic violence, we still have a very major problem in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The united stand of all heads of government at the  national summit on 7 November in condemning domestic violence sent a very powerful message to the community that domestic violence has to stop. Their commitment to work together in partnerships against domestic violence, a new initiative for testing new approaches to prevention of violence and the breaking of the cycle, will be underpinned by the Commonwealth spending a further $25 million on trying to break this cycle and prevent domestic violence. This is a down payment. We need to explore new ways of dealing with this problem and look at measures that work so that we can be better informed as to where our priorities lie in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very significant outcome of the summit was the unanimous agreement by all heads of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10469"> government to release for public discussion a model domestic violence law. This will ensure that there is continuity of law for victims across this country. To strengthen the initiative, the Prime Minister launched Business Against Domestic Violence on 12 November. This was co-chaired by Robert Champion de Crespigny of Normandy Mining and Paula Gerber of the law firm Maddock Lonie and Chisholm. Business Against Domestic Violence has been given a tax exemption status. It is a great opportunity for corporate Australia to invest in the prevention of domestic violence. Business can reach audiences that governments cannot. It can influence attitudes of employees and it can develop support programs for staff who are affected by domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community groups have welcomed this initiative and the move to include all sections of the community in addressing the problem of domestic violence in our country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because this is the first occasion since the parliament has met since some of the more extravagant and careless remarks in this debate have been made, I take the opportunity of repudiating on behalf of me and all of my colleagues the quite unfounded and dishonest racial motives that have been attributed to the government in this matter. I think some of the remarks that have been made in this debate have done far more damage to those who have made the remarks than those against whom the remarks have been directed. I think the real context of this debate was illustrated last week with what I might now say&mdash;and I never thought I would ever say it of him&mdash;was the timely intervention of my predecessor, the former Labor Prime Minister, Paul Keating. That intervention really brought forth some very interesting comment and, juxtaposed with the remarks of Graham Richardson, threw some very interesting light on this whole debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, as everybody knows, the whole basis of the 1993 Native Title Act was the unconditional representation by the former Prime Minister to the Australian community, particularly to the farmers of Australia, that the grant of a pastoral lease had extinguished native title. It was not in any way if, perhaps or maybe but an unconditional representation to the Australian community&mdash;no ifs or buts, no qualifications. Paul Keating on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> on 19 October 1993 had this to say:</PARA>

What they regarded as the law then we are not intending to give effect to by our legislation now before the Senate. What our legislation does is to confirm the principles laid down in the Wik decision. Our legislation does not, as some people over the weekend have suggested, in any way disturb the Mabo decision.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I rule out the possibility in Queensland of people pursuing any rights in relation to pastoral leases owned by non&hyphen;Aboriginal people.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me make it absolutely clear that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) attempted to slip&hyphen;slide from one point to another. He started off by a discussion of the notion of active extinguishment, which applied in fact only to the post&hyphen;1975 leases, where there was a clear&hyphen;cut problem established. In the preamble there is an iteration&mdash;not related, I might say, to pastoral leases but to leaseholding generally&mdash;based on the government's assumption at the time of the meaning of the Mabo judgment, that in leasehold areas, unless otherwise specifically provided for, native title had been extinguished. It was not an active measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, if he wants recourse to the comments and quotes of the time, I suggest he reads the speech of the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and I suggest he reads the motions moved in the Senate by National Party senators who sought to convert that iteration into an explicit extinguishment. That was what they sought to do. That was refused by the government at the time. That was resisted, because the government at the time&mdash;while making that assumption in good faith and based on the legal advice that it had, that it knew the miners had and that it knew 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10474"> the pastoralists had&mdash;knew that that was the case. But it also knew it was being tested in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the government to have gone down that road at that time would have placed this country in precisely the position it is now. Had we gone down that road, we would have placed ourselves in the position where billions of dollars of taxpayers funds were at risk, and an issue that could be settled by sensible negotiation would have been taken off the table in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Prime Minister, the way in which you tried to slip around this issue, suggesting that there was some form of active extinguishment then going on instead of the iteration of an understood legal position, does you no credit. But it also casts in our minds a severe doubt as to the intentions of your legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister wants to know what we think of his legislation. We think it discriminatory&mdash;and we think it discriminatory on racial grounds.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Deputy Speaker, when you hear the term `rural women', I would not be surprised if you, like so many, believe that the definition of rural women is `women who live and work on farms'. But that definition is far too narrow and ignores the fact that more than 2&half; million women live outside metropolitan areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While increasing numbers of these women are the principals of farming enterprises and small businesses, they are also teachers, nurses, librarians, policewomen, and workers in factories, newsagents, supermarkets, et cetera. Their work is the linchpin that provides cohesion in all our rural communities. Their work contributes to the national economy, both directly through their paid employment and indirectly through their unpaid employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The diversity of rural women's work is increasing each year as more women become involved in a range of activities from the innovative conceptual stage through to production and post&hyphen;production marketing&mdash;and not just responding to domestic and international demands for products and services, but initiating and developing niche markets in, for example, cheese products, wool and alpaca garments, flowers, herbs, fruit and timber products, and value adding to meat and poultry, to name but a few. Farm tourism is now a thriving rural industry, thanks to the organisation, development and marketing skills of rural women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the majority of rural women, like their metropolitan counterparts, are employed in the services sector, the number of women in the rural work force has doubled in the past 15 years. Women now comprise 32 per cent of all agricultural workers. Also, we now have 71,400 women who are farmers or farm managers, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Farm Journal</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are able to know these facts because it is relatively easy to identify women in the paid work force data. It is, however, almost impossible to measure the total contribution rural women make to both the national and local economies, because we have no accurate means of measuring their real contribution. This is because our census data collection is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10478"> grossly inadequate and, even today, follows the trend set back in 1893, when it was officially decided to exclude women's involvement in both agriculture and mining from the census.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The census fails to accurately record the extent of rural women's work on two counts: it fails to identify rural women as a group and fails to ask questions relevant to the working lifestyles of rural women. Currently, the census asks whether unpaid work is carried out in a family business. The 1991 census data revealed that 16,000 females described themselves as unpaid helpers in rural areas, but we have no clear understanding of the type or amount of work that unpaid rural helpers performed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the problem is far greater than not understanding the true contribution of those identified 16,000 unpaid helpers. Many women do not regard being solely responsible for the general administration of the family business, whether that be a farm or a sports store, as work. We know that the vast majority of rural small businesses have women in these roles. This is not just from anecdotal evidence. A national forum on women in agriculture and resource management this year found that women generally take full responsibility for the farm book work, plus banking sources tell us that 80 per cent of cheques from farm businesses are signed by women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Added to this reluctance by women to regard this sort of activity as work, there is the problem of women who work off- farm&mdash;often, for example, for eight hours a day and then come home and update the computer records, et cetera. These women provide 68 per cent of all farm cash income. Sue Kilpatrick, a researcher from the University of Tasmania, has demonstrated that the increasing education levels of women and keeping up with the latest information through training make a significant difference to the profit of family businesses. Much of the work that ensures that rural small businesses survive is performed by women who regard that work not as traditional employment but as an extension of their role as wife and mother. This means that so much of the valuable work, not just in administration but in devel 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> oping new ideas and products by rural women, remains invisible because there is simply no appropriate means of recording it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why this appalling lack of information and, therefore, recognition has remained for so long is that our definition of work has traditionally been linked to the payment of a wage. It is time that we re-assessed that definition because, by maintaining that strict definition, we are doing rural women a grave injustice and we are not providing an accurate assessment of the type and amount of work that contributes significantly to our national economy. Surely it is time that we designed questions in the census addressed specifically to those two and a half million rural women that would allow and encourage them to accurately record their real working contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is this economic data seriously lacking but so too is the data on the amount of voluntary work performed by rural women. This work is absolutely vital in maintaining the infrastructure of rural communities. Community involvement has long been the hallmark of rural communities in local schools, hospitals, libraries, the Red Cross, and sporting and service clubs. We should remember that it is because of work done by the CWA and other rural women's groups that women are now admitted to all areas of education and employment. The network of these groups and, increasingly, agri-business and agri-political groups weave the fabric of rural community life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, there are still many women in rural areas who do not count their voluntary work as work. I once asked a woman what type of work she was involved in, only to be told that she didn't work. However, it later emerged that a typical day for her was starting early to do the local voluntary bus run to school and then she worked at the local school as a voluntary helper with reading, music and tuckshop. Each afternoon she helped at the hospital, library, or nursing home, was a Girl Guides leader, assisted in the canteen for her son's footy team, gave lifesaving instruction at the local pool, did the flowers at the local church and was a member of several local 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10479"> community groups. And she did not believe that she worked!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While some of rural women's outstanding work is recognised at the local level, limited recognition at the national level does not reflect the depth and breadth of the impact of their voluntary work. We need to get a much clearer picture. I stress that I am not advocating the collection of this data merely for the sake of it. It is my hope that this will encourage more rural women to recognise their own contribution and will enable both government and industry to be aware of their significant contribution, both directly and indirectly, to the national economy. I call on the government to refer these proposed changes to the Australian Bureau of Statistics in order to bring about these much needed changes to recognise the invaluable work of rural women throughout our nation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have taken the opportunity to join this discussion on the motion moved by the member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) to commend the member for the points she has made arising out of the census.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come at this question not without some experience. I had great pleasure earlier this year in not only conducting the Victorian launch of the wonderful publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The many hats of country women</EMPHASIS>, which is a history of the CWA written by Brenda Stevens-Chambers, but also co&hyphen;launching the book on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that day with Jean Tom, the former president of the CWA&mdash;one of the mothers of the CWA movement. At that gathering we had reason to talk about the number of times, in my experience in the last 13 years, rural women have been very strong in coming forward and raising issues that many of us were unaware of, putting the case on the table and making government listen and respond. It is to the great credit of organisations like the CWA and the many other active rural women's groups&mdash;not only farm women, as Mrs Bailey has mentioned, but also the many other women in these groups&mdash;that they have made us look and listen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we in this parliament develop our policies, I call on the member for McEwen to be sure that she does not participate in what I call the `hoax'. It is not sufficient to stand up here and mouth platitudes about what a wonderful contribution different people make if in fact you are participating in policy decisions that make things even tougher for those very people you are talking about. I would like to give a couple of examples of what I am talking about here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all seen publicity in recent months about the number of farm families who miss out on various components of the social security aid budget, be they payments under the former farm household support scheme, Austudy or whatever, because they have been unaware of their entitlement or, more importantly, because so much rhetoric has come from people who criticise various government programs that they have felt that it is too hard to apply, all too complex or that it is not moral or right to take handouts or benefits. I say this particularly to those members who now find themselves in government and who many times criticised former programs that were there particularly to assist issues that rural women had brought to our attention. I draw your attention to the sense of obligation there; it is not appropriate to go around bagging these programs as `welfare', `Labor budget breakers' or those sorts of things that you do in your political rhetoric when you are creating a mind&hyphen;set that may mean that people do not even apply for benefits that they should be applying for.</PARA>

I would also like to share with the House the high standard of contribution of rural women in my own electorate of Dawson, which I have no doubt is reflective of many other electorates with rural constituencies. Their stories are similar in that they represent a deep seated commitment to not only their families but also to the development and fostering of the land which supports them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would firstly like to speak of Mrs Rita Neilsen, of Septimus, west of Mackay, who was a regional finalist in this year's ABC Rural Woman of the Year award. Rita has been heavily involved in the sugar industry for much of her life; indeed, she is a fifth generation farmer. The pride she expresses for both the land and the industry as a whole is evidenced in her strength of commitment. Not only did Rita raise a family while struggling against the drought that affected the Pioneer Valley in the 1980s, she played an instrumental role in the formation of the Canegrowers Network, a local organisation of farmers and canegrowing women who came together to address the social consequences following the devastating drought around Mackay in the mid&hyphen;1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Canegrowers Network, which Rita has been instrumental in setting up, is a workshop for women to learn more about accounting, bookkeeping and all the other necessary skills to be successful in farming. As well as that, they have a forum. Canegrowers Network is now one of the most incisive critics of policy for rural women and rural areas. They regularly have speakers of note and are not afraid to put the questions that need to be put to leaders of rural industry. Rita's attitude has been to make the most of things and not to expect too much from that which you have no control over. Such resilience of attitude has enabled her to identify those issues affecting the women who form the backbone of Australia's rural industry and to lead the way in addressing them and fostering the determination of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to talk about Sandra Eatough, the first woman to be elected to the board of the Queensland Fruit and Vegetable 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Growers Association. Sandra is a mother, wife, cook and employer and grows about 600 acres of tomatoes around Bowen, in central northern Queensland. In her spare time&mdash;and it is hard to imagine that somebody like Sandra would have any spare time&mdash;she sits on the boards and committees of at least four rural associations and councils. For nearly 30 years she and her family have struggled as they have come to terms with the fact that as primary producers they remain at the bottom of the ladder in terms of their ability to effectively control the outcome of their efforts. Sandra remains confident that, by raising an awareness of those issues which unduly affect the industry and her role in it, she is actively contributing to its development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to speak of Jeanette Hunter, who has largely had an academic background but is now the Chief Executive Officer for the Bowen District Growers Association. She has found the ultimate satisfaction in employing her knowledge within the horticultural industry whereby she hopes to train and empower the next generation. She has witnessed a metamorphosis not only within horticulture but across the whole of rural industry as women eagerly embrace the relatively new concepts of quality management and assurance and take the lead in fostering greater understanding and better relationships with government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, I would like to speak about Jeanette Gray. She is a partner in Gray's sawmill in Proserpine. She raises two beautiful girls on her own and again in her spare time finds time to be an adviser on the educational policy committee to the Queensland government and is treasurer of the Forest Industries Training and Employment Committee. She is a lady who is outstanding in her community, always giving time to the community and to rural endeavours. She is a lady very wise about primary industry matters and her membership of organisations is eagerly sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These women are not unique. They exist in large numbers and potentially represent one of the most powerful sectors of rural industry. For this they certainly need to be recognised, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10482"> and I believe that their contribution to the Australian economy needs to be quantified&mdash;not only their work every day of their lives for their farms and their businesses but their wider contribution through community and industry organisations. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also agree with the words of the motion of the member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), although I do not believe that mere recognition goes far enough in our consideration of the needs of women in agriculture. There are many aspects which the census would certainly pick up, but there are many it would not and women have been fighting to be recognised as equal partners in rural industries for some time. This government has taken away the little assistance that was available, especially in child care and many other aspects of the rural adjustment package as it affects women and families in rural Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have some exceptionally talented women, and Tasmanian women are no exception. I would like to take the opportunity of mentioning the contribution made by Jane Bennett, of my electorate, to Tasmania's rural economy. She was the ABC 1997 Australian Rural Woman of the Year and recently, although the honourable member for McEwen was unable to be with us, the Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs was able to visit her cheese factory in Elizabeth Town in my electorate. At 28 years old, this young woman was certainly due that recognition as Australian Rural Woman of the Year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Bennett started in the cheese business about four years ago, and Ashgrove now produces about 100 tonnes of cheese a year and is the only producer in Australia of the signature cheeses that are made there. They are an English style of cheese which is pretty unique to Tasmania and to the palate, and I recommend to everyone that they have a taste of them. Jane studied dairy technology at Victoria's Gilbert Chandler College for two years and then spent two years working at several farmhouse cheesemakers in the United Kingdom before establishing Ashgrove. She is involved in dairy industry packages for school children from grades 2 to 12 and also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for TAFE students. She is currently President of the Tasmanian Rural Industry Training Board, Secretary of the Meander Valley Enterprise Centre and is an executive member of the Dairy Industry Association of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion picks up on several issues, and when the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) mentioned the hoax in rural Australia I think he was quite right. This motion does touch on the census issue, and there are many points that need to be picked up within Australia and rural Australia, including the lack of opportunities for rural woman to go to training and educational courses. There are also the women who do not actually live on properties but live in country areas&mdash;some of them on the coast&mdash;who do not have access to child care. It is very hard to get child care now in rural and regional Australia because it is all privatised and there is very little government assistance in that area. So the women in my electorate have great difficulties in undertaking opportunities of part&hyphen;time work because of the lack of child care that exists there. I am sure that some of the statistics that may come forward if this motion is carried and dealt with by government will be of assistance to them. The women who pick up the vegetables need child care at certain times of the year, the women who work in the splitting sheds need opportunities&mdash;</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10483">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> expresses its warmest congratulations to the many Australian sportsmen and sportswomen who have achieved so much recently representing themselves and their country to the highest levels;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recognises our world champions&mdash;Cathy Freeman, Michael Doohan and the mens under 23 basketball team&mdash;and congratulates them on their achievement;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> asks the Australian media to become more responsible when reporting sporting achievement and commenting about our sporting champions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There has been a lot of negative press around the country in recent times and not enough positive press about some of our sporting heroes. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  is a bit opposite to that, and today they have a photo of all our triathletes who competed on the weekend in Western Australia. I think we should be celebrating more often the sporting achievements of our sporting heroes not only at an elite level but also at a local level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, being a fine sportsman yourself, Australia has a proud modern history of sporting achievement. We are passionate about our involvement, we are great spectators and we also like to have a bit of a gamble on different results, whether they be flies up the wall or whatever it is. Australia has an outdoors lifestyle and we really appreciate those who get involved in sporting contests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent achievements include those of the triathletes in Perth yesterday: Emma Carney and Chris McDermont. Of course Cathy Freeman, Michael Doohan and Louise Savage, a paralympian, are world champions. Other recent achievements include those by the Pan Pac swimming team; Karrie Webb, the golfer, who is also performing very well; the Australian cycling team; the Australian under&hyphen;23 basketball team, who are now world champions; the Socceroos, who are going to France next year; the Australian cricket team, which won the Ashes this year when all predictions were against them; and of course Patrick Rafter and Kirstie Marshall are also world 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> champions. In Patrick Rafter's case, he is ranked No. 2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many fine achievers and I am sure there are many more who are achieving a lot in Australia and overseas as sporting elites. I cannot name them all today, but in my electorate of Cowan we also have many sporting heroes amongst our other community champions. We have Lucy Tyler Sharman, Graham Sharman and Darren Hill, who are world cycling champions; Tracy Cross, a Paralympic gold medallist in swimming; Scott Hunter&hyphen;Russell, who is an archery Olympian; Clint Pegrum, a junior badminton champion; Kim Morecom and Marianna Vlahov, wais breaker players; Kathleen Smart from the Orioles; Brett Mulder from the state cricket team; and Daniel Grigson, who is at the AIS doing gymnastics. There are many others within the seat of Cowan who are performing extremely well in sporting endeavours, along with all of the others who are participating very well in community endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there has been a bit of darkness over recent times&mdash;a bit of a tarnish amongst all of these achievements&mdash;and that is the Australian press. They need to take more responsibility when they are reporting sporting events and, in particular, when they are talking about sporting champions. For instance Mark Taylor, when he was over in England, was vilified extremely badly. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> stated that someone had to sack Mark Taylor if he would not do it himself, and that he had been indulged long enough. They went on to say that he was performing so badly it was affecting the rest of the team and their performance. Well, we won the Ashes and Taylor was man of the match in the last test. I wonder when we are going to hear these great journalists saying how wonderful he is again. You might remember Greg Smith, the former coach of the Wallabies. He was vilified for winning only 12 out of 19 games. What now that the Wallabies lost against Argentina and drew against England? Do we suggest that we sack the current coach?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need to do is to stop this tall poppy syndrome among our journalists. We need to be paying our sporting heroes more respect. We need to stop cutting down our tall 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10484"> poppies, those people who are out there achieving for our country and also for themselves. I call upon the scribes of our great nation to look upon the skills of our champions and allow them to go about their business without the harassment and the haranguing they get in the press from these commentators. And when they do perform well, perhaps it is time to give them credit, as journalists should be doing now with the captain of our Australian cricket side, Mark Taylor. I commend the motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to discuss a motion such as this and I thank the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) for sponsoring it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone who has often described himself as a spectator sportsman, I take great joy in the efforts of a number of Australians as individuals and Australians who represent Australia in team sports. The honourable member for Cowan has listed a whole host of sporting champions and I do not wish to in any way, by picking out one or two of those, denigrate the efforts of all of those he has mentioned. Today, I want to speak about the men's under&hyphen;23 basketball team, which won the world championship, particularly because I was a spectator on that night at the Melbourne tennis centre and because of my knowledge of a couple of the players in the team. It meant something special not only to me but also to my family because of our interest in the sport of basketball.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the players is Sam MacKinnon, better known as `Slamming Sammy' MacKinnon, who has played local basketball in the northern suburbs of Melbourne and on one occasion, I think, slam dunked over my oldest son. Another one whose fortunes I was looking at was Frank Drmic, who has played representative basketball down Dandenong way, again in teams which my son has played against. To have seen players like those two come up from the under&hyphen;14s and under&hyphen;16s and then represent their country at the under&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">23 level was something that I will always remember. The honourable member for Cowan was right in saying that perhaps there is not sufficient media coverage of these types of things. The fact that these championships were played in Melbourne enabled a greater focus on the achievement of that team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another person mentioned in the honourable member's motion was Cathy Freeman. Again, giving this a personal note, I am very pleased that my six&hyphen;year&hyphen;old daughter, whenever she sees photos of Cathy Freeman, recognises those photos and looks at this as somebody who is important and is a hero&mdash;somebody whose efforts are welcomed by all and who gives inspiration to young people who are setting out to try to achieve. The important thing, when we look at these elite sportspersons, is not to say that everybody has to achieve that level; but they can seek inspiration from and involvement in sporting and recreational activities and they should be encouraged&mdash;as the Little Athletics movement does&mdash;to do their best and achieve their personal best. It is not about winning, it is about participating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to highlight the last point of the honourable member's motion, where he asks the media to be a bit more positive about the way they portray sport. In particular, I want to emphasise the way in which they portray women's sport, because the efforts of the Australian media in this area are absolutely appalling. If there is something spoken about in my time in this place where we have seen very little progress, it is the treatment of sportswomen in the media. I think the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) would have been on the legal and constitutional committee that looked at these aspects as part of a wider look at equal opportunity and the way in which women are accepted within society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, when the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) was the parliamentary secretary, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Invisible Games</EMPHASIS> report on media coverage there was an analysis of television coverage&mdash;the ABC, SBS, and channels 7, 9 and 10. It revealed the following result for coverage of women's sport: 1.2 per cent. In a study of the 1996 figures in a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10485"> report released&mdash;and I rely on the press release of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), the then Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government&mdash;women's sport represented just two per cent of television sport aired in 1996. It represented 10.7 of print coverage and it represented 6.8 per cent of magazine coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even allowing that some of the coverage is for mixed sport, these figures are appalling. Perhaps it is coincidental, but it heartens me a little when I look at today's media to find either Jane Crafter appearing on the front sports pages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> or Emma Carney appearing on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>. If we go to the coverage of the triathlon world championships, nearly three&hyphen;quarters is for the female side and only one&hyphen;quarter for the male side, and that is positive. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to support the motion of the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) today, especially as the representative of the seat of Lindsay, which has within it the Penrith Lakes rowing course. It has been selected as the Olympic venue and it is something which our region is incredibly proud of. However, it is not the only showcase sporting venue that we have. We have the Panthers Stadium and a number of other sporting facilities which the Panthers organisation provides for Lindsay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our rugby union team is looking towards getting their own ground as we move towards retention in the first division. We have a number of golf courses. In fact, Penrith Lakes is developing another 18-hole golf course in our area. Our basketball teams go from strength to strength, working their way up from the CBA to the NBL. We have had a number of very successful equestrian events. Recently, in the greater western Sydney games, we had an equestrian event which was sponsored by J.K. Williams and held in the Panthers Stadium. It was a very successful event. All competing athletes found it one of the nicest venues in which to hold a showjumping event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In cricket we have great products from Lindsay like Mike Slater and in swimming we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have Emma Johnson. In hockey we have a facility on which astroturf has just been laid, and we are looking for sponsorship to develop that facility into a world-class venue. Our netball goes from strength to strength every year. Our little athletics are absolutely fantastic. I was at the Werrington little athletics on the weekend. I know that Natalie King and Sarah Walker of the Werrington little athletics look up to athletes like Cathy Freeman for inspiration and vision when they are competing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a number of facilities for bowlers in our aged community and for our young bowlers. Nepean is also well known for its triathlon. In the first week of December we will have the Nepean triathlon, one of the oldest triathlons in Australia&mdash;or in the world for that matter. I am competing in a team in that triathlon. Someone else is doing the swim and bike legs for me and I will be doing the 10&hyphen;kilometre run. I competed in the five&hyphen;kilometre Nepean fun run on the weekend and came second in my age category. This goes a long way to promoting activity and an active life right throughout life. It is important as we work towards ageing well that we have a system where our elderly are active right throughout life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we give media coverage not only to our sportswomen, as commented on by you in your contribution, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, but also to our aged competitors. Recently I competed in the Masters Games in Canberra. We had soccer players and rugby players right through their 50s and 60s still competing in fairly active sports. It certainly is an incentive to train. I know that when I have no goal in mind it is easy to slip that morning training. With a lot of promotion, the Masters Games are great tourist events for Australia, especially when they were backed up in Adelaide two weeks later with the World Masters Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is great to see so many people staying fit and active for that length of time. It is important that the media coverage recognises people's interests and trends in society and keeps on giving it a positive image. I think people are very tired of the negative stories in the media. When they pick up media these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10486"> days they find a very cynical look in media pieces. I think the statistics cited by you, Mr Deputy Speaker, were that 1.2 per cent of all television coverage of sport was directed towards women's sport in 1994. By 1996 it had risen to only two per cent. We certainly have to see that coverage rising, as well as covering aged sports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to draw particular attention to Mick Doohan, who I think is a great Aussie hero. Motor cycling events are very popular in my electorate. Mick Doohan has a fantastic record; it is virtually an unbeatable one. I think the only person who comes close to him is Giacomo Agostini, with eight world titles in the 500cc class. He only had 88 top three finishes, though, and Mick Doohan looks close to beating that this season or next. Mick Doohan has had a four&hyphen;year straight run as the world No. 1 in the 500cc class in the Grand Prix. He certainly is a hero in my electorate. He is a great Australian and a great example for a lot of young roadsters. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am privileged to be able to rise in this debate and support the motion moved by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). None of us should be backwards in congratulating the many successful young sportswomen and sportsmen of our nation. Young sportswomen have a model in Cathy Freeman, who deserves our praise for her commitment to her sport and her willingness not to be bullied by anyone wherever she is competing. Her activities are no doubt an inspiration to the many thousands of young women athletes, particularly to indigenous Australians competing around the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion recognises outstanding Australian performances in athletics, motor cycle racing, basketball, swimming, cricket and cycling. All of these sports are conducted within and in the near vicinity of my electorate of Greenway. This motion gives me an opportunity to extol the virtues of the many young and not so young sports men and women from around the nation, particularly from my own electorate of Greenway and the Blacktown local government area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to mention 11 local sports men and women who have already qualified as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sportsperson of the month and are now eligible for the 1997 Blacktown city sportsperson of the year award. In athletics we have Narelle Roberts, who won seven gold medals at the Pan Pacific School Games, and Bradley Birrell, who one nine gold medals at the same games. Tim Edwards won the mixed doubles, men's doubles and men's singles at the 1996 New South Wales Deaf Tennis Championships. Tim Bollins, in his sport of boat racing, won the Australian 400cc Outboard Championships. In cycling, Patricia Coxan won three bronze medals at the Australian Track Cycling Championships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In race walking, we have Renee McAskill, who is the Australian under&hyphen;16 road champion. Keven Spence recently won the under 50 kilogram national title at the Australian Karate National Championships. Casey Giteau won a gold medal at the Australian Age&hyphen;swimming Championships and Tony Liang won first prize at the New South Wales Tae Kwon Do Tournament in the intermediate middle black belt division. The achievements of these local athletes fit neatly within the terms of this private member's motion. In the spirit of point (1) of the motion, I add my congratulations to the abovementioned sports people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within Greenway, there is a very competitive ice&hyphen;skating and ice hockey club operating out of the Blacktown ice&hyphen;skating rink. In the spirit of this private member's motion, I would like to also mention the achievements of these fine athletes: at the Australian Figure Skating Championships, Phillip Champion and Margaret Albia won the Novice Pairs Championship; Mathew Francis won a silver medal in the Intermediate Men's Championship; and Raquel Ashley won a silver medal in the Primary Ladies Championship. Blacktown club won a bronze medal in the Novice Precision Championship. In ice hockey, the Blacktown club won the under&hyphen;11, under&hyphen;13, under&hyphen;16 and under-18 New South Wales championships, and the under&hyphen;16 team won the Australian national championships. I again congratulate all outstanding sports people in Greenway and, in terms of point (4) of this motion, I urge our three local papers, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guardian</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advocate</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fairfax Sun</EMPHASIS> to keep 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10487"> up their good work in supporting our local sports people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to mention that a delegation of Chinese Olympic officials recently visited Blacktown to look at possible training facilities for their Olympic athletes. The delegation inspected the Blacktown Aquatic Centre, the New South Wales soccer complex, the interim softball facility at Parklea and the site for the new Olympic softball stadium at Aquilina Reserve. The Nurringingy Reserve was also visited as part of the roving showcase of Blacktown's sporting facilities. All of these developments spell out an outstanding future for all sports in Greenway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another major development for sport in western Sydney, Blacktown has scored a major coup with the cream of the world's wheelchair basketballers arriving in October 1998. As reported in the Blacktown <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advocate</EMPHASIS> by Rhett Watson, the Rooty Hill RSL Club and resort have secured a deal to accommodate more than 300 athletes and organisers for the International Gold Cup. The Kevin Betts Stadium at Mount Druitt will be the main training area.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Wheelchair Basketball Federation president, Philip Craven, a former British team captain, toured the resort last Wednesday.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in support of the motion by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). In doing so, I would like to personally congratulate the many Australian sports men and women who dedicate their lives to representing Australia and themselves at international and national events. Australia has a glorious history&mdash;an outstanding record&mdash;of sporting achievements in a wide variety of sports. As a relatively small nation in terms of our population, we have always been competitive against much larger nations around the world. From individual athletes in swimming and cycling to team sports like cricket and football, Australia has been represented proudly in recent years. It is very important that the men and women who put 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so much time and effort into what can sometimes be a very thankless and financially demanding profession be recognised by this parliament and the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although these people achieve great personal satisfaction through their profession, they also give all Australians great sporting entertainment and pride. I am sure that there are not many people who did not get goose bumps when watching Kieren Perkins and Daniel Kowalski take gold and silver in the 1500-metre freestyle at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics&mdash;a very proud moment for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Events like the Commonwealth Games, Olympic Games and Paralympic Games are times when our Australian sporting competitors are most visibly recognised by our country and the world. It is considered the toughest and most elite competition. Although I dare say this is the truth, there are also many other sporting events in which Australia competes and succeeds. From the tennis grand slams to international iron&hyphen;man competitions, Australia has a diverse sporting community. Sometimes this means that remarkable achievements and efforts are not always given the recognition they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank some people who have done well in recent months. For the first time since 1987, an Australian has won a tennis grand slam competition. Pat Rafter has excelled in tennis, taking out the American Open. After years of hard work and dedication, he has certainly earned his huge popularity surge. It is great to see this young man succeed, and I would like to congratulate him for his fine performance to date and wish him well in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the recent Pan Pacific swimming championships held in Japan, Australia presented fierce competition in what was a highly successful meet. Sam Riley broke yet another record in the women's 100&hyphen;metre butterfly. Congratulations to Sam and the Australian team for their very fine effort. Susie Maroney recently became the first person to swim from Cuba to the United States. This is one of the most strenuous sporting quests and Susie certainly has done herself proud. I congratulate her also. As much as it is very important 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10488"> to thank and congratulate the Cathy Freemans, Pat Rafters and Mick Doohans, it is equally important to congratulate all those who make the team to compete and represent this country to the best of their ability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Steve Brimacombe, Daniela Costan, Lynda Lehamn, Robert McEwen and Ian Traill are names that are not as familiar to us, but they are just a few of the many Queenslanders who represented Australia at the Olympic Games last year. These people, like hundreds of others from around the nation, have trained over long and daunting hours, often while holding down a full&hyphen; or part&hyphen;time job to make the team and compete at international level for their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be remembered that for every Shane Warne or Todd Woodbridge there are hundreds of less well&hyphen;known sporting competitors. I personally acknowledge and thank these people. After all, through the ages sport has always been about fun and enjoyment, not whether you win or lose. The achievement of reaching the team and of representing Australia is one which should make us all very proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because Australia's sporting arena is so diverse, it is an unfortunate fact that some sports do not receive as much attention from the media as others. It is extremely important that all sports receive support from the media and, as a community, we should be asking the media to adopt a new approach to representing and reporting sport. The emphasis needs to be shifted back to the enjoyment of sport. Many sporting competitors love to win and, yes, Australians love a winner. But Australians also love the underdog and love to have fun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think many of us felt that it was a very dark chapter in our sports history when the media placed so much intense pressure on our swimming team in Atlanta to the point where many of our competitors felt that they had let Australia down. That was not the case. Each did us proud and never again should we allow such an unfair and daunting emphasis on the gold medal tally. A tally is just a figure; it is not what sport is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also sports in which Australians dominate but which attract very little media 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recognition. The Australian women's netball team has been the best in the world for years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion of the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), but I do note that his intentions are not matched by the actions of his government nor those of other Liberal governments in Australia. The House ought to recognise the achievements of prominent sportspeople for the benefits that they deliver the Australian community. There is no doubt that all of us walk taller as a result of sporting success, whether we achieve it through a national team or through the individual brilliance of highly trained athletes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, to spend time today congratulating only the high profile sports men, women and teams in Australia, many of whom are paid very handsomely for their efforts, is to ignore other heroes of Australian sporting life&mdash;for example, the umpires. Recently one of the residents of Oak Park in the electorate of Wills, Mr Jim Ainsworth, umpired his 1,000th suburban football match. You can think of players, and perhaps umpires, getting to 400 or 500 games, but for someone involved in football to be lasting 1,000 games, least of all an umpire, is an extraordinary achievement. Jim Ainsworth has shown remarkable commitment and dedication to the game. He officiated at 332 Metropolitan Football League games before transferring to the Northern Metropolitan League where he completed 322 games. Umpiring two games a week must have been a very exhausting weekend for him. In that way he has made a terrific contribution to the sport of football.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that the member for Cowan's support for elite Australian sports participants is not matched by the actions of his government. It ought to be noted that in 1996-97 the government's budget cut $6 million from the Australian Sports Commission and in excess of $20 million over four years. That has the potential to severely reduce the community's participation in both 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10489"> elite and sport&hyphen;for&hyphen;all programs and affect Australia's preparation for the Sydney Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen base funding and running costs reduced in a situation where high profile elite sports may prosper but broad participation will suffer. Measures eliminating funding for minor sports, phasing out funding to peak sporting bodies and abolishing management subsidies for what are regarded as comparatively wealthy sports has highlighted these concerns. A total of 28 sporting associations have had their funding cut, including netball. Recfish Australia, the peak body representing sports fishers&mdash;some 220,000 registered fishing club members participate in competitions year round&mdash;has had its meagre funding of $77,000 per annum cut completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have here a circumstance where the Olympic program is funded, which is commendable and expected, but sport is also about mums, dads and the kids getting out at the weekends and engaging in healthy activities. Regrettably, the government's policies are putting that broad participation at risk. That is against a background where Australia has a well deserved reputation as a sporting nation with more people participating on and off the sports field and a record number being paid for their efforts.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to talk about the circumstances facing veterans in my community of Jagajaga. I am very pleased to see at the table the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who I hope will take very seriously the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concerns that have been raised with me by very many people in my electorate. They go to two issues in particular. One is the future of the repatriation hospital, which is located at Heidelberg. This hospital is now part of a  bigger conglomerate hospital known as the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre. As the minister may know&mdash;in fact, I very much hope he is well informed&mdash;the Victorian state government has decided to privatise the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre. This is of great concern to the whole community in and around Heidelberg but particularly of concern to the veterans of the area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the minister and the House of the record of ongoing commitment to veterans and war widows that was signed on 1 January 1995. That agreement said that the Commonwealth and the Victorian governments would formally guarantee continuing access to Heidelberg&mdash;that means the repatriation hospital&mdash;and to other public hospitals in Victoria to ensure that the health needs of veterans and war widows entitled to repatriation health care are met. It goes on to say that the state will also ensure that Heidelberg continues as a major centre of excellence, maintaining its role as an acute care teaching institution linked to the University of Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue is very pertinent, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, and I know of concern to you as your electorate is in the neighbouring area. This issue of whether or not veterans will continue to have access to a major public hospital that has  teaching and research at its core is at threat by the actions of the Victorian government. From my point of view and from the point of view of the people of Heidelberg and the surrounding area, it is very important that this minister actually stands up for veterans and prevents the sell-off of the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre, which is of course what the Kennett government wants to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is the Kennett government selling off&mdash;obviously with the quiet agreement of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, encouraging the sell&hyphen;off&mdash;our major public assets, our public hospitals. What we want to see in the electorate of Jagajaga&mdash;and, I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10490"> would suggest, more broadly&mdash;is public hospitals available for the public; that the public's interest, in terms of their health, is put first and not the private profits of particular providers. That is not why we have public hospitals. That is not any reason for what is planned by this state government and which is quietly condoned by the federal minister sitting opposite. The Austin and Repat sell-off is part of a wider sell-off of essential community assets. It also includes the sell-off of the Royal Talbot and the North Eastern Psychiatric Network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has taken quite a lot of effort to get the information available on this issue because the Kennett government has been most reluctant to come forward. We have heard no criticism from the minister on this issue. We have heard no criticism at all in this place of the Kennett government's actions to privatise essential health services&mdash;an essential public hospital, the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre in Heidelberg. Not one word of criticism has come from this minister to protect the interests of veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will we see? We will see a complete removal of the capacity for this hospital to be a centre of excellence in teaching, which it is now with the University of Melbourne. Its research capacity, which is world renowned, will be lost once it is privatised. Its capacity to deliver the services that both veterans and the broader community have come to expect will also be lost. This is very serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a major campaign under way locally to try to protect this hospital from the sell-off intentions of the Kennett government. There was a major public meeting in the electorate last week, which many people who were very concerned about the intentions of the government to sell&hyphen;off their hospital attended. There is a rally planned for next Friday which all members of the community are urged to attend. All veterans in particular are urged to attend to make sure this federal government has its attention brought to what is a major sell&hyphen;off of this very significant asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue I wanted to raise also goes to the interests of veterans. The Greensborough sub-branch of the RSL has written to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> me and spoken to me about a very serious matter, which we have debated in this place before. They have written to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), to the minister at the table, to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), others in the RSL and so on about their concerns of the intention of the government to extend a change in social security arrangements to veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government has done for social security recipients who find themselves unemployed when they are over the age of 55 is moved the goal posts. What they are being told now is, `You have to use up your superannuation benefits before you can get any help from this government.' You have to be completely down and out before this government will help you. If anybody thought they were saving for their retirement with their superannuation, they can now think again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened in this House a few months ago was that the minister at the table tried to suggest that this rule should also apply to veterans&mdash;that veterans who had superannuation, who were over the age of 55 and who had lost their jobs should have to use up their superannuation before they would get any access to unemployment benefits or any access to disability support. There are many people in this situation who are disabled and who cannot work. But this government's attitude is, `No, you eat into your retirement benefits.' I have never heard of a more short-sighted policy approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Veterans, like other members of the community, have very small levels of superannuation. This government is saying to them, `You use up those retirement savings and then we might think about helping you.' As the minister at the table knows, the Labor opposition stopped the government extending this measure to veterans. We are still waiting to see whether or not the government will reconsider its position and make sure that veterans can rest easy and know that if they do lose their jobs over the age of 55 this government will not be seeking to bring this legislation back into the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we want to know is that the government will not bring this legislation back into the parliament to try to make sure that, as was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10491"> their intention, veterans use up their superannuation when they lose their jobs or find themselves disabled. What we would like to hear, and what all the RSLs around the country would like to hear, is that this minister will stand up for them and make sure that veterans are not disadvantaged by this government's mean&hyphen;spirited approach to other social security recipients, that it will not extend this measure to veterans and that it will make sure that if veterans find themselves unemployed or disabled they will be able to get the support and encouragement to get another job that they are due.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would like to see this measure extended to all social security recipients. It is the case that the vast majority of people over the age of 55 do want to continue working. They do not want to find themselves having to eat into their retirement benefits before they are ready to retire. I hope we hear from the minister at the table today to put the concerns of veterans at ease and tell them that they will not have to use up their superannuation before they are ready to do so.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10491"><TITLE>Native Title: Reconciliation</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This nation was built on a lie, and until the lie is purged from its soul we will never reach a maturity that is confident and capable of delivering justice to all citizens. We got off to the wrong start 209 years ago. At the time of European settlement Australia was not recognised as occupied. Observations of the natives failed to see either a system of law or a system of land use and thus the Australian continent was considered vacant, belonging to no-one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June 1992 the High Court of Australia laid this lie to rest, 204 years too late. Attempts since then to address the lie, over 200 years after the fact, at the legislative and public policy level have been compromised by political and economic circumstances. Until a heartfelt effort is made across Australia, reflected in the actions of all governments, we will never achieve meaningful reconciliation. There is no-one in this parliament who can be proud of their efforts to bring about reconciliation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present government, of which I am a member, has failed to grasp the seriousness of the race crisis that we face in this country and its underlying causes. Whether real or not, alongside our refusal to apologise to the stolen generation, there is a perception in the Australian community that we are mean spirited and that we have put the rights of pastoral and mining communities ahead of the rights of Aboriginal Australians in our attempt to deal with the ongoing manifestations of the lie. In politics, rightly or wrongly, perception is everything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government is far from blameless in its dealings with this crisis and it deepened the divisions between black and white Australia by politicising race. A prize example is last week's contribution from the previous Prime Minister. If it were not over such a serious issue, it would be laughable. Reinventing history, a favourite pastime of some ex-politicians, Mr Keating revisited his government's position on the extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases. I quote from Keating the former, courtesy of ABC radio, in October 1993 and from Keating the latter, courtesy of ABC television, on 11 November this year. Keating the former said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I negotiated an agreement between the Aboriginal community and the National Farmers' Federation on the question of pastoral leases and, I think, with a very good outcome. What it will mean is that native title will be extinguished on pastoral leases&mdash;that is, not to the extent of inconsistency, but extinguished.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Keating the latter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean, how savage and mean have you got to be to actually wipe out their&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">native&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">title when they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">pastoralists&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">can graze and the native title rights can exist, can co-exist, and the incidence of co-existence is not a problem?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Keating the PM extinguishes native title over pastoral leases. He meant to do so and his best advice said that he did. Keating the reinvented, roving statesman after his metamorphosis, sees it as savage and mean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have a contribution from the One Nation party, a more misrepresentative term 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10492"> for what a political party represents I have never before heard. They would have Australians believe that the less than noble savages sat picnicking on the banks of rivers, eating their young. Why would anyone want to depict Aboriginal Australians in this way? It has done more damage to this nation's psyche and to its future than anything else in its history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A more realistic depiction of the relationship between indigenous Australians and European settlers in the new colony is represented by the Myall Creek massacre. We ignore this reality at the peril of the future of the Australian nation. In June 1838 white stockmen slaughtered around 30 Aboriginal men, women and children. I quote from remarks that Judge Burton made in sentencing the guilty men for a description of the event:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A party of blacks were seated around their fires, which they had just made up for the night&mdash;they were resting secure in the protection of one of you&mdash;they were totally unsuspecting when they were suddenly surrounded by a band of armed men, of whom you, the prisoners at the bar, were half and all of you were equally guilty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The blacks fled for the hut of one of you for safety, but that hut proved the mesh of their destruction. In that hut, amid the tears, the sighs, the sobs, and the groans of the unhappy victims, you bound them, one by one with cords&mdash;the father, the mother and the child&mdash;you led them away, a small distance from the hut where one and all, with the exception of one woman, met one common destruction.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The judge went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extraordinary pains were taken by someone, either by yourselves or persons interested in the concealment of the affair, to keep it from coming to light. You burnt the bodies for the purpose of concealment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Afterwards, someone removed even the remains that were left. The place was swept, varnished that no vestige might remain . . . But not withstanding all the efforts that were made, the rib bone and the jaw bone of a child, and some teeth, were found on the spot.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I shudder to think what happened to the one woman who was not slaughtered with the rest of her people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent massacre of this magnitude in Australia caused deeply felt anguish across the country. The nation stood in shock and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> demanded justice for the actions of Martin Bryant. But in December 1838, when Judge Burton sentenced the Myall Creek murderers to death, there was an outcry in the colony that white men should die just for slaughtering Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a different view of our history from that put forward by the One Nation party, and it is the reality. It is essentially fear and ignorance that has allowed the race crisis to ignite out of control. I wonder how many Australians gain exposure to the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two weeks ago the Joint Committee on Treaties visited Alice Springs to gather evidence on indigenous issues arising from Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We could not proceed with formal hearings because an opposition senator failed to show up and thus we did not have a quorum, but some witnesses agreed to give evidence regardless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Kim Wright from the Youth Accommodation and Support Services Network Inc. in Alice Springs told the committee about the work of her organisation, and her evidence was breathtaking. We all know that the removal of Aboriginal people from their land has decimated their lives, but to hear about the very real consequences of this fact on children and adolescents was quite devastating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aboriginal people who camp outside the town have no home to go to. It is hard to build a life when you are homeless. There is an American proverb, over 100 years old: home is where the heart is. For the Aboriginal people that is just as true, and their hearts are in their traditional lands which they have lost. They have thus lost their means to provide for themselves and their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence presented to the committee included a discussion on petrol sniffing. It is not just a way to escape a grim reality; it takes away the pain of a stomach that is always empty. Young Aboriginal people visit Ms Wright's service because they do not want to be hungry, they do not want to become drunk. They want somewhere to sleep away from their families where they see violence and drunkenness.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10493">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not too many Australians have the opportunity to meet people in this situation or the people who work with them to discover this truth, so ignorance breeds fear. Since June 1992 the fear has been fuelled by a misunderstanding of what native title is. Unlike the Western concept of land ownership based on exclusive possession, native title means something quite different. Native title rights are about Aboriginal Australians continuing to experience their way of life, their culture and their traditions by accessing the land upon which those traditions are based. Take away the land and you take away a culture, its traditions and its means of support. Native title is not about exclusive possession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court's Mabo decision was the first real step to address the lie upon which this country was built and to reverse the consequential injustice to a race of people for whom it may be too late anyway. The previous government's response was the Native Title Act 1993, which extinguished native title over freehold land and was expected to extinguish native title over leasehold land. A more just model might have been found in the Canadian experience. The Canadian model is based on regional agreements which have had the benefit of the fact that Canada was not built on a lie; it has recognised native title since 1763. Nonetheless, regional agreements backed by the High Court's decision may have provided a more just base from which to negotiate competing rights between land&hyphen;holders and traditional owners across the country than blanket extinguishment. That course was not taken by the previous government, and now we must face the situation as it exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make an observation, in the name of improving relationships between the government and Aboriginal Australians, on the outburst of Noel Pearson when he called the government racist scum. I am glad he now apparently regrets using the word `scum', because he should. As a government member, I take exception to being labelled in this way. I hope that I am not a racist. I believe that each human being begins life as a very valuable, perhaps sacred, entity and that no person is worth more than another. If this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> makes me a racist, Noel Pearson, then so be it, but your outburst did little to mend the relationship between your people, the government and its supporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Pearson could well learn from the dignified way in which Mr Pat Dodson has served the process of reconciliation. Mr Dodson has earned the respect of Australians, and I congratulate him and thank him for his great and hopefully ongoing contribution to reconciliation. I grieve for the future of my country until the lie is purged from its reality and from its soul.

<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went to the last election stating `small business is the engine room of jobs growth'. Most of the enterprises ruthlessly culled by the coalition in this and other industries have been small businesses. Mr Prime Minister, you have steered the ship on to an iceberg, your engine room has flooded and our neighbours to the north are already bidding over the rights to salvage the wreck of the once good ship Australia. Your sacrifices on the altar of free trade may pay homage to your lords the internationalists, but they reduce your own people to a life of bitterness and in some cases poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on evidence presented by Professor Roy Powell of the University of New England, the special committee of inquiry regional study tour concluded that reductions in log supplies of 50 per cent in New South Wales would result in the loss of 2,500 jobs and about $800 million of domestic product. Industry figures estimate that around 500 small timber industry businesses will be unviable and forced to close. Countless dependent businesses and associated jobs will also be forever lost. What a great plan! Did you really think of this on your own? It is appropriate to quote Don Page, the National Party member from Ballina, from the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New South Wales forest policy: failures of the Labor government</EMPHASIS>. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extensive areas of productive forest, which have sustained rural economies and jobs throughout NSW for decades, have quickly been declared national park and wilderness. This action has occurred before Regional Forest Agreements have been completed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When the sawmill in Glen Innes closed, the local mayor said that the loss of such a major employer was a calamity. How true of so many cases everywhere, yet so understated. The mayor of Tenterfield said that the government's actions had devastated the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community, posing additional hardship to already struggling rural families. The mayor of Grafton stated that you could see a look of despair on the faces of country people. In Bombala the mayor described log reductions and sawmill closures as a fatal blow. At Wingham and Mount George the story was the same, with the closure of local mills and the loss of related engineering businesses. Even the Kempsey brickworks, which was designed to run on sawmill residue, may now also be forced to close. Other closures and similar upheaval and misery have occurred in the towns of Eden, Captains Flat, Gloucester and Wauchope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already some 50 per cent of native forest in New South Wales has been locked up before the completion of regional forestry agreements and comprehensive resource assessments. The government's work to destroy this industry is clear and almost complete. So much for the coalition's commitment to small business. So much for the coalition's commitment to jobs. Quite simply, so much for the coalition. Despite over the last two years the honourable member for Gwydir, now Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), being made well and truly aware of the facts and acknowledging the severity of the situation, he has done nothing&mdash;just another example of the treacherous behaviour displayed by the Nationals to the bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales Timbers Association was formed from small businesses fighting for the survival of their industry. They have faced only hostile state and federal governments. It is only since the New South Wales Timbers Association commenced a class action against the New South Wales state government and federal government over allegations of mismanagement of the forest industry structural adjustment package that the minister has ordered a departmental investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $120 million provided by the state and federal governments was never going to be enough to compensate hundreds of business owners and thousands of sacked employees. Yet this fact was dismissed with the same disdain rural Australians are experiencing everywhere. This money was split, with $60 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10495"> million provided by the New South Wales state government being set aside for redundancies and the remaining $60 million of federal funding being allocated for business exit programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the conditions imposed by the federal government was that an independent tribunal was to be responsible for the allocation of federal funds for business exists. However, the New South Wales Minister for Land and Water Conservation has appointed a committee of industry stakeholders, consisting of Forest Products Association members, Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union members and Department of Primary Industries and Energy personnel. Anyone with eyes and ears knows that this is not an independent tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sum of $40 million has been earmarked to purchase private forest for inclusion into the reserve system, and another $30 million has been reportedly set aside as grants to encourage value adding in the industry. This was not the intended use of compensation money. Also, to date, all known value added grants have gone to members or affiliates of the Forest Products Association's conflicts of interest caused by this government's collusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give the example of a viable family business, established for 22 years, which had its access to resource slashed by half. This business employed 34 people and had liabilities of $1.2 million. This family business received a $400,000 exit package, leaving them with an $800,000 bank liability. This family was deemed to be asset rich and, therefore, not eligible for social security, despite having to fund $12,000 per month to satisfy the greed of the banks. Sadly, this family now has to sell the family home and other assets in a depressed market. This is just one of the many heartbreaking stories being played out across Australia&mdash;the despair arising from such circumstances sometimes ending in suicide.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I grieve on two quite different issues, although both have a substantial impact on people's lives in this country as well as overseas. Firstly, I want to say a few words, yet again, on the scourge and the tragedy that results from the proliferation of antipersonnel landmines around the globe. Secondly, I want to voice the concerns of producers, of rural peak bodies, of production workers and of ordinary people in my electorate and in the electorates of the honourable member for Maranoa, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who is at the table, and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). It is there that the full impact of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10496"> government's recent decisions on the unlimited import of uncooked pig meat from Denmark and processed pig meat from Canada is being questioned&mdash;and being questioned quite vociferously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, on the landmines issue, I think in this place and, indeed, right around the globe, we should welcome the decision this morning by federal cabinet in relation to the signing of the so-called Ottowa treaty. It is a great step forward. It is a victory for humanity, and we should all commend the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and cabinet for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gives me an opportunity to thank the non-government organisations who have been very instrumental behind the scenes&mdash;sometimes strongly, sometimes quietly&mdash;in moving towards this ban; and I thank them on behalf of everybody for the work that they have done over recent years in the lead-up to this decision by Australia. In particular, I want to thank Sister Pak Poy of the coalition, who has done a lot of great work on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst, as somebody who wore a uniform in the Australian Defence Force for three decades, I can understand the reluctance of the hierarchy in the Defence Force to destroy Australian Defence Force stocks, I believe that the decision taken today is the right one; the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which I chair, recommended back in February that this should happen. I think most people in the Defence Force would recognise&mdash;as, indeed, the Ottowa treaty recognises&mdash;the need for defence forces to retain a modest residual stock to make sure that their tactical training levels are maintained and, indeed, that they are able to cover the clearance operations around the globe for which Australia has a high and very deserved reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I congratulate the Prime Minister and the cabinet on a great decision in aid of humanity right around the globe. I would like to read into the record an extract on the antipersonnel landmines from a report by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties which exemplifies the tragedy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the past decade has seen growing numbers of instances where anti-personnel landmines have been used indiscriminately against civilians, despite restrictions placed on their use by the Inhumane 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Weapons Convention in 1983. Since the Second World War, an estimated 400 million anti-personnel landmines have been laid in various parts of the world. The US State Department estimated that there were more than 85 million uncleared mines scattered in 62 countries around the world. As many as another five million new mines may be laid each year. Based on UN programs in Cambodia and Afghanistan, it can cost between $US200 and $US1,000 to clear each mine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The International Committee of the Red Cross stated that for every mine cleared, 20 are laid. According to UN estimates, it would take 1100 years to clear the active landmines already in place and would cost about $US33 billion to rid the world of this scourge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving on to the pork industry and more domestic issues, let me say that I am concerned&mdash;as I pointed out a couple of weeks ago&mdash;for local producers and for the jobs of the 600 workers on the floor at Darling Downs Bacon Co&hyphen;operative in Toowoomba in my electorate, the processor of the well-known KR Darling Downs and Huttons smallgoods brands. I can understand the anger generated in meetings in Toowoomba and Kingaroy recently. Any jobs lost by the region's largest single private employer, Darling Downs Bacon, would have a disastrous social and economic effect at a time when jobs growth is vital to our national recovery. Over the last 12 months, 10,000 tonnes of pig meat have been imported from Canada, nearly three times the ABARE forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Australia might be playing the game on international trade&mdash;indeed we are&mdash;others may not be. A decision by the Anti-dumping Authority early in the year to discontinue countervailing and dumping duties for canned hams came at a time when swine fever was discovered in the Netherlands' 800,000 herd. A big question mark, therefore, persists over exotic diseases not present in the existing Australian pig herds. Although the minister and AQIS have had something to say about this since the government's decision about 10 days ago, there is still a big question mark in the minds of producers and people in Australia generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's clean health status for pig meat could be under extreme threat. At the same time progress on definitive product labelling 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10497"> laws has been too slow, particularly where imported ingredients are involved. However, I am impressed by recent assurances from the new Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) that that will be done quickly, and I hope that it will happen in the next couple of weeks. Australian pig producers are still recovering from a long and damaging drought and industry restructuring is not yet completed. They need more time to recover, to cope with attendant structural pressures and to be truly competitive with imports, particularly those from countries enjoying export subsidies and import tariff quotas, like Denmark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the industry&mdash;and this is an important point&mdash;is not arguing against freer international trade under WTO principles, not unreasonably it is seeking a competitive breathing space. I agree with the Pork Council of Australia that governments, state and federal, need to fast&hyphen;track quality assurance measures and country&hyphen;of&hyphen;origin labelling laws together with a well&hyphen;funded and targeted industry adjustment and development package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke this morning once again to the chief executive of Darling Downs Bacon, Robin Ferris, who made the point&mdash;and I think I have to voice these concerns in this place today&mdash;that the decisions by the government recently are disappointing and not helpful to the domestic pork industry. Mr Ferris said that the government decision, coming at a time when the Toowoomba Food Cooperative was conducting a feasibility study into the construction of a world's best practice export accredited abattoir in the Darling Downs region, introduced a range of additional factors into the equation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He went on to say that it is important that, while the government claimed its structural adjustment package and decisions on imported pig meat were consistent with Australia's international obligations, the government had a domestic obligation to ensure that Australian primary industry had reciprocal access to overseas markets on similar generous terms to those provided to foreign producers wishing to do business in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Ferris went on to say that it was ironic that, while the Queensland state government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was negotiating with and encouraging the grower owned cooperative to expand its abattoir and pig meat processing facilities, the federal government, seemingly, was exposing the Australian industry to serious damage. He finished by saying that cheap, subsidised imported pig meat would continue to lower domestic prices and have a disastrous flow-on effect on associated industries, particularly the grain industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of criticism. There was criticism in Queensland <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Life </EMPHASIS>last week and I have had a number of letters from local people. The bottom line to the whole situation is that in the view of a lot of people the timing was wrong, both in that it was in the lead-up to Christmas and in that it was insufficient in terms of restructuring the industry and, whilst people are not against imports, it is not a one-way street, and seemingly that is what is happening at the moment. Whilst exports need to be strong, exports can only be as strong as the domestic base. In the view of a lot of people the $10 million package that has been approved is woefully inadequate. Finally, quality assurance question marks persist. I commend the minister to move quickly in that direction. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10497"><TITLE>Greenhouse Gases</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the forthcoming third conference of the parties to the framework convention on climate change in Kyoto next month, where the issue of legally binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries will be on the table, the position adopted by the Australian government sets it apart from virtually all other developed countries. Australia's position is that it does not accept the concept of uniform greenhouse gas emission reduction targets as most developed countries are proposing. It argues for negotiated differentiated targets on the basis of the same per capita economic cost to all countries. Alone amongst all the developed countries, it does not accept at the outset that any adopted targets should be legally binding. And alone amongst developed countries it argues that Australia could only accept a target which allows some increase in emissions over 1990 levels. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10498">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has adopted this position because its says that we are in a unique position as a fossil fuel intensive economy which would mean that the economic costs to Australia of adopting the European position of a 15 per cent cut in 1990 level emissions by 2010 or even the US position of stabilising emissions at 1990 levels by 2008&hyphen;2012 would be exceptionally burdensome for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on modelling by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, ABARE, the government claims that a target of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions at the 1990 level by 2010 would reduce Australia's GDP by 1.5 per cent by 2010, reduce gross national expenditure, which takes into account changes in the terms of trade, by 2&half; per cent, cost each Australian $9,000 in lost income over the period 2000 to 2020 and cause the loss of up to 90,000 jobs in the resource industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before looking more closely at the modelling on which these claims are based, there are a number of points to make about these claims of economic impact. Firstly, in regard to the impact on GDP, it should be understood that this is not a reduction in the growth rate of GDP but in the actual level of GDP. It is saying that, under a business as usual approach without greenhouse gas emission targets, if we had GDP growth of 3&half; per cent per annum then the GDP level we would have reached by December 2010 would not be achieved with emission targets until the end of April 2011, that is, four months later. This is hardly a devastating impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly the impact on gross national expenditure is greater with the GNE level being postponed a few months more. But much of this additional impact, and indeed some of the impact on GDP, is unavoidable whatever Australia does if other developed countries adopt targets which reduce their demand for coal, thereby reducing demands for our exports of coal and also reducing the price at which that coal can be sold. Such costs can only be avoided if nobody adopts any targets at all, that is, if all the nations ignore the developing problems of climate change. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should also be noted in this context that, according to ABARE's calculations, other countries are worse affected than Australia. Japan's GDP is said to be cut by two per cent by 2010 compared with Australia's 1&half; per cent. New Zealand's gross national expenditure is reduced by 5&half; per cent by the year 2020 compared with Australia's 3&half; per cent. So, according to the government's principal adviser on this issue, Australia is not in the unique position of being more heavily affected  than any other country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost to each Australian of an average $9,000 between 2000 and 2020 is not an annual loss by that time; it is the net present value of the cumulative loss over a 20&hyphen;year period. But during that time real incomes would have increased markedly. With growth of GDP at 3&half; per cent per annum there would be about an 80 per cent increase in real income per head by 2020. So the accumulated loss has to be set against the accumulated gain of many times the $9,000 due to rising real incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the 90,000 job loss claim stems from a survey conducted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in May and June of this year of potential resource projects valued at over $100 million and under consideration to proceed in the next five years or so. This showed $68 billion worth of projects. If all went ahead they would increase employment by 90,000. The claim that up to 90,000 jobs could be lost by accepting uniform emission targets is based on the assumption that none of these projects would then proceed. But, as DFAT itself admitted in its paper `Australia and climate change negotiations', if business continued as usual:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unclear how many of these projects would actually proceed to the construction stage.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The claim of 90,000 jobs lost assumes that they would all have gone ahead under business as usual but that none would go ahead if emission targets were applying. Both these assumptions are extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, with targets applying, it is hard to understand why some of these projects would not proceed&mdash;especially as almost half of them are in oil and gas extraction and processing. Since they would be mainly gas, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10499"> of which Australia has an abundance and which emits much less greenhouse gas than coal, it would surely be the case that these gas projects would be extremely likely to go ahead because the economics of gas compared with coal would be considerably improved by the imposition of greenhouse gas emission targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to jobs it should also be noted that the government and the DFAT paper have nothing to say about the number of jobs that would be created by the imposition of emission targets in the renewable energy industry and in the energy efficiency conservation area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the very economic modelling that provides the basis for these claims that are being made by the government is itself questionable. There are a number of reasons why this is so. Firstly, ABARE's assessments of the economic costs involved in reducing greenhouse gases to meet a target are based on comparing a projected business as usual economic outcome with the economic outcome if emission targets have to be met. But in establishing its business as usual scenario it makes no allowance for future energy savings of the no regrets, cost&hyphen;effective type that are increasingly being developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bizarre approach, given that the government is continually trumpeting the supposed effectiveness of the greenhouse challenge program under which companies agree to voluntarily change production processes or make new investments that considerably reduce projected greenhouse gas emissions. By not including such measures in business as usual scenarios, ABARE overstates the business as usual emission level and therefore increases the cost of reaching an emission target. Then in assessing the cost of reaching an emission target ABARE makes no allowance for additional energy saving technological change that would be induced by emission abatement measures. Again this is a bizarre assumption that defies reality and increases the cost of reaching an emission target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, what ABARE has done is paint a worse case scenario. This is especially so since it ignores the possibility of a con 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> siderable reduction in greenhouse gas emissions without substantial cost by restricting land clearing activities in marginal broadacre country, particularly in Queensland. Land clearing accounts for about 20 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions&mdash;with about 650,000 hectares cleared in 1990, most of which was in Queensland, where there are no restrictions on the clearing of freehold land. It is therefore a major source of greenhouse gas emission in Australia which should be relatively easy to reduce if governments were minded to do so. But no account of this is taken in the ABARE model; all the reduction in emissions is achieved by use of a high carbon tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, no account is taken in the ABARE model of the economic costs through induced climate change of continuing to do business as usual. The fact is that, if the over 2,000 eminent scientists in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are right, we do not have the option of continuing to do business as usual without incurring considerable economic costs through increasing environmental impacts on our economy. A business as usual scenario that ignores these costs, as ABARE does, is just unreal. Also, a business as usual scenario may not be open to Australia in a world where other developed countries are adopting emission targets. They may well take the view that, if Australia is trying to have a free ride while they are adjusting their economies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, then we should be subject to some adverse action such as trade sanctions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the ABARE model seems to drastically underestimate the likely use of gas to produce electricity in the future in estimating its business as usual scenario. Time prevents me from developing this point, but it is a very important part of the whole debate. Thirdly, as the DFAT paper makes clear, the adoption of some flexibility mechanism such as an emission trading scheme and joint implementation would very considerably reduce the economic costs of meeting targets for Australia and other countries. Indeed, those cuts could be of the order of 50 or 60 per cent for each of these flexibility mechanisms.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10500">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, it is important to note that the ABARE model is not accepted by other countries. The USA Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs and President Clinton's senior climate change adviser, Tim Worth, said this year that he did not understand Australia's position after the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had been there and explained it to him. The US has a model which shows that the impact on Australia would be much less than for Japan, the European Union and Canada. Japan, which ABARE's model says would be worse affected than Australia, has adopted a target of a five per cent reduction in 1990 levels by year 2000. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10500"><TITLE>Aircraft Noise: Sydney</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 4 December this year, the long&hyphen;term operating plan for Kingsford Smith Airport at Sydney comes into effect. This will result in a substantial reduction in flights over my electorate. This will become especially evident when mode 7 is redirected, which means that there will no longer be any northerly take&hyphen;offs over my electorate from the east&hyphen;west runway by flights that take off in a westerly direction. Additionally, a large number of flights taking off to the north will bank sharp left when they reach 800 feet, which means that they will be banking left at the aprons of Kingsford Smith Airport. The same will apply also to heavier planes when they reach 1,500 feet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret to say that Linda Morris's article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> is only partially right. In fact, by her omission of pertinent facts, it has managed to convey a totally wrong picture of what will occur after 4 December, and I told her so in a phone conversation this afternoon. If the situation over my electorate in regard to aircraft noise is as said by some of my political opponents, I draw their attention to at least one undeniable fact to debunk that mischievous myth, and that is that the property values in my electorate began to skyrocket when it became evident to astute and cost&hyphen;conscious property buyers that they will become even better off in regard to aircraft noise under the new reduced frequency flight paths when the long&hyphen;term operating plan comes fully into effect.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, a further substantial reduction in flights over the inner west of Sydney will occur only when a new international airport is built in western Sydney. All the major political parties realise that Sydney needs a second international airport. They realise that if this does not come about, then Kingsford Smith will simply grow larger and larger. Without a new airport, we can be certain that Sydney KSA will continue to expand. It would also need a fourth runway. Furthermore, you could be virtually assured that the movement cap would be filled for 17 hours a day&mdash;if that was not abolished entirely. It would mean that the bulk of these movements would be large commercial aircraft, with smaller aircraft diverted to Bankstown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The return to parallel runway operations would be inevitable and the noise around Sydney airport would become intolerable; even more so than it is at the present time in some areas of the inner west especially. We cannot pretend that if we just ignore this problem it will go away. Labor did that for 10 years and the noise only got worse. The fact is that no government, coalition or Labor, can afford to jeopardise the billions of dollars and the tens of thousands of jobs created by tourism. If that tourist trade is to survive, much less grow, we either need to expand KSA or build a new international airport immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Badgerys Creek site for the new international airport is not a new proposal. It has been both Labor and Liberal policy for the last decade. The Sydney Airport Community Forum, of which I am a member, which is the peak consultative body for government, industry and community consultations on air traffic arrangements, unanimously supported the construction with urgency of a major 24&hyphen;hour international airport at Badgerys Creek. I will just reiterate that point: SACF supported the building of Badgerys Creek unanimously. Up until this week, the Local Government Association also strongly supported Badgerys Creek. However, the LGA, which is controlled by Labor and Labor aligned councillors, has now felt the tug on the leash from Sussex Street and in a cynical political exercise has withdrawn its support.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10501">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are talking about cynical, hypocritical, populist vote buying, we cannot go past the Labor Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr. Make no mistake about it, Bob Carr and Brian Langton are more concerned about Labor's electoral survival in western Sydney than they are about solving the aircraft noise problem. For 10 years Labor supported the building of a new international airport at Badgerys Creek. They said it would provide much need jobs, business and infrastructure for the periphery of Sydney. But, now that the Howard government is actually planning to build the airport, Bob Carr and his cronies have suddenly changed their minds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bob Carr and the state ALP care more about retaining the marginal seats of Parramatta, Blue Mountains, Penrith and Badgerys Creek than they do about the one million residents around Sydney airport who are suffering with aircraft noise and associated pollution. The federal member for Watson (Mr McLeay) and the federal member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) support Badgerys Creek, as does the rest of the federal Labor Party. They know it is the right option. I note members opposite have the opportunity to interject but they have not taken up that opportunity, so by their silence I recognise their acquiescence. Bob Carr knows it is the right option as well. That is why his hypocrisy is so distasteful. This is what he had to say about Badgerys Creek in the past on at least four different occasions.

They say the area around the airport site is becoming increasingly urban, and this is absolute nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what the draft EIS for Sydney's second airport has to say about how many people will be affected by aircraft noise of 20 ANEC or more. In the year 2006, fewer than 2,000 people will be affected if option A is chosen, fewer than 5,000 people if option B is chosen and fewer than 1,500 people if option C is chosen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me reiterate: under the worst case scenario for airport noise in the year 2016, fewer than 7,000 people would be affected by 20 ANEC around Badgerys Creek airport. In other words, fewer people would be affected by noise from the whole of Badgerys Creek airport than are currently affected by either the east&hyphen;west runway or the main north&hyphen;south runway at Sydney KSA. Or, if you like, Badgerys Creek running at the noisiest option would be less inconvenient for the suburbs surrounding it than KSA was for the suburb of Drummoyne alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole issue can be resolved if we answer three simple questions which go to the heart of the matter. Do we need a new 24&hyphen;hour international airport for Sydney? The answer must be categorically yes. Is there currently a viable alternative for Badgerys Creek? Again, the categorical answer to that is that there is no viable alternative. Can we afford to spend another decade on site selection processes to try to identify another location and to do yet another environmental impact statement? The answer to that must be no.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is known as home to many nationalities, for a life of freedom from oppression, for the luxurious scenery and for the great spirit of the true blue Aussies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many people from around the world see this country as the land of new opportunities and change in lifestyle. Opportunities exist for all people to share the benefits that arise from the quality of our achievements and ideas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equal rights has been a controversial issue. People just don't seem to understand how easy and important it is to treat all men, women and children of all races and cultures with the same amount of dignity and respect that they would wish to be treated with. It should be our responsibility to take care of one another, helping all when help is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">People should learn to respect one another's culture and religion. They don't seem to consider the fact that without other nationalities, Australia would be boring. So it's about time Australians stopped being narrow minded and one sided. People should also be learning to respect each other, accepting others for who they are, taking the time to see what they have to offer, not only contributing to individual growth and development but to the country as a whole.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians should be realising the ability of tourism and trade to produce more money. This leads to the creation of more jobs. This means all Australians benefit from the freedom of choice to work and live in a wide open space comfortably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is known as a democratic country. We have the right of freedom of speech and the right to live in peace. The problem that has developed over recent years is that there is a little too much freedom of speech. This is not giving people who come to Australia from other nations a chance to show what they have to offer. People who migrate sometimes get degraded to a lower level of humanity because of their colour, race and religion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Different groups have the right to live as they please, but in a country as large as ours tolerance is necessary. This should be known as a place which they can now call home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many Australians wouldn't be able to handle being in a foreigner's shoes for a day. They couldn't imagine some of the pain and torture they go through each day of their lives. Australians couldn't imagine what it is or could be like to live in fear for their lives. Each day waking up, wondering when it will be their turn, whilst losing people around them for whom they care deeply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">People of other ethnic backgrounds have the right to live in our country which should be known as the land of freedom for all humanity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, Australia is very much a land of opportunity and freedom. All Australians whoever they are, should be sharing our glorious country. We have plenty to share for all people. Instead of concentrating on all of the negatives of other cultures living in Australia we should be realising all of the positives such as business, trade, cultural richness and also tourism. These are just a few of the wonderful things that foreigners have to offer Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many believe that God created all men equal. This unfortunately seems to be the one proposition some Australians are ignoring. Australians and new Australians have the right to live in peace and freedom no matter what their colour, race or religion.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Kristy Cooper's essay reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a great country, perhaps one of the best in the world. We are superb in a lot of ways, but we also have problems that bring us down. Unemployment is our biggest problem at the moment and needs to be solved quickly as it is a catalyst for other problems such as youth suicide and pollution. People need to realise that issues such as unemployment can be solved if federal, state and local governments plus the community itself unite to work towards solving our major issues. If a problem is ignored for long enough it will not go away by itself, rather it needs help. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10503">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we enter the 21st century we will need to approach the unemployment problem, with assistance from government at all levels, the private sector and most importantly, the aid and assistance of the community. If the government were to give more financial incentives, that is, less payroll tax and a fairer way of dealing out the national wealth, it would go a long way towards helping the private sector make more positions available. Perhaps ideas such as of job sharing, earlier retirement or more part time type of employment could be investigated. The community would have to accept some of these new formats without referring to the ways that we have done things in the past. They would need to accept that we need to have shorter working days which would mean that we would have less money, but this would be only for short term, as there would be more persons working we would have fewer people to support on social welfare systems. Therefore the government could set up new ways to add financial support to those wishing to set up their own business, which is another way of getting people into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Youth are the future of our country and we need to give them all the help we can. With these times of computers and technology based industries, secondary and tertiary schooling is vital. Government and private markets need to get together to assist with finding solutions. That will mean more money and the people and equipment needed to facilitate what our youth need. Not all of us want to be computer whizzes, doctors or scientists, therefore we need to be able to introduce our youth to the work place as soon as practical. It is absolutely useless asking for a 16 year old to be experienced for a certain position, they need training. Maybe we could set up trade related schools rather than the old system of apprentices and trainees. These schools would be funded by the trades and manufacturers that require the labour and by the community, via the government through taxes, perhaps a goods and services tax. Through such things as these we could prevent the current waste of our future through youth suicide and other self destructive activities. If the youth of Australia had something that they could aim for and be sure of obtaining, not just something that they may get if they are lucky, then the need for such useless crutches as drugs and alcohol would be lessened, if not forgotten completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the youth of this great country of ours is used in a meaningful way, we would eradicate problems they, as an idle population cause, like vandalism, which costs all of us great sums of money. There always will be a litter problem but with more people working we could use some of these people to work out better ways for recycling, employ task forces to maintain and get better and/or cheaper ways of heating. If just some of these ideas work towards establishing more eco 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nomically viable solutions to the pollution problems, we could sell these ideas or systems to overseas markets, reducing our debt, increasing wealth and also increasing our chances of a longer existence on this planet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a country we need to stick together to overcome our problems. It is absolutely useless if one of us comes up with an idea that will help it improve our situation, be it unemployment, social services, housing, poverty, youth suicide or pollution, if ten more of us sit around trying to put the idea down without even giving it a fair hearing. We also need to embark upon some new ideas to see if they will work. It seems useless to spend a million dollars on studies and commissions, when the idea may only cost ten thousand dollars to get up and running. If it doesn't work the Australian community have saved money, if it does work we all win: more employment; more money; and a greater standing in the eyes of the world. With more forethought and less arguing and fighting we could make this great nation of ours even greater than it is now. We all need to help each other out. Get rid of unemployment and we get rid of a large proportion of youth suicide. Protect our youth and they will protect our future.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10503"><TITLE>Community Values and Standards</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my grievance today I want to make an appeal to all levels of our society for leadership to protect our institutions and symbols, and to send a clear and unambiguous message to our young people that, as a nation, we have standards and limits of behaviour. Daily in our media, frequently in this place and&mdash;I doubt if other members' experience is any different&mdash;not infrequently in our electorates we lament the loss of values and the direction of our youth. But I wonder if this is the fault of youth or if these three groups I have mentioned&mdash;the parliament in its leadership role, the media in its commentator's role or the community in its value system&mdash;are to blame for the mixed and inconsistent signals they send out to our youth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a great deal of debate raging in our community regarding drugs. On the one hand there are those who would strengthen surveillance and beef up our prison sentences while on the other hand there are those who propose heroin trials, shooting galleries, counselling and decriminalisation of certain drugs. Some might agree that the two concepts are not necessarily in conflict, but our young people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10504"> are left with no sense of where the boundaries are and where our national vision for them might be in a drug free Australia. To the extent that the recent national illicit drug strategy outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) addressed those matters of education, research and the like, I very much commend it; but I feel the certainty of a wider national vision is necessary. We must, for the sake of our young, extend these matters well beyond prevention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approach to the X&hyphen;certificated videos leaves a lot to be desired. Sadly, this grubby trade has become part of the revenue base of the ACT and the Northern Territory. It raises $34 million a year for the two governments. While I am not an advocate of general censorship, I believe there need to be constraints and limits, especially in those sections of the media, be that print or electronic or film, that have demonstrated a lack of self&hyphen;regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A public which has been promised the elimination of X&hyphen;certificated material has the right to expect that it would be so and that this substandard trade in pornography would not be allowed to flourish under a mollified classification of non-violent erotica. The presumption is that, if you remove violence out of the equation, then somehow it is all right. That says nothing of the demeaning of women. It says nothing of the role the exposure of this type of erotica plays in sex crimes&mdash;a point clearly made by Canada's Fraser Commission on Pornography. It also says nothing of the fact that the retention of the NVE certificate gives this substandard sleaze the economies of scale to survive and push its tentacles out by way of postal services into other states. What message does this send to our kids about the standards being set for them by our society?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are currently involved in a debate on the future of our democracy as to what type of republic or monarchy we want. Let me take you back just a couple of years to the statue `Down by the lake with Liz and Phil'. Another level of standards was assaulted, as much by indolence as by anything else. Young people must have wondered whether this was smart, artistic, offensive, debasing of our institutions or whatever. There was no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> clear leadership or message from government. This none&hyphen;too&hyphen;exciting attempt at sculpture was a thinly veiled representation of our head of state and her consort in the nude. Hardly a great work of art, it was a great vehicle for ridicule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether one is a monarchist or a republican, it should not have eluded us that it was not the individuals who were being ridiculed but our own institutions. The sculpture stayed there for several days with various weirdos and vandals being attracted to it. I pose the question: what would have been the public's reaction and the government's action if, for argument's sake, the sculpture had depicted a nude head of state and spouse from one of our northern neighbours? I suspect there would have been outrage. It would have been removed in a matter of hours, there would have been a flurry of diplomatic activity, and profuse apologies to the country involved would have followed. Those heckling know this only too well. However, this is not the case for our own institutions; they are open season. I ask again: what sort of message does that send out to a younger generation groping for values?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the Serrano photographic exhibition in the National Gallery of Victoria. It is one thing to take the mickey out of the pomposity of the clergy, as Dave Allen was wont to do in his TV programs, but it is totally different to depict the foremost symbol of Christianity in an immersion of urine. We have no established religion, quasi or otherwise in this country, nor would I advocate it for one moment. Yet it would be fair to say that many of our laws, our legislative procedures, the conduct of our universities and our military traditions all have their genesis in the Christian tradition or, more broadly, in the Judaeo-Christian tradition. While this should not be lorded over citizens who are atheist, humanist or from other religious traditions, it is entitled to be treated with equal respect. I ask for no more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the House will recall the unfortunate incident during the Gulf War in 1990 when sailors from the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Success</EMPHASIS> in a navy sanctioned video were shown in a light&hyphen;hearted, if not insensitive, mock religious 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10505"> ceremony. This caused great offence to Arab nations and brought a swift response in the form of an apology from the navy. I have no argument with this. If a particular religion or tradition was offended, then an apology is appropriate. As a cartoonist from my area found to his surprise, he was chastised for stereotyping Jewish businessmen in a cartoon. Again, this is quite appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To go further, we have rightly seen David Irving excluded from obtaining a visa to this country because we believe his views offend the Jewish people, in particular, and humanity at large in his false treatment of the holocaust. All these actions are seen as reasonable. They demonstrate to the young and old alike that there are constraints and limits to human behaviour when it grievously offends sections of our society. That makes the exhibition of the Serrano depiction of a crucifix in urine all the more incomprehensible. What could be more offensive to 70 per cent of our population, who profess Christianity as their belief system in a census, than such a photograph?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is worse, the National Gallery of Victoria is heavily subsidised from the public purse. It first vehemently defended this exhibition and then, after two acts of vandalism, closed it citing weakly the risk of harm or even fatality. What sort of director of any art gallery in Australia would allow his patrons to be even put in that position if he thought such a photograph would provoke such public and community reprehensible treatment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seldom disagree with judges, but I have found Justice Harper's rejection of Archbishop Pell's claim of blasphemous libel hard to reconcile. His contention was that there was no church&hyphen;state relationship in Australia&mdash;as distinct from the English situation&mdash;and that this removed the circumstance in which blasphemy could occur. I find that very hard to accept. I would have thought that the concept of blasphemy existed regardless of the church-state relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find nothing more offensive than the prime symbol of the Christian religion being treated in a plainly profane and degrading way. Did our leaders speak out? Yes, they did. A premier spoke out to defend the gal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lery&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;and the media went into a frenzy to try to justify it. Again I ask: what signal does this send out to our young who are searching for truth and certainty in our society?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was talking to a priest in my electorate the other day who had just come back from a pilgrimage. He said that he noticed a mood change in young people; that they had gone away from the idea that they had to be treated with warm and fuzzy concepts. He came back with a distinct feeling that young people were looking for certainty and the hard and historic truths of society and religion. They are not going to get them from the sort of mumbo jumbo that we have had here over recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude on something that I found very profound this morning at the national prayer breakfast in Charles Colson's address. He said, in a paraphrasing of youth, `You've taken away the rules and we'll do what we want.' What a terrible heritage to hand to our children.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R152">Legislative Instruments Bill 1996</XREF>  will implement the most significant reform of the delegated legislation process since Federation. It expands and enhances the parliament's supervision and control over legislative instruments. Successive governments have accepted the desirability of redressing the balance between the executive and the parliament to increase the role for parliamentary scrutiny of delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has had a long history. The first recommendation for such legislation was put forward in 1992 by a report of the Administrative Review Council under Professor Cheryl Saunders. Since that time there has been a very large measure of bipartisan support for the necessary reforms it proposes both within this House and the Senate. However, as previously noted by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) in the Main Committee on 11 September 1996, this is not a bill which could be described as sexy or as likely to excite public interest. Nonetheless, the bill is important. It matters and it will impact directly on the machinery of government and the interaction between the citizen and the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of this House do not need to be reminded that we live in an age where the volume of legislation passed by parliamentary processes continues to expand. The difficulty for the public is knowing exactly what laws apply to their circumstances. There is a pressing need to do something about the proliferation of subordinate legislation. This bill, while increasing accountability to parliament, will also dramatically improve the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10511"> public's accessibility to the laws which apply to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has undergone significant reworking since it was first presented to the House in 1994. It has been the subject of in&hyphen;depth analysis by both House and Senate committees. It incorporates the commitments that the government made as part of our policy statements on law and justice and a new deal for small business. The bill contains a definition of legislative instrument which provides greater certainty as well as subjecting a wide range of instruments to parliamentary scrutiny which have previously been exempt. The bill ensures that only instruments registered with the federal register of legislative instruments maintained by the Attorney-General's Department are enforceable. The bill requires mandatory consultation for instruments to ensure that delegated legislation is necessary and relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for sunsetting of delegated legislation, the bill increases the power of the parliament to scrutinise subordinate legislation and the bill requires instruments to be lodged with the parliament within six sitting days, not the current 15 days, accompanied by an explanatory statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill and the government's amendments contain some exemptions to the normal operation of the bill. I will deal with those exemptions when I come to move the government amendments. The amended bill which we propose to pass today is the version of the Legislative Instruments Bill  which the government is ready and committed to implementing as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me be very clear on this for the benefit of both the House and the Senate, which will shortly receive this a second time. The government is fully committed to the passage of these important reforms. The machinery to handle these new arrangements within the Public Service have been largely implemented. However, the government will not accept, and consequently nor will we implement, a modified form of the  Legislative Instruments Bill  which does not reflect the government's policy determination of what is the appropriate balance between the parliament and the executive. We recognise that other views will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exist and subsequent governments may take a different opinion on what the balance should be. That is their right, but as the government we have the responsibility of implementing the legislation that we believe is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have carefully considered and determined what are the appropriate boundaries between parliament's right to scrutinise subordinate legislation and the executive's right to government. Our assessment as government of the day is that in our bill, with the amendments we move today, we have achieved the right balance. The government calls on the opposition to support the early passage of the bill, for which there is general acceptance of the importance of the reforms it offers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), I do not have a photographic memory. It is getting to the stage where I am starting to have nightmares over the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996. I can recall that I did head the House of Representatives committee in the last parliament on which the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) was a member. Other members in this chamber were also members. We looked at this important legislation. As I said in the Main Committee, it is not sexy legislation but it is important legislation because it goes very much to the role of the executive and scrutiny by the parliament of executive action and regulatory action. It is a detailed and complicated bill and that is why there is a rider. I do not have a photographic memory and I cannot say that I am totally across the impact of some of these amendments, particularly the government amendments which will be moved later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pity that we did not get more notice because I can indicate obviously in relation to these 18 amendments&mdash;there are 18 amendments that the government has accepted from the Senate&mdash;that we will be supporting those amendments because they were amendments that the Labor Party called for in the Senate with the other minor parties. One-third of the amendments&mdash;18 out of 54&mdash;have been accepted by the government. Most of them are largely technical, and we think they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10512"> improve the bill in any event. That is obviously why the government picks them up as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We agreed to the procedure proposed by the Attorney-General earlier&mdash;that is, we will pick up the accepted amendments. Then there will be the other amendments that the government is not accepting and then there are fresh amendments. We did not get much notice of the fresh amendments. I will indicate at this stage that in relation to those amendments, the Labor Party will reserve its position until they get through to the Senate. I am going through those amendments at the moment. I might be able to give an indicator, but Senator Bolkus will detail our position on those later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What worries me about what the Attorney has just said is that there is a suggestion that if we insist on the other amendments that are to follow the government is going to hold the line on this. I think it is about time, with or without the subsequent amendments, this bill was passed. I can remember being in committees, and I can remember being in government, and saying that we were going to give it a start-up date of such and such. That date was deferred. We had a House of Representatives committee on the matter and the Senate has now looked at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do not believe that the other amendments the government is not accepting are so fundamental that the government needs to insist upon rejecting them to the stage that we will have a double dissolution trigger or that `It is all or nothing, we are only going to accept these 18 amendments'. I think some of the debate is at the margins. But I do welcome the fact that the government is accepting these 18 amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask the Attorney and his office to liaise with the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Bolkus, before this bill goes back into the Senate. It may well be that we can reach agreement on some of these other amendments and we might be able to sort some of this out. But I do know&mdash;and I will talk about that in the next round of amendments&mdash;that some of the other amendments we do regard as fundamental. I support these amendments that the government is now moving. They are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendments that we helped originate in the Senate. We believe they do improve the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not often I defend the Senate, but I just say, in terms of the so-called  vandalistic approach of the Senate in this instance, that part of the problem is that we are dealing with a complicated bill. I believe that those amendments that were moved by the minor parties in the Senate were moved in good faith.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, we have this problem, even this evening, where the government is moving amendments and the first we heard of them was a short time ago. I am not saying they are not amendments moved in good faith. But I think on a lot of these issues you would not get to the stage where you might be moving things in ignorance if there was communication from both sides. The onus is on the government because the government needs to sit down and explain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Legislative Instruments Bill  has a long history. No-one can say that either side of the parliament has been trying to frustrate it. I know that the then opposition were attempting to be constructive. I know that a number of things have happened since we were in government. I know that a number of those amendments were moved because they might have reflected a position that we took as a parliamentary committee that was not totally picked up by the government. When I chaired the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, my duty was to the parliament and not to the executive. Often we brought down reports where the executive was not too happy. We did not just turn around and rubber-stamp legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) that I know he might be a little frustrated in relation to this. But I think between now and when it gets to the Senate, if you say that some of the amendments are ill-conceived, I suggest that a process be set up to talk to honourable senators before it hits the Senate next time. The trouble is that there is no trust on both sides of the House at the moment. That is just a matter of a fact; that is calling 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it as it is. This is not about this Attorney. This is an honourable Attorney; the trouble is he cannot get his submissions up in cabinet because he gets rolled all the time. So he has to run briefs that he does not necessarily agree with, and he does it to the best of his ability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to these amendments that the government is now rejecting, this could become a repetitive debate. I do not have a photographic memory, so I concede that I am not fully across a lot of these amendments that were insisted upon by the Senate. But I say to the Attorney and his officers that Senator Bolkus, who has carriage of this matter in the Senate, and the other senators should be consulted before it goes back to the Senate. I fear that as a result of the Attorney's comments senators might, quite rightly, want to dig their heels in and say, `We don't believe our amendments are vandalistic, and it's up to the government to prove that they shouldn't be pursued.' I just give that caution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that the government has the numbers in the House of Representatives, so I will not be calling a division. I just put on the record that Senator Bolkus will continue to have carriage of these amendments in the Senate, and I suggest to the Attorney and his office that lines of communication be opened up between them and Senator Bolkus and other senators before these amendments hit the Senate. This debate did occur in the Senate. The Senate is not a chamber that will just rubber stamp government proposals. It is just like the situation with the native title bill. We know that the government is sitting on advice that it is in breach of its international obligations. Table the advice. Let us have some transparency. You say that these amendments do not improve the bill. If there is material that you can convince the opposition of, we will look at it on its merits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not an ideologically driven set of amendments. These amendments were moved in the Senate by all the minor parties in good faith. I do not believe it is a vandalistic approach. I do not believe in the approach that automatically the Senate or this House should just rubber stamp everything in the executive. I know that the Attorney-General's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10514"> Department officers have a more generous view of some of the proposals than do Prime Minister and Cabinet, Treasury or some other departments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to reply briefly to some of the things that the member for Banks (Mr Melham) has said. One of the problems with communicating with the opposition in relation to matters like this is that there is no communication in this House at all. When the bill was debated we did not know what the opposition, the Labor Party, position was on the bill. It is the regular practice of the Labor Party in this House simply to defer to the Senate and, in particular in matters affecting my portfolio, to whatever Senator Bolkus might do. If Senator Bolkus does not get his act together, we never know for the duration of a debate in this House what the Labor Party's position is. In fact, on this particular issue we did not know what the Labor Party position was even when the matter came on for debate in the Senate. The Labor Party, regrettably, simply does not have its act together, and Senator Bolkus in particular seems to be incapable of forming an opinion on a matter in relation to sensible proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give a couple of examples of the sort of vandalistic approach that I suggest has been adopted. Very extensive consideration was given by the House of Representatives committee in relation to the 1994 bill on the subject of sunsetting, and the unanimous report accepted what was proposed by the then government. Without reference to the government, the Labor Party eliminated the sunset provision. What is going to happen? We do not know what is going to happen because it was not dealt with by Senator Bolkus in the debate. It was simply a motion to delete the relevant provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another provision that was deleted in the Senate was the exemption in relation to national schemes of legislation. There is no arrangement in place as between jurisdictions 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that would enable the operation of this bill to deal with national scheme legislation. But that did not stop the opposition in the Senate simply eliminating the exemption, leaving no machinery in place. That is vandalism and it is reprehensible. If the opposition wants to be taken seriously and to be communicated with, that sort of approach must stop.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments are in fact simple replicas of amendments that were moved in the Senate and rejected. The purposes of the amendments are to provide an exemption from disallowance for legislative instruments other than regulations made under the provisions of parts 1, 2 or 9 of the Migration Act or of regulations made under that act. They are to continue the exemption from the act of instruments determining particular terms and condi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10516"> tions for persons employed in the public sector, members of the defence forces and members of the Australian Federal Police but at the same time preserve the present provisions for parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance for some instruments which are statutory rules. The amendments effect minor technical and drafting changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal amendment is No. 1 relating to the Migration Act. The amendment is to meet the government's policy objective of maintaining the status quo of no disallowance for a range of migration control instruments that might otherwise be disallowable as a consequence of the enactment of the bill, but it does not extend the range of instruments to which the exemption from disallowance applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other principal amendments are Nos 4, 5 and 6, relating to the public sector employees. Amendment No. 4 makes a number of drafting changes to remove unintended limitations to the range of instruments that are not legislative instruments for the purposes of the bill. It is to be noted that, although the making of such instruments does not require compliance with the provisions of the bill, the current requirements for tabling and disallowance of some such instruments under other legislation are respectively maintained by other amendments.</PARA>

The summary of the document says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this report is not for the Committee, with the benefit of perfect hindsight, to be critical of the state of physical security in the NCA's Adelaide office prior to March 1994. It will properly be the role of the Coroner to examine the matter . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is reporting to the Parliament its concern about the failure of the NCA to provide it with a fully reliable explanation of the state of security prior to the bombing. Given its statutory role as the body that monitors and reviews the NCA on Parliament's behalf, the Committee was entitled to expect that the advice received from the NCA in October 1996 was reliable. Committee members are embarrassed to now learn that advice which they had specifically sought . . . was fundamentally flawed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The circumstances of the operation of the NCA are subject to some controversy. By and large, members of the committee actively support the National Crime Authority having the special powers that it needs to carry out its vital work on behalf of the Australian community. Part of the trade-off for those special powers conferred on the National Crime Authority is its accountability to this parliament and its accountability for the accuracy of the information it provides to the committee of this parliament that has been established to monitor it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not, as I said before, intend to go into the specifics. I will leave it to the member for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Moore to outline briefly the specifics of where the committee is concerned that it was provided with inaccurate information. The facts are that it is important when occasions like this arise&mdash;particularly with an organisation that does have special powers on behalf of the community, special powers that extend beyond those available to a normal law enforcement agency&mdash;that, commensurate with those special powers, considerably higher standards of accountability are required to ensure that balances are preserved. That is why the committee on this occasion has come into the parliament to draw to the parliament's attention that it has had a situation where the advice it has received has been less than adequate. I simply refer, in conclusion, to the final point in the summary:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament is informed that the Committee will be pursuing in detail with the Authority its explanation as to how this incident and such a gross misleading of the Committee could have occurred.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Security at the Adelaide office of the National Crime Authority in 1994</EMPHASIS> , tabled on behalf of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, is provided to the parliament under subsection 55(1)(b) of the National Crime Authority Act, which places on the committee a duty to inform the parliament of any matter appertaining to the authority or connected with the performance of its functions to which, in the committee's opinion, the attention of parliament should be directed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, I would like to stress, as did the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), that this is not a report about the investigation of the bombing which took place at the NCA's offices in Adelaide in March 1994, which led to the tragic death of my former colleague Western Australian Detective Sergeant Geoffrey Bowen and the injuring of NCA lawyer Peter Wallis, who suffered the permanent loss of an eye. It is a report about 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10521"> the committee's expectations that, if it is to be able to effectively undertake its statutory duties, it should be able to rely on the advice of the NCA on matters of such importance as the level of security which was in place in the NCA's Adelaide offices at the time of the bombing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report sets out advice it received from the NCA immediately after the bombing in 1994, in 1996 and, most recently, last month. The committee held a public hearing with the then NCA Chairperson, Tom Sherman, a little over one month after the bombing, essentially to seek answers to such critical questions as: how could such a thing happen at arguably Australia's prime organised crime&hyphen;fighting organisation? What security measures were in place to protect the lives of NCA personnel from such threats? Were they considered adequate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time, the committee was reluctant to push the NCA too hard for answers, to avoid any suggestion of interference in the South Australian Police Service's investigations and any subsequent jury trial or coronial inquiry. There was also a concern that, if the poor state of the NCA security system were given wide broadcast, such information could be put to use by those with a grudge against the authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Sherman was frank in his admissions to the committee about the state of security in Adelaide, and he indicated that the incident had prompted considerably increased attention to be paid to physical security issues. He informed the committee that the level of security was in line with what prevailed in similar law enforcement bodies at the time, but which was now recognised as deficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These relatively brief admissions met with the committee's acceptance at the time. The committee naturally expected early progress with the police investigation and an early prosecution. Now, three years later, and still no prosecution, we know better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report outlines how last year the committee received information, from a source other than the NCA, that there were a number of security reports, both internal and by ASIO, which stressed that the NCA's security in Adelaide was deficient. The knowledge of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those reports, and the lack of management action on them, was naturally a cause of concern for employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee put a number of questions to the NCA and received the advice of current NCA Chairperson, Mr John Broome, in October 1996. Mr Broome informed the committee that there had only been one report, which related to the consideration of x-ray screening equipment, which was not acted upon for size and cost reasons. However, after revelations in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last month, in articles written by Jamie Walker, Mr Broome provided updated advice to the committee to the effect that there had been several protective security reviews undertaken in the years prior to the bombing. These indicated that the need for physical security improvements was well and truly recognised but, mainly for funding reasons, no purchases of better equipment were made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are all wise after the event, and the committee is not seeking, with the benefit of perfect hindsight, to be critical of the state of security of the NCA's Adelaide offices. The intent of this report of the committee is to inform the parliament of the committee's concerns that it was given by the NCA less than reliable information, the accuracy of which it had relied on in subsequent dealings&mdash;and relied on by its members with constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee will pursue the issue with the NCA at an early opportunity to seek to establish what went wrong. These are the questions that require answers: did the chairperson of the NCA act solely on the advice of officers in the NCA's Adelaide office? If so, has he lost their confidence, or was there a simple oversight of relevant material during a period of high workload? Why did no-one notice the errors in the advice to the committee until the media reports? Have the budget cuts so lessened efficiency in the NCA's regional offices that there is now no institutional memory?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More fundamentally, the incident demonstrates that, if the committee is to effectively perform the functions asked of it by the parliament, it must be able to access the NCA's confidential documentation, rather 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10522"> than having to rely on NCA advice. This issue has been a bone of contention with the NCA since the earliest days of the committee's operations, and it seems likely that only an amendment of the statute will put the matter beyond doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would add to that by saying that, having been a member of the committee since 1990, I am well aware of the history of the relationship between the committee, the NCA and the legislation that governs the committee's activities. Time after time the committee, in all its previous incarnations, has recommended to the then government that there ought to have been amendments to the NCA Act in order for the committee to be able to more effectively do its job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, that matter has been ignored by governments of both complexions. That, of course, has led to the situation in which we are today with this report being tabled which, in effect, says that, having relied on the word or the information provided by the NCA, the committee has found itself to be in a position where the information was deficient and ought to have been better and, to a large extent, the committee has been misled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter of serious concern because, in the exercise of its powers, there are a number of areas of scrutiny, the most prominent of which is the work of the committee as the oversight body responsible for overlooking the activities of the NCA. Given those extraordinary powers, it is incumbent on the NCA to be forthright, open and accountable to the committee, within the bounds of the NCA Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On reflection, I believe that this report illuminates to the parliament the work of the committee, and I congratulate other members of the committee. This committee has gone to extraordinary lengths to try to act in the most forthright and rational way to ensure that the NCA does have that valuable oversight when exercising those extraordinary powers under its legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the articles which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 11 October it was pointed out that there was no security of the car park where the NCA officers left their vehicles. I cannot for the life of me understand how this state of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> affairs came to pass. It is extraordinary, considering we are dealing with some of the most hardened, desperate and dangerous criminals in Australia, that the NCA officers were obliged to park their vehicles in unsecured car parks where, presumably, these criminals, their colleagues or accomplices could have had access to the vehicles and done what they liked to damage them, alter them or placed devices in them that could have led to the death of the officers concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, with the benefit of hindsight it is easy to be clever. Nonetheless, there was a lack of security measures at the NCA Adelaide office. It was a matter of concern. The fact that we were given deficient information in the committee is a matter of more serious concern, something that I hope will be rectified. I hope that at the conclusion of our dealings with the NCA chairman we will have the fullest possible information with which to conclude our interest and our dealings in relation to what has been one of the most serious attacks on a law enforcement body in Australian history.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My starting point with the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 is to argue for welfare state reform. My assessment is that the design features of the post-war welfare state have in many respects become moribund. There is a new set of issues on the political agenda, serious issues of entrenched economic and social exclusion, that require strong elements of welfare state reform. I am one of those on the left of centre who believe in thinking the unthinkable when it comes to the future of the welfare state. But, having said that, this legislation represents a poor way to reform welfare. This legislation breaches each of the principles by which welfare state reform should be guided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The welfare state needs reforming. We need to move from a residual system of income support to whole-of-life support. We need to move from passive to active systems of welfare, active systems that empower citizens and develop skills and capabilities to deal with the challenges of a post-industrial society. We need to entrench a genuine two-way street of reciprocated responsibility, a system that encourages risk and rewards effort as well as providing those all important skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is not the way to go about those tasks. This legislation is the worst possible example of welfare state reform in the 1990s. It makes two fundamental errors that cast this legislation as a poor piece of public policy. The first is that it tries to defy diversity. One of the problems of the design of the post-welfare state has been that it has been based on the principle that one size fits all, that government is able to plan and provide for all citizens as if their needs were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> identical. That has been one of the historic failings of the welfare state as our society has become so much more diverse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation tries to treat all 18- to 20-year-olds as if their relationship with their parents was identical. The Minister for Social Security, Jocelyn Newman, in announcing this provision somewhat reminded me of someone who is recalling the circumstances of the Brady Bunch family&mdash;that every family in Australia would be happy, would be embracing solidarity and would have sound financial circumstances and constant contact between parents and their children. That is not the reality in Australia. As much as those who engage in acts of social engineering and who want to wind the clock back to the 1950s and 1960s might hope it would be otherwise, it is not the case. The prospects of this parliament redesigning the family unit in Australia are absolutely remote. There is no way back to the family unit of the 1950s and 1960s. There is only the way of government catering for and accommodating diversity. Government can no longer plan for a single family type and its needs in Australian society. Government needs to cater for and accommodate diversity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Diverse family arrangements are very much the reality in Australia in the current era, and will grow. If you look at all the statistical evidence, all the census material about the changing nature of family types in Australia, diversity is not only here; diversity is growing. There is no one single family type. There is no Brady Bunch model that the government can plan and provide for in Australia in the current circumstances. So to commence the parental means testing of unemployment benefits for 18- to 20-year-olds is a foolish measure which tries to take welfare principles back to the idea of one size fits all. One size no longer fits all when it comes to the diversity of Australian family types. Government needs to move into the enterprise of customising its support, to identify individual needs, to find the flexible systems of public provision which allow customisation to take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Senator Newman, as with so many other members of the coalition, lives in a fool's paradise, the fool's paradise of thinking that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10524"> every Australian family is like the Brady Bunch&mdash;they all dine together every night, they talk together, they share their money around, they look after each other in every conceivable circumstance. Some families are like that, and I wish them well; I grew up in one. But I also recognise that other families go through all sorts of social stress and pressures where, against their strongest emotions and most positive feelings, they cannot hold that unit together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government needs to recognise the diversity of those families in those circumstances and to customise its systems of income and social support to cater for such diversity. This measure of parental means testing of unemployment benefits for 18&hyphen;to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds will cause untold hardship around Australia. It will force people back into circumstances from which they hoped to depart. It will force families into circumstances which are not of their free choosing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why does the Liberal Party, a party that once had small `l' Liberal values where people had the right to choose their own circumstances in life, engage in these acts of social engineering? Why impose your own values upon all other citizens? Why not have the decency and the liberty in our society to allow people at the age of 18 to 20 years old to make choices that, in other circumstances, government would allow them to make? These are young Australians who in some circumstances go to fight in wars. They are young Australians who are expected to take the responsibility of voting and who are treated under the laws of this land as adults. But they are not, under this provision, young Australians who have the freedom to achieve and choose their own circumstances in the relationship that they have with their parents if they are unfortunate enough to be unemployed. This is a regrettable piece of legislation for that reason alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that, there is a second breach of the sound principles of welfare state reform. This legislation is taking away a form of income support without substituting other forms of social opportunity. And that is a fundamental breach of sound welfare reform. We should not be taking away support without creating 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> new opportunities. I had an interesting reminder of this and also of the folly of slogans in politics when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in question time was talking about mutual obligations. This is a Prime Minister who has no history but who is fairly intent on trying to lay claim to a concept `reciprocated responsibility' which in Australian public policy started in Working Nation in 1994. Since then it has been developed in the United States, Britain and elsewhere. It is a long way round for John Howard to think that he has invented this concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Be that as it may, the concept itself deserves serious scrutiny&mdash;not the sort of scrutiny it received from Glenn Milne in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> article this morning, which the Prime Minister was happy to quote. From time to time Glenn Milne is remarkably well informed, but this is not one of those occasions. It is a poorly informed piece which essentially takes a slogan `mutual obligation' and does not look under the surface or scratch around and examine the sorts of mutual obligations and systems of public policy that might flow from it. There is one reality in public life, and that is slogans never make for good policy, for good journalism or for good public policy analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You need to understand that there are many forms of mutual obligation that government might apply. In my understanding of these issues I would try to define a negative form of mutual obligation and a positive form. The negative, of course, is the coalition way of taking away social support without replacing it with social opportunity. That is what this government is doing in this legislation for 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds&mdash;taking away the unemployment benefit without  replacing it with an expansion of the education and training system. It is taking away support without replacing it with opportunity. That is the negative path of the coalition in its reform of welfare and its understanding of mutual obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the basic question: where is the mutuality in government saying to young people, `I'm taking something away from you'? That is not a mutual exchange. There is no reciprocation in that. That is government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10525"> exercising the worst form of coercion and authority in welfare reform that could possibly be exercised. It is not a mutual obligation for government to tell people what to do. This is why the Labor Party's positive sense of mutual obligation is so important. It says that the mutuality lies in government taking away a benefit and replacing it with opportunity. The mutuality comes from government in this instance trying to minimise the number of young Australians on unemployment benefit and move them into the benefits of education and training to deliver the skills of lifelong learning and opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the difference. This is more than a slogan `mutual obligation' that can be bandied around this chamber and elsewhere. It is a serious item of public policy that deserves serious analysis. And a serious journalist would conclude that there is a vast difference between the coalition and the Labor Party on this particular question&mdash;the negative obligations imposed by the coercive powers of the coalition government as opposed to the Labor Party's positive path of building opportunity as a substitute for transfer payments. Our positive sense of responsibility was perfectly reflected in Working Nation. That was not a program that decided to take away benefits from Australians without at the same time replacing them with a raft of labour market programs and opportunities for education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the difference. This legislation is to be condemned for its failure to create any worthwhile form of opportunity as a substitute for the abolition of the unemployment benefits for 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. This is a government that has reduced university grants by $840 million and abolished some 21,000 growth places around the Australian university sector. This is a government that has cut TAFE funding by $250 million and each year 60,000 Australians are missing out on a TAFE course&mdash;equivalent to half the people in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, missing out on their entry to a TAFE course. It is also a government that has made a $270 million cut to government schools through the enrolment benchmark adjustment and a further $400 million cut indirectly through the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth's reduction of financial assistance grants to the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how can this government for one moment pretend that it is broadening the horizons of lifelong learning? How can this government possibly pretend that for all those young Australians taken off the unemployment benefit there is a viable alternative being created in education and training? If the figures from the budget documents are not stark enough, then I present to the parliament the advice the government itself has received from its own department. Earlier this year, before his coup d'etat on Senator Vanstone, the then Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, presented to the cabinet a departmental document that set out the information as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in retention rates will impact particularly in the government school systems.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students who remain at school as a result of the YA are likely to have characteristics similar to those students currently considered to be `at risk' of leaving school early ie: low levels of school achievement due to low literacy levels, family dislocation, itinerancy, violence or abuse, poverty, homelessness, truancy or substance abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To make schooling more relevant for these students, maintain their motivation and engage them in learning while minimising any disruption they may cause to other students, school authorities will need to expand the provision of VET in schools, involve industry in its delivery and develop specific programmes.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The departmental submission went on to conclude that some 27,000 young Australians would be forced back into the schools system because of this measure before the parliament, and this would make it incumbent upon the Commonwealth to provide funding of the order of $140 million to the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is the government failing to do that, it is wilfully negligent in its duties. The government made the decision to go ahead with the common youth allowance knowing that these would be the consequences. This was material that was before the Howard cabinet prior to its decision to move forward with a common youth allowance. So the government is not only taking away oppor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10526"> tunity and not only failing in the sound principles of welfare reform, it is doing it in a wilful fashion. It is happy to allow the states and territories to pick up the tab for this particular measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean in the schools sector, particularly the government schools of the states and territories? For every young Australian student studying hard right now, for every young Australian student sitting down at their desk doing their homework studying for an exam that might just be coming up, what they will get next year is fewer resources. This government is willing to see an extra 27,000 students&mdash;students who require higher unit expenditure in education&mdash;come back into the school system and is not willing to provide one extra cent for that purpose. So all those students working and studying hard now will get less, because the only way in which the states and territories can cope with this measure next year&mdash;they are the ones who will have to find the $140 million&mdash;is to take it out of existing programs. They will have to take it out of vocational education programs in the electorate of Longman and take it out of literacy programs in the electorate of Braddon, take it out of all the other school programs that are needed in every single electorate in every single part of the country. That will be the reality in 1998 because of this measure's enactment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the loss of resources; one also has to ask this question: if we don't provide the teachers and we won't provide the schools with the extra resources needed to cope with these special needs as students come back into the system, will there be disruption in the classroom? I think every educationist would tell you that that is likely. It is likely not because these are necessarily bad people coming back into the school system but because they have special needs&mdash;special needs identified in the government's own departmental submission.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of this measure will not be even around the country. It will be the weakest neighbourhoods with the highest unemployment which feel the greatest impact. It will be schools like those in Mount Druitt, and Campbelltown in my own electorate, that will have the concentration of students coming back into the school system. Of course, there are newspaper front pages this morning pointing out the spatial disparity in rates of unemployment around Australia. Unemployment is not evenly spread geographically. Some areas have a very high concentration of youth unemployment in particular. Those areas and their neighbourhood government school will struggle more than most to cope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just provide some of the statistics from my own state of New South Wales. In Mount Druitt, in the electorate of Chifley, there are 282 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who will be forced back to school because of this measure. They are presently unemployed. In my own electorate of Werriwa, in the suburb of Campbelltown there are 226 such students. Let us go to the North Shore of Sydney. In my absence recently I think the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) was crying poor about these things: `Don't beat up on the North Shore; we have the begging bowl out as much as anyone else.' In the suburb of Manly in the electorate of Warringah there are three unemployed 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who would be forced back into school; in Cammeray, one; in Killara, in the electorate of Bradfield on the North Shore, one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is such an uneven spread that one really does start to wonder how a high school in Campbelltown or Mount Druitt in the western suburbs of Sydney is going to cope. It is bad enough not to have the resources 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10527"> allocated by the Commonwealth, it is bad enough for teachers to have to cope with students who would rather not be there; but the concentration is enormous. Two hundred and eighty students in Mount Druitt is the equivalent of half a new high school. So where is the money coming from? Where is the commitment by the federal government to back up this common youth allowance with the education resources that provide learning opportunities?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no commitment&mdash;just cut after cut after education cut. What should we be doing? What we should be doing as a parliament and as a nation is to embrace Labor's positive path. With its positive sense of mutual obligation, Labor would be expanding education. Our historic task, whether it be the Whitlam, Hawke or Keating governments in the great continuum of Labor governance, is all about education expansion; it is all about broadening out opportunities through the power of lifelong learning. That is the record that we would be continuing in the next Beazley Labor government. That is our historic charter. It is needed in Australia more than ever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But not only do we need expansion and the historic broadening project in education but also, as I mentioned earlier, we need to cater for diversity. It is an interesting thing that, as people talk about the sorts of changes our society has been through in recent decades, most of the focus comes onto the economic. You would find that in most of the debates in the parliament as people talk about the movement from an industrial base of economic activity to post&hyphen;industrial or information age. But I have been looking at some material recently that has argued, I think persuasively, that many of the changes are as much social as economic. Some authors are talking about the movement from a traditional society to post&hyphen;traditionalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it makes sense. I think back to my own time growing up in the 1960s and 1970s. Young people in those postwar decades had most of their choices in life determined for them by the traditions of the family unit, community and society. The choices were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fairly well pinned down to the fact that women would not necessarily work; they would raise children in the home. A young male would probably aspire to the career path that his father held. Those are the sorts of traditions which society at that time embraced. But they are traditions now long past. They are traditions that are no more likely to return to Australia than the six o'clock swill or the FJ Holden. They are traditions that are part of an era gone by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For whatever reason, whether it is technological change, the power of education or changes in the values and attitudes in society, we need to recognise that we have moved very much into this post&hyphen;traditional era. Young Australian adolescents going through those sensitive years have a smorgasbord of choices ahead of them in life; not necessarily traditions which narrow and guide their path but all the choices that arise&mdash;from the information highway to the whole vast range of career opportunities they might pursue. This, of course, is one of the great causes of youth distress and problems in Australia, because in those sensitive years it is not always easy to cope with this smorgasbord of choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What positive role can government play in assisting that process? You can help people cope with change. You can help people learn and be educated to take their best choice in life, which is not necessarily learning off the curriculum or from a vocation but is often learning about life and for life. That has got to be the role of government in assisting young Australians to cope with this post&hyphen;traditional era of choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important to not only broaden education opportunities but cater for diversity. As I mentioned, not every school curriculum will fit all sizes. Not every school will be able to cater for the whole range of choices, values and inclinations that young Australians might hold. I know you involve yourself in these issues as well, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, and one of the interesting things I have found in my seven months as shadow minister with the responsibility for youth affairs is the immense, rich and enjoyable diversity of young Australians. Some of them are 13 going on 23 while others are 18 and just out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10528"> of nappies&mdash;with all the different values, moralities and aspirations that you might find in our pluralistic society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not think for a moment that the education system we constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, the so&hyphen;called comprehensive education system, can possibly cater for all that diversity. I believe there is a role for fundamentally rethinking many of the policies and programs we have in place for secondary schooling. It is often said that the major issues in schooling are literacy and numeracy in the primary school years. They are absolutely critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My suspicion is that the sleeping issue in education is in the secondary schools with the 13&hyphen; to 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who find themselves alienated from the formal school learning environment. Educationalists tell me that more males than females go through this experience, drop out of school and become the youth problem headline of tomorrow. We need to think about that difficulty and start catering for those diverse learning needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a great believer in setting a goal in public policy for secondary schools; that by catering for diversity every young Australian adolescent would be able to continue to engage in a positive learning experience. It might not be from the academic curriculum and it might not even be vocational. It might be in the creative arts, it might be something with their hands or it might be something that people of my generation have not even thought of. But we should be catering for those diverse youth needs and learning inclinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no general theory of learning in our society. There are many forms of intelligence and they express themselves in varied ways. The important thing is that if 13&hyphen; to 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds can engage themselves in a positive learning experience, they will value learning. They will want to continue a lifelong experience of learning in order to skill themselves up as much as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I had an excellent example of what this might mean in practice when I visited the Launceston Student Workshop in the electorate of Bass. It is a traditional manufacturing work environment where 14&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;old students&mdash;mostly males, but a couple of females&mdash;work in a very practical fashion. They do one week there, developing their practical skills, and one week back in the school. They are enriched by the experience. They are doing things in metal fabrication and woodwork that I would find beyond my horizons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My form of intelligence is different to theirs but I valued very much the excellence and passion that they brought to their work. I think it is a great example of how we should regard the school these days&mdash;as a hub of resources for traditional forms of learning with a whole series of learning and work experiences running off the hub to cater for diversity in learning inclination. We should have a student workshop of that nature in every town and suburb. We should have a creative area for the arts and multimedia, if that is what it takes. Let us cater for diversity as much as possible and totally rethink the attitudes that were brought to bear with the development of so&hyphen;called comprehensive schooling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor way is to create opportunity, not just by broadening but by accommodating this all&hyphen;important theme of social and learning diversity. Labor acknowledges that in the new economy there are few, if any, jobs available for unskilled teenagers. For this reason it is highly undesirable, both for society and for the recipients themselves, to have young Australians on unemployment benefits when they should be realising the benefits of education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor wants to see young Australians off welfare but not in the way being proposed by the government with its common youth allowance. To abolish unemployment benefits for 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds while slashing educational opportunities is the wrong way to reform the welfare state. This is the negative approach of a government more concerned with winding back the role of government than creating new opportunities through the possibilities of education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's approach reflects a positive commitment to the principles of reciprocal responsibility. That is the role of young Australians in making best use of the opportunities 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10529"> available to them in education and employment while also ensuring the government provides the essential public services that the private sector alone will not provide or maintain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why the ALP is determined to broaden the availability and range of opportunities in education and training, particularly for teenagers. While the Howard government has quarantined some parts of the Commonwealth budget from funding cuts, it has made education and training the major part of its fiscal consolidation program. The ALP's priorities could not be more different. Our first priority will be to invest in the skills and insights of the Australian people. Our starting point will be to ensure that beyond the mandatory years of education, and even before, all young Australians have a suitable range of education and training options available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the nature of some of the funding cuts which will be relevant with the implementation of the common youth allowance. I am always a little curious when I hear the minister for education, Dr Kemp, telling the parliament and other forums that it is not necessary to worry about the 40 per cent of young Australians who aspire to a university education. Normally in public life 40 per cent is a pretty decent share of society and its interests. I know the reason why Dr Kemp says that. He probably gets the same research information that the Labor Party gets about the damage the government has brought to bear with its university funding cuts, so I know why Dr Kemp would love to hear the Labor Party talk of nothing but non&hyphen;university education. That is not going to happen but, just the same, Dr Kemp needs to be brought to account in terms of his own record when it comes to TAFE and VET funding. He is a bit like the Prime Minister because he has no history. The minister comes to the parliament trying to position himself and parade himself as a broadener in education. I have gone to the trouble of checking his form, and I say: judge him by his deeds, not his words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at the pattern of Commonwealth outlays on vocational education when Dr Kemp was the head of Malcolm 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Fraser's prime ministerial office, between 1979 and 1982, in 1989&hyphen;90 prices. They fell from $422 million dollars to $398 million. He was there, the head of the Prime Minister's office, slashing the Commonwealth contribution to vocational education and training. And he is at it again. He is the minister with responsibility, since the last election, for a $250 million funding cut for TAFE. There are 60,000 young Australians who cannot find places. So he has got a real hide to talk about broadening access in areas where, under Fraser and under Howard, he has been the main slasher. He has been the Slasher Jack of education and training for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compare that to the record of the Hawke and Keating governments. On the same lists of funding in those 1989&hyphen;90 prices, when the Hawke government was elected in 1983, $414 million was spent on VET. When it lost the last election, in 1996, that figure had almost doubled to $717 million. So our record, in judging us by our deeds and not by our words, is firm. It is rock solid and diametrically opposed to Dr Kemp's record of cuts not once but twice&mdash;the great Slasher Jack of VET funding under Fraser and then Howard. Those things need to be placed on the record, as does the Labor Party' awesome concern about the provisions of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have tried to address the education and training consequences and set out Labor's positive alternative. I look forward to the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), my colleague, addressing some of the social welfare implications and some of the social distress that will be caused by this provision. I would certainly recommend to the House the amendment that has been moved on behalf of the Labor Party.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I get into the detail of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill, I think it is worth having a bit of a look at what the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is promoting here as far as the amendment is concerned. He says, `Whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading'&mdash;in other words, let us agree to give it support&mdash;`what we want to do is condemn the

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is quite pitiful. It `condemns the government for withdrawing support for 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in families with an income as low as $23,400 per annum'&mdash;that is just not the case; once again you have totally misrepresented it right from the start&mdash;and for `abolishing payments for 16&hyphen; to 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds while also slashing education funding, labour market assistance and job opportunities'. Once again that is not correct. If you happened look at the paper last week you would have found that 20 per cent of companies in Australia believe they are going to employ in the next 12 months, which is the highest rate for three years. What was it again? You oversaw an unemployment rate of 11 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Jagajaga interjects. We can always get a loud noise out of the member for Jagajaga. That is about all you are good for. When it comes down to substance you are deathly quiet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You spent $2.7 million in your last year in upgrading nursing homes, and then you bleat when we tried to do something about it. You are going to get up here with another scare campaign, run around and take responsibility off the individual that is supposed to hold that responsibility because you do not have any answers. That is the bottom line. As soon as you are challenged you go quiet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You said we are `abolishing payments for 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds'. That is not the case. The member for Werriwa stated that we were going to `force back into school' young people who could not get a job. Is this not a Labor Party that talks about trying to give job opportunities and education to young people? I put it to you: if you cannot find a job then perhaps there is something wrong with either your level of education or your training to enable you to fit into the job market. Therefore, forcing these young people back into school, as he puts it, would seem to me to be quite a reasonable proposal. We are saying to people, `If you do not have the skills that work force requires then let us do something about assisting you to get them. The safe 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> guards are there. If there are no positions available in the school or if there are no positions available in traineeships or any other form of education or training then there is financial support available to you.' But let us not let the facts get in the way of what I am sure will become another one of your scaremongering stories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is available and it is available in the electorate of Longman. The member for Werriwa quite wrongly points out that, because I was sitting in the chamber at the time listening to his diatribe, Longman was going to be one of those areas where there were not going to be sufficient opportunities. Through the activities of this federal government and the business community and the schools, we have put together one of the most innovative programs in this country: it is called the CASILS&mdash;Caboolture Area Schools Industry Link Scheme. I am hopeful that, in the next few days, ANTA will announce $400,000 for a unique program to mount six schools in a cluster to provide the students not only from those six schools&mdash;Deception Bay, St Columban's, Morayfield, Tullawong, Bribie Island and Caboolture&mdash;but also from other schools, maybe even interstate but certainly within Queensland, to access and immerse in technology which is going to take them into the next century. This is going to be available through funding that has been made available by this government to a community that wants to assist its young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This piece of legislation is about mutual obligation. In recent days we have heard the term `reciprocal responsibility' mouthed by those in opposition. When you marry that statement with this amendment you see that what they are trying to do is get the best of both worlds. Let us tell the people out there that we are telling young people&mdash;as we say on the front of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> this week&mdash;who want the dole and who want to make the best of it while the rest of us pay that, yes, we want to make them responsible. Let us tell Australia that the Labor Party has a bit of responsibility at last. But, at the same time, let us show that the flip card is, `No, we do not believe the individual can be responsible or that the family can be responsible.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10531">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa stated that there is a myriad of opportunities and different family situations. That is exactly what this piece of legislation suggests. We do not believe that a family that has a young person who is unemployed should be treated totally differently from one that is trying to put their young family member into an educational training situation. Obviously those opposite, and the member for Jagajaga in particular, believe that should be the case. They believe it is better to see someone sit unemployed without skills, without training and without education and give them financial support in order to do that rather than give them some extra resources to better themselves. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that is a fallacy and it is extreme foolishness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, they promoted the fact that we were getting a much greater level of education in Australia, that we had more students attending through to year 12. That was very commendable and the previous government should be congratulated for it. I have no problems with that. However, when you have the member for Werriwa saying that we are going to force young people back into school, you really have to question their credibility. You have to question whether or not they really believe this or whether it is rhetoric which they are starting to mouth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am quite sure, and it has been proven, that a young person's opportunities are enhanced if they spend an additional two years in education or training. I would like to explore that for a minute. This is not saying to young people, `The school system failed you. You didn't do very well and you weren't going on to university; you weren't going to be one of the 30 per cent. Get back into school. Get in there and listen and read your school books because that is what is best for you.' That is not what we are saying at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are opening up opportunities in vocational education, through such things that CASILS is operating in my electorate of Longman, where young people can spend one day a week in the work force and four days a week in school or can do a traineeship or any other form of training which could lead to work and which is going to better equip 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them to get into the work force. Those opposite are telling us that that is not right. They are telling us, `Let the person stay unemployed,' or, better still, `Put them onto one of our mickey mouse training courses that we had in place in our last years of government.' Some $2 billion was spent, and what did it attribute to the working part of Australia? Very little.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K6">Mr BROUGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Another point that the member for Werriwa made was that of the post-traditional age. That is a good term: `post-traditional age'. When did the tradition of families looking after their own disappear? I will tell you what: it has not disappeared in my house and I hope that it has not disappeared in most Australian homes. People, first and foremost, must be responsible for their own actions. If 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10532"> we move away from that basic fundamental, then we will become a socialist state. We know where the member for Jagajaga stands on that account: she has no qualms in talking about being a committed socialist. In that case, let the state provide. But that is certainly not the way that I believe things should be or that we on this side believe things should be. This social security system should be about providing for those people that the individual, the family and wider society are unable to assist. Then the government steps in, and this measure allows that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look a little more at students and what is available for them. One of the anomalies under the previous system was that you could have a family on relatively low incomes who, when you worked out the figures under Austudy, could get up to $999. But, because they did not break that magical figure of $1,000 which Labor had put in place, they did not get a cent. So $20 a week to a battling family which was trying to send a student to university was told that it did not get it, it was just too bad. That $20 might well have been the difference between that student going to university, moving out of the style of life that they may have been accustomed to and going further up the pecking order, which is what education is supposed to be about: providing opportunities not only for the individual but also for the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have now made that available. If you are able to access as little as $1 of what would have been Austudy under youth allowance and you are studying, you now have rental assistance available to you. For young people in regional Australia&mdash;and we are not talking about the back of Bourke; we are talking about people in my electorate at Esk who have to travel two hours to get to the closest university which is 100 kilometres away&mdash;being able to access rental assistance will enable them to better themselves and improve their lot in life. Surely that is what we as a government should be about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With those opposite, it was not as though they did not have rental allowance available for people. They did. But for whom was it available? Young unemployed people who we heard on several occasions had three, four, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> five and six people in one household&mdash;all sharing one accommodation bill and all receiving rental allowance. I do not despise them, I do not feel it is wrong that they should have some sort of financial assistance when it is needed if they are homeless, but how can you discriminate against young people who are trying to be educated? You are supposed to stand up for social righteousness. That is exactly what you did, and you continue to do so with your actions on this bill. It is time that you woke up to yourselves and realised that young people who are trying to better themselves deserve a better go than you were providing for them. This youth allowance bill will do just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the criticisms levelled by the opposition is that we are withdrawing support for 18&hyphen;to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in families with incomes as low as $23,400 per annum. If you were a young student and you were earning above $23,400, under the Labor Party what did you get? You know very well that what we have done here is bring into line both an unemployed person and a young student so that one is not discriminated over the other, so that no-one is better than the other, so that there is no class system because someone is studying and someone is unemployed. But that is what you wish to promote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You in the opposition call on the government to introduce education. Correct me if I am wrong&mdash;please feel free to do so&mdash;but I believe that every university place in Australia was oversubscribed this year. Am I correct? I am quite sure that I am. I note that you deliberately decide not to answer that every university place was actually oversubscribed. Where is the lack of education? Where is the lack of places?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa talks about the figure of 40 per cent, or whatever he quoted. The fact is that about 30 per cent of young Australians will go on to university. Yes, we think it is great that they do, but let's not forget the 70 per cent; let's provide them with both the financial ability and the facilities to participate in vocational education&mdash;education as in `proper' education&mdash;whether or not they have finished year 11 and year 12 or any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10533"> other form of formal training which will assist them into the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all acknowledge there are not enough jobs in Australia today. We also acknowledge that an educated population has got a far better chance of being productive as individuals and productive as a nation. So this bill promotes the fact that young people, given the opportunity and the financial resources, would be far better off spending their time in some form of training or education which could ultimately lead to work. As a former employer, I put it to you: if a young person came to me and did not have either the social skills, education, experience or training that I was looking for, it would not matter if they went and sat on the dole for another six months. It would not matter if they went and did some inadequate small course&mdash;to use a phrase which I was not going to use&mdash;which really was not going to lead to any benefit to them directly or to me as an employer. It would not matter how long they sat there, I would not employ them. But if that young person left and came back six months later or two years later, having had more life experience with an education system or with a training system, then there is every chance that I as an employer could see fit to put them on. I have increased their opportunity and I have paid them during that time to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation will align arrangements with those that currently apply to Austudy by paying youth allowance to parents of young people who are under 18 and not independent. If you are independent or if you have any myriad of situations in your life that the member for Werriwa referred to&mdash;you are homeless or the situation is that it is just not possible for you to be supported by your parents&mdash;then the system picks you up. That is exactly what it is designed to do. I am quite sure those opposite will try to portray this in some scaremongering fashion as some way of deriding those unfortunate people who have not got jobs. I believe it is an intergenerational change in people's attitudes so that they say, `I don't have the skills. I am not going to opt out. It is not in my interest to opt out. I am going to better myself and my parents will be supporting me in doing that be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cause there is no financial benefit in their seeing me unemployed and without the dole.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we have third generation unemployed. Not everyone out there is enlightened; not everyone out there believes that the best opportunity is to get the best level of training or the best level of education. So we as a government have a responsibility not to put disincentives in people's way&mdash;and that is exactly what this bill tries to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In answer to the criticism that the income threshold is too low, I am sure that I would like to see the income level higher as well, but where does the money come from? If we want to see it higher, do we continue down Labor's treacherous route of high deficits, treachery to the Australian population and treachery to our next generation, to whom we will continue to leave the legacy of our excesses?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that if we are going to be responsible, we have to ensure that every individual in Australia has a chance. The way you do that is to promote education, which this government has done. You have to promote vocational education and training opportunities as well if you are going to see those young people getting a better chance in life, a better chance than they had under Labor when we saw over one million unem

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can always tell when you are having a bit of an effect&mdash;it gets down to personal insult. I think we will just ignore that level of debate which the previous speaker, the member for Longman (Mr Brough), has contributed because it adds nothing to our understanding. It is interesting that he drew attention to the issue of nursing homes. A couple of weeks ago we might have said that Labor's criticisms were falling on deaf ears. Given that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself has admitted that he made a big mistake with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> his nursing home policy, maybe the member for Longman would like to catch up on the Prime Minister's views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The leader of the Labour government in Britain is doing an outstanding job. As the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) so accurately put it, he has trounced the Tory Party in that country and trounced it convincingly. He is looking very closely at the Australian Labor Party's policies when it was in government. One of the most important of those which contained the principle of reciprocal obligation was the policy that has now become known as Working Nation. It is true that Prime Minister Blair has looked very carefully at the policies set out in Working Nation and is introducing a variant of that. So let us get history straight and quote things accurately in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important thing that we need to do is create the best chance in life for our young people. There is no question about that. We need to do it through quality, education, training and work opportunities. It is a priority goal for governments and it should be a priority goal for this government. As many have said before&mdash;one would hope it would not become a cliche; it is such an important thing to say&mdash;our future does lie with our young people. The lack of a good education and unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, does put young Australians' and Australia's future at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment not only has a very devastating impact on the unemployed themselves and their families but it also represents a major loss to the wider community&mdash;the loss of ideas, enthusiasm, hope and energy as well as the loss of direct productive contributions. No measure that might assist young Australians should be dismissed without consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go through the details of this legislation that is here before us today. This debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997  does provide us with an opportunity to examine how the government's proposed youth allowance stacks up against the concerns that we all have about young people's education and about youth unemployment. Let us make it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10535"> very clear from the start that in Labor's view the proposed youth allowance may solve some problems but, unfortunately, it will be the case that other problems are also created for our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's approach will be where we can to solve the problems that the government's design of the youth allowance creates and we will be supporting some of the aspects of the allowance that the government has put before us. Overall, the common youth allowance is an example of a policy that will further disadvantage young adults from low income families in a labour market environment that is already working against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at 16- and 17-year-olds firstly. Young people do not finish school for a variety of reasons. They leave school early because of family or emotional difficulties, because their home life does not support their studying or because they have no home. They leave school early because of peer group pressure, because of alcohol and because of drugs. They leave school because they consider that the curriculum or the way they are taught or the school environment they find themselves in is just not relevant to their needs or aspirations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) will not have had the benefit of a study that has just been released by the national youth affairs research scheme, which I would recommend to all members of the House. It is a very useful publication called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Opting out</EMPHASIS>. It talks about underage school leaving, looking at approaches to assisting people at risk of leaving school before the legal school leaving age. As far as we are concerned, the results of the study are as relevant to those at risk of leaving before finishing year 12 as they are at risk of leaving before year 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This study actually investigates the factors which affect early school leaving, the barriers faced by early school leavers and the economic and social costs of early school leaving. It also identifies principles and issues which should be considered in any response to early school leaving and recommends a number of best practices which appear to be effective in reducing early school leaving. Needless to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say, in looking through the report, particularly looking at the recommendations in the report, forcing young people to stay at school by withdrawing any income support while they look for work does not figure. It does not appear among the list of recommended policy responses in this document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us make it quite clear: Labor does agree with the government that it is important for our young people to finish year 12. It is important because finishing year 12 does give young people the best chance in life and the best chance of taking up further education and getting into jobs that provide rewarding careers and decent wages. But from here of course we part company with the government. The income support payments of 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds are already tested on family income and assets, so we are talking about taking income support payments away from low income families&mdash;not middle income families, not wealthy families, but low income families. From 1 July next year they will receive no support unless they stay at or go back to school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has told us that some 12,000 16- and 17-year-olds&mdash;and only time will tell whether this figure is realistic&mdash;will be in this category. Schools, of course, as my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has pointed out, will receive no extra support to teach them&mdash;not one cent. Schools will not receive one cent from this government to help them deal with all the problems that young people leaving school before they finish year 12&mdash;for a whole lot of reasons that we understand a bit about&mdash;find themselves with. They will receive no extra support to teach them&mdash;not one cent. We know that the state and territory education authorities are already making contingency plans for this influx of young adults.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important point the member for Werriwa made was that these young people are concentrated in particular areas in Australia. They are concentrated in areas of extreme disadvantage. These young people are not evenly spread amongst the better off suburbs where the schools might be able to cope with an influx of one or two. That is not going to be the situation. Schools which are already 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10536"> dealing with families suffering from considerable disadvantage where both parents are unemployed will be told, `No, these young people have to come back to school, and you are not going to get one extra cent to help with their education.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know&mdash;maybe we do not all know; I think it is&mdash;this is a very serious matter. I certainly know what it is like to be in a place where young people do not want to be in a classroom. I can tell you, from very bitter personal experience, that forcing a young person to endure up to two years of doing something that they are neither willing nor suited for will not improve their prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless these young people have finished year 12, are studying for it, are in some other education or training or are homeless, these young people from low income families will get nothing. Taking the big stick to these young people, which is what this government is doing&mdash;and I do not know whether people opposite know these young people, but it is my experience&mdash;will have no positive impact whatsoever. Telling these young people that they will have their income support withdrawn will not get them to stay at school if they do not want to. We have to work with these young people and not threaten them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us state clearly, from Labor's prospective, that those at risk of leaving school early need our greatest, not our least, support. They are precisely the young people who stand to gain the most from undertaking the kinds of activities possible under the proposed youth allowance activity agreement which is actually contained in this legislation. They are precisely the young people who will benefit from intensive case management and career planning and from the educational and labour market assistance programs specifically designed to get young people into jobs. But are the 16- and 17-year-olds eligible for these youth activity agreements? No. As the Brotherhood of St Laurence stated in its recent evidence to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . forcing young people to stay at school in order to get an income . . . is a dubious, incomplete and probably counterproductive approach to the problems of youth unemployment and early school leaving.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are the very young people we should be trying to help, not the young people we turn our backs on or take the big stick to. For 18- to 20-year-olds, one of the very worst aspects of this bill is the imposition of a parental income, assets and actual means test on unemployed 18- to 20-year-olds. These are young Australians who are starting out in the labour force, who have made the shift from student to worker and who are independent or becoming independent of their parents. Social security arrangements are currently based on the premise that young people are independent at 18&mdash;when they can vote and when, if they come from a family where the parents have separated or divorced, there is no longer a legal obligation to provide child support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Imposing a parental income, assets and actual means test in effect means that 18- to 20-year-olds living in families with incomes as low as $23,400 a year will have their payments reduced. They are not wealthy families; they are poor families who are struggling to make ends meet and who are already facing higher costs because of this government's myriad of cuts to health, education, social security, higher costs of prescriptions, child care and aged care&mdash;and on it goes. These young people already know that their low income families are struggling to give them all the possible opportunities that life offers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the House do actually believe in reciprocal obligation. It is something that Labor worked hard on in the last few years and that led to Working Nation. We do not believe that the government's notion of `mutual obligation' has any `mutual' notion, because there is no side to this government that talks about `their side of the bargain'. It is all one side of the bargain. It is all about young people or their families giving up their payments. There is nothing in exchange from the government. There is no extra funding for education. In fact, as the member for Werriwa said, there are significant cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reciprocal obligation actually means obligations on both young, unemployed people to do what they can to find work or to do what they can to get back into education and on the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10537"> government to provide the job opportunities, the education, training and labour market assistance which allows our young people to embrace these opportunities. We do not think the government should abandon these young people and tell them that their families must support them. The government is saying to those families, `You're on your own. If you're unfortunate enough that your young adult is without work, then you look after them because the government is not going to help you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we said in our minority report on the youth allowance legislation, this component of the youth allowance that young unemployed people should be dependent on their parents until they turn 21, or until they turn 25 if they are in full-time education, is clearly at odds with the body of law and with community expectations. Young people become both civilly and criminally responsible from 18 years of age, if not earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But our concerns not only relate to the age related definition of `independence'. Other provisions of the bill allow a young person to be regarded as independent under a number of circumstances&mdash;previous work history, a spouse or a de facto partner of more than two years standing, a dependent child. Our concern is that, on the one hand, the criteria relating to previous work history are unlikely to be met, because not many 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds will be able to demonstrate that they have worked for at least 30 hours a week for at least 18 of the preceding 24 months or have earned 50 per cent of average weekly earnings. A young person who loses a job after 12 months will be forced to rely on their parents' support. Previously, this young person would have qualified as an independent person. On the other hand, marriage or the birth of a child would confer independent status and therefore higher rates of payment immediately. If the government is truly concerned about removing disincentives to study, this is not the way to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will in the brief time remaining indicate where Labor will be moving amendments to the bill to repair the damage caused by this legislation and where we see it threatening the lives of people, particularly young people and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their families. We will be moving amendments in the Senate to remove the requirement that a person aged under 18 be in full-time education or training or have completed the final year of post&hyphen;compulsory schooling before they are deemed to reach the minimum age for youth allowance. As I have said long and clear, we believe these young people need our greatest support. They are the ones that need intensive case management and career planning, alternative education, and labour market and job readiness programs&mdash;none of the things that this government is providing in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be moving amendments to ensure that unemployed 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds' eligibility for payments is not dependent on their parents' income, assets or actual means. We will also be moving amendments to restore the current arrangements for payments for young unemployed people with partners. We will be moving amendments which effectively restore the earnings credit scheme for young people who are not in full-time education. We will also be seeking to delete clause 553C, which talks about seasonal workers. This has been put in before we have seen the substantive legislation, and we do not believe this is the appropriate place in which this new notion should be debated in the first instance. In the 1997 budget the government announced new measures to deal with the income of seasonal workers under the social security income test. I will not go into the details now, except to say that we need to deal with that issue when this bill actually comes into the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the bill provides for all rates of youth allowance to be indexed annually&mdash;yet another way this government is reducing payments to our young people. Youth allowees stand to lose under these revised arrangements because at the moment payments are indexed every six months, not every year. Labor's amendments will protect young people's indexation entitlement. So let us on this side of the House remind everybody here that these young people, like other unemployed Australians, will get no protection from this government when it comes to helping people get back into education and no extra support when it comes to retraining or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10538"> extra job placement activities. All those things have gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole approach of this government is to take out the big stick to force our young people to go back to school: don't do anything positive to help them, just take away their income support&mdash;the one thing that enables them to get through and helps their families at a time of need. The government does nothing on the employment side, nothing to get them into a job. The government uses the one measure that it knows something about: the big stick. That is not the definition of mutual obligation or reciprocal obligation. That term needs two sides, one for the individual and the other for the government. This government knows about only a one&hyphen;sided approach. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise tonight in support of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill</XREF> . The Labor opposition, in typical fashion, tried to mount an outrageous scare campaign on the introduction of the youth allowance, quite wrongly claiming that many young 16- and 17-year-olds will be left without income support and totally disregarding the quite substantial increased benefits that will be flowing to most young people under this new youth allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already we have heard tonight from the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), who continued her scare campaign against this new youth allowance. I would like to remind the House and the Australian public of just some of the comments that she has made recently and some of the untruths that she is trying to spread in this campaign. Back on 18 June 1997, the member for Jagajaga said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Families with incomes as low as $25,000 will be facing a reduction in their budgets of $145 per fortnight&mdash;that is, $145 a fortnight&mdash;because their young 16&hyphen; or 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old cannot go to school, for whatever reason, and cannot find a job.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is totally untrue that they would be facing a reduction of $145 per fortnight. Then on 28 August the member for Jagajaga continued this scare campaign to the Australian public and to young people, whom the Labor Party basically disregarded and whose hopes it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> destroyed during its 13 years in government. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is going to be financed by taking all 16- and 17-year-olds who receive unemployment benefits off those benefits. These benefits are already means tested, so families with incomes as low as $5,000 a year are going to lose this already pretty meagre support for their 16- and 17-year-olds who cannot get a job.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the same day she went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . families will be forced back into poverty and young people, who will not all go back to school, no matter what you do to them, will be forced to earn their incomes in ways that nobody in this parliament would support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The correct figure is that those families on $25,000 per annum will still receive a youth allowance of at least $129.20. So you can see that the member for Jagajaga again is just trying to use the scare campaigns&mdash;don't let the facts get in the way; just keep spruiking the scare campaigns of what you like to peddle out there in the Australian community. The youth allowance is an income support payment which will be provided to some 560,000 young people, including students and those that are looking for work. It will replace five existing payments for young people, including Austudy for students under 25 years of age, the youth training 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10539"> allowance, the newstart allowance and the sickness allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth training allowance will simplify income support arrangements for young people, which of course is something the local community has been advocating for many years, by providing a more flexible and inclusive income support for young people. The Australian community will be better equipped to respond to future trends in education and the labour market. The youth allowance will send the right message to young people, a message that training and education are the key to obtaining a job and putting more meaning into their lives&mdash;unlike the messages of disillusionment and lack of hope that the Labor Party likes to send to young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far too many young people are dropping out of school in year 10 or year 11 aged 16 or 17 with no direction in life, very little formal training and very little chance of finding a job. Information provided by the Parliamentary Library's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> on this bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After a period of substantial and sustained growth in the proportions of young people completing school during the 1980s, recent years have seen a marked downturn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nationally, the proportion of young people remaining to Year 12 grew from approximately one-third at the beginning of the 1980s to a peak of 77 per cent in 1992. Since then it has fallen annually, dropping to a rate of 71 per cent in 1996. The trend has been experienced by both males and females, though slightly stronger amongst males.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A similar pattern of decline was recorded in the 1970s largely involving males. Underpinned by growth in apprenticeships and by narrowly focused senior school programs which failed to appeal to broader populations, teenagers (particularly males) placed more value on the labour market than on school as a source of economic security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further incentive to leave school was the provision of unemployment benefits for 16-17 year olds which provided short-term financial incentives to leave full-time education.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The previous Labor government for 13 years fostered that welfare mentality, and it is obvious that the member for Jagajaga wishes to continue to foster that welfare mentality&mdash;fostered in our young people the belief that the government and the Australian taxpayer 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> owed them and that they automatically would expect to get unemployment benefits the minute they decided they did not want to go to school anymore. This welfare mentality is destructive and negative. It takes away incentives from young people. It takes away their drive and their determination to get out there, have a go and succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the previous government it was far too easy for young people to opt out of school, to drop out and get the dole. They even had incentives for young people to leave home, because they could get more money if they claimed they were homeless, when in fact many of those young people had decent homes to go to. Under the previous government, during the 1980s we had the recession we `had to have', according to Paul Keating, which destroyed thousands of jobs and destroyed the hope and optimism of hundreds of thousands of young Australians. It was during this time, when unemployment rose to almost 12 per cent and youth unemployment reached 34 per cent, that this welfare mentality was fostered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, with a Labor government languishing with no ability to manage the economy and with no way of understanding the unemployment problem, many young people felt they did not have a hope of getting a job then or in the future, and their optimism quickly waned. They felt there was no point in continuing in education or training because there was no possible hope of them getting a job at the end of it. But of course they knew that they could just drop out of school, or work or do training and just pick up the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance will encourage students to stay at school, encourage students to seek further vocational education and training and give them every chance of securing a future in this fast moving and competitive world. Of the 560,000 who currently receive income support, 416,000 are students aged between 16 and 25 and 144,000 are unemployed aged between 16 and 21. Of these 560,000 people, 378,000 will receive the same amount of money as they currently do. But, more importantly, 137,000 young people will receive more money than they currently do.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10540">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new youth allowance will not abolish the dole for the 16- and 17-year-olds, contrary to many claims that have been made in the scare campaign organised by the Labor opposition and spearheaded by the member for Jagajaga. Young people who finish year 12 are much more likely to get a job. That is why the youth allowance will usually be paid only to under&hyphen;18s who are studying or who are in training. Of course, families will be financially better off as well, because parents will still be able to claim the family tax initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation does recognise, however, that study or training is not always possible for all under&hyphen;18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. People who are sick, who are homeless, who cannot find an appropriate place of study or training program or who are temporarily unemployed but have had a job will still be able to qualify for the youth allowance. Also, the youth allowance will not treat 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds unfairly. Students aged 16 to 24, and unemployed people who are under 18, are already subject to a parental means testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance simply ensures that all young people are treated equally&mdash;sensible independence criteria. For example, for those who work full time for 12 months or more or who are living away from home, those who are married or have been in a de facto relationship for at least two years or those who have a dependent child or who are homeless or who were on a payment at the time of the announcement, which was 17 June 1997, it will mean that people who are clearly no longer dependent on their families will not be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance will not penalise low income families. Eighteen&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds from low income families, including those whose parents are on a pension or an allowance, will continue to be eligible for the maximum rate of payments. I repeat: they will continue to be eligible for the maximum rate of payments. They will benefit from the abolition of the 13 week school leaver waiting period, which means they will not have to wait 13 weeks to get a benefit after they leave school&mdash;again, another significant improvement. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a tangible improvement of streamlining the system and creating a simplified income support arrangement. It shows that students will not have to swap and change from an Austudy payment and then wait 13 weeks&mdash;a very long time for families on low incomes, sometimes causing quite difficult financial situations for those students and families&mdash;before becoming eligible for unemployment benefits if they have not been able to find a job. With the youth allowance, under these new simplified income support arrangements, there will be none of this chopping and changing, and it will give certainty and security to those young people who do need income support from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes will be welcomed by all those who are currently receiving Austudy. I have received representations on many occasions from young people who were on Austudy, claiming that the current system disadvantaged those who were making an effort to better themselves by continuing in training and education in an effort to receive higher qualifications and make themselves certainly more employable in an attempt to carve out a future for themselves as compared with those who simply went on unemployment benefits. Those on unemployment benefits did not have the additional expenses that many people do whilst travelling to and from school or university on a daily basis, plus the other additional education expenses associated with that study such as textbooks, writing equipment and other necessary educational items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Full-time students, currently the Austudy recipients, who will be approximately 70 per cent of the total youth allowance population, will gain. Around 70,000 students who have to live away from home will qualify for the first time for rent assistance, 17,000 will benefit from a more lenient, independent assessment criteria than now currently applied under the Austudy regulations and 41,000 will gain from the abolition of the minimum entitlement requirement of $1,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, at present those people who may be eligible for almost $20 a week in benefits just because they are just under that limit of $1,000 receive absolutely 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10541"> nothing. That $20 a week certainly will be well appreciated by many families whose young people are currently studying. Under those current Austudy provisions, no allowance is paid&mdash;not one cent&mdash;if the annual entitlement amount is below that $1,000. This, of course, will be abolished under the youth allowance. As I have said, it will be a benefit to around 41,000 students; they will benefit by up to $38 per fortnight. That certainly is a very significant increase for those 41,000 students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people aged under 18 living away from home will receive a higher rate of payment, and rent assistance will be available. This will include young people who are exempt from the requirements to be in full-time study or training. The away from home rate will be available for young people who live away from their parents' home&mdash;that is, young people who are dependent on their parents but who need to live away from home to pursue their educational training or to look for work will also be eligible for that away from home rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor opposition quite wrongly claim that the youth allowance will encourage young people to leave home. Nothing could be further from the truth. Young people who are not independent and who do not need to live away from home for an improved employment or study reason will be eligible only for the living at home rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All students will now have access to the $500 loan advance, currently available under newstart. These changes are based on the premise of mutual obligation&mdash;something which this government initiated and promoted through the Australian community prior to the last election and something that has been welcomed by the Australian community. It sends a very clear message to our young people that all under 18 year olds who do not have year 12 or equivalent will be required to be in full&hyphen;time education or training unless they are specifically exempted from this requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is determined to ensure that all young people make the very best of their education and are given every opportunity to carve out a future for themselves in this very competitive world. Education and train 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing are the key to finding a successful career, and the changes to the common youth allowance will encourage young people to remain at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, imagine two different scenarios. One is in the present situation. You have a young 16 year old boy or girl who comes home to their mum or dad and says, `I'm pretty bored at school. I really don't like school and can't see a future for myself there. I just want to leave,' knowing full well that the minute they walk out of school they can walk straight down to the closest Centrelink office and pick up their unemployment benefits. Many parents, when faced with that situation, would say, `Well, if that's what you want to do, okay, I may not be happy with it, but you can go and get the dole and drop out of school.' Their future, of course, will be very grim without that education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that will change under this legislation. As you can imagine, now the scenario will be slightly different if the young 16&hyphen; or 17&hyphen;yearold comes home from school and tells their parents the same thing, that they are not happy with school and want to drop out. The parents will ensure that that young person either finds alternative and effective training or in fact finds a job to support themselves before leaving school. Otherwise, the responsibility for supporting those young people, as it rightfully should, will fall back to the parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make no excuses for supporting that type of parental responsibility. In our society today there are some parents who are far too quick to step away from their responsibilities as parents. We who have brought children into this world are responsible for those children until they become adults. Many of us here, including me, know that, even when we do become adults, as parents our responsibilities seem to continue to guide our children the best way we can throughout their lives, no matter how old they are.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It most certainly is. A very fair personal income test will be applied based on those issues and the current social security allowance system. For full-time students, income between $230 and $310 per fortnight 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10542"> reduces fortnightly allowances by 50c in the dollar. An income above $310 per fortnight reduces the income support by 70c in the dollar. For other young people, fortnightly income between $60 and $140 reduces the fortnightly allowances by 50c in the dollar. An income above $140 per fortnight reduces the fortnightly allowance by 70c in the dollar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very importantly, full-time students will be able to use an income bank to accumulate any unused fortnightly income free areas up to a limit of $6,000. The income bank is available only to full-time students and those in full-time training for the period of their course. It is designed to accommodate the fact that students generally earn income over the vacation period rather than throughout the year. So students can accumulate any unused part of their fortnightly income free area of $230 per fortnight up to that maximum of $6,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example of this would be a student who worked in a casual job waitressing throughout the year and who on average earned around $140 per fortnight. She or he could then accumulate the balance of their fortnightly income free area, which is $90, into an income bank so that when they started working full-time during the school holidays&mdash;say, over the Christmas holidays&mdash;their income bank was $2,160. They could earn this much before their fortnightly payments of youth allowance began to reduce&mdash;a very fair and sensible measure. Without this facility of an income bank, as soon as they started to work full time over the holidays that person's income would reduce the fortnightly youth allowance payments, which would not be fair. Special provisions will apply to 18 to 20 year olds who are already on the newstart or sickness allowances. They will still be able to claim the fair allowances in line with the current Austudy provisions and other existing allowances. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure whether this is the third or fourth or fifth or sixth leg in this government's assault on Australian families. For a group of people who stood on a platform of being pro family and who still parade under that title, it is very difficult to imagine 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a policy which is more anti-family. I seem to recall last year government members speaking about nursing homes in similar terms for their then budget measure. Let me advise government members that what has happened with nursing homes is going to happen here but only worse, because the anger and difficulty the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill</XREF>  will cause will be to a much more energetic group of people who have a much longer future than those disempowered people who require nursing home places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the nastiest tricks, one of the nastiest little innovations, imaginable from a government that is supposedly pro family. Mind you, we should not forget that this is the same party that sent 18 year olds off to war to get killed. They could not vote but they could go and get shot in Vietnam. This is the same party that is now saying that these young people are still the responsibility of their parents until they are 21. This party sent this group of young Australians to war 30 years ago, deciding by a draw from a barrel as to who went. Every year we go through the Vietnam services for young men, 18, 19, 20 and 21 years old, who were killed and maimed in war. We are still seeing the trauma of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the same `pro&hyphen;family' party that is now saying to the 30,000 young people who are under 18: `Forget any income support altogether.' The idea of full-time education and training is a joke because the government has cut funding to schools and to TAFE. In other words, the bodies that could provide full-time training and education do not have the places. The government admits that. The state governments have made it clear that there would be a shortfall of some $127 million in the education budget if all of those young people stayed at school up to year 12, and that is apart from the cuts they have already suffered. The `pro-family' parties opposite say: `Remove income support for people under 18 unless they are in full-time training.' We say: `Okay, where are the places?' They say: `That is not our business. It is not our problem.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10543">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea is that these young people will stay at school, like it or not, because it is the only way the family can survive. And remember the figure&mdash;$23,400 per year is where it starts to cut off for people who are in training or education. This is not new apprenticeships, this is not working for the dole&mdash;this is none of those things. Sixteen&hyphen; to 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who are not at school or in full-time education or training get absolutely nothing. Those families are going to carry the cost of not just feeding and clothing those young Australians but also helping them with the funds needed to find work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter about the income at all. It does not matter whether it is $23,000 or $15,000; they still have to find the money to feed them. What they have just done is dramatically reduce the income of some of the worst off families in the country. Some of the families that are the most financially stressed in the country are going to have their incomes cut because those opposite have somehow decided that if you are under 18 you must be in full&hyphen;time training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea of this whole scheme is not about youth or families; it is about money. This is another exercise from that budget in 1996. It is the same kind of mentality. This is a family program designed by Treasury and Finance. We have already seen nursing homes designed by Treasury and Finance. We are now seeing family policy designed by Treasury and Finance. We are about to see in February a whammy&mdash;therapeutic drugs policy designed by Treasury and Finance. They use these glib words that on the surface appear okay. Do you know why that is the case? It is because Treasury and Finance do not know how the programs work. They do not really understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you what will happen&mdash;and when it starts happening in your electorate don't come in here complaining. When young people start to realise that the only way to get money is to not live at home, then all the things you have said for the last four or five years about homeless allowance being an attraction for young people to leave home will start to happen. It is already happening now because of Austudy, quite frankly. The chan 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ges to Austudy brought in at the start of this year have seen in my electorate families break down. And you all know this. This is not news to anybody in this parliament. We all get the same cases coming across our desks week in and week out, so we all know. Those opposite who start to pretend that this is a progressive social measure know they are being dishonest, not just with this parliament but with their constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without doubt we will see an increase in the rate of homelessness because those families on very low incomes whose children are 16 or 17 and not in full&hyphen;time training for a number of reasons&mdash;it may be because they have a learning disability and the programs are no longer there or because there are no facilities where they live&mdash;will not get funds to go somewhere else. All those programs have been cut. What happened to SAR, the students at risk program? It got cut. All the things that were there to try to help these families have been cut back. Then along comes the whammy of them all&mdash;the ripping out of the whole income support for 30,000 of them under 18.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go further, to the 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. This is the Vietnam cohort&mdash;the conscripts. It is a new kind of conscription: send them to war in one generation; in the next generation rip away any shred of independence. I can remember very clearly when this stuff was first announced. It was going to be grandfathered. In other words, people who were getting the benefits at the time would not lose them. It is hard to find where that is mentioned in here. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) in his tabling speech carefully does not mention that at all. The department seems to say, `We are still working out the regulations.' But the fact is we are going to have young people of 19 and 20 who are going to be solely dependent on their parents' income, and at $23,000 a year it starts to cut out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the government has already ripped Austudy out from 125,000 young people by increasing the age of independence to 25. This is going back to the dark ages again. Mr Deputy Speaker, you were not here in 1983 when the age of independence for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10544"> Austudy was 25. What we have seen in the last year and a half is regression, but with a twist to it. When a person got to 25 they were entitled to Austudy. The twist is that if you start a course when you are 25 you miss out. A person starting medicine at 24 will still be dependent on parental income until they are 29, 30 or 31, depending on how well they progress. So they have actually made it worse than it was pre&hyphen;1983. You have ripped away 125,000 Austudy places already and now you are going to the next level of 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;yearolds and means testing them fully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The speakers opposite are all indulging in deception of this parliament because the impression they are giving&mdash;very deliberately&mdash;is that the current jobsearch allowance for 16&hyphen; to 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds is means tested. Only half of it is means tested. Part of it is not means tested at all. Everyone who is looking for a job is entitled to a base amount which is not means tested. They have a lot of hoops to jump through&mdash;the work test, the availability test&mdash;to qualify for that, but they all get a base amount. It is means tested beyond that. The impression the government is giving to people is that it is all means tested. That is deceitful and dishonest. But then what else would you expect from a government that is perpetrating one of the nastiest frauds on Australian families that we have ever seen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To fully means test the 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and make out that this is somehow making it the same as it is for 16&hyphen; to 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds will put pressure like we have never seen on those young people and their families. Most of us in this place are parents. The responsibility of parents is to teach their children to become independent. The period from 16 to 21 is critical in that transition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge those members of the government who are new to this place, and even those who are not new but have not read it, to go and read a report that was prepared in the last parliament by the Standing Committee on Community Affairs on aspects of youth homelessness&mdash;a report which the minister who wrote this tabling speech was involved in. If you are really interested, go and read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the committee hearings and read of the tragedies that were occurring out 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there&mdash;the 30,000 young Australians who were being abused every year, the number of children from dysfunctional families, the number of young people who are not able to develop the self&hyphen;esteem and all the things that are needed to cope in this world&mdash;and look at what we put forward in terms of additional support that was needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are you doing? You have done the opposite: you have ripped away what was there. This is the final straw; this is the final nasty bit. What you are finally doing now is saying, `Lock them into the house until they are 21.' That is what you are saying. For so many households there will be no other money available. They will not be able to afford to go to another town and rent while they seek work. How could they do that? How could a person from a small country town go to a bigger town and look for work? Who is going to pay for that? The government is not going to and there is no other income available for them to have some sort of independence. The whole functionality of developing and establishing independence for young people so that they too can become parents with some esteem and some pride is interfered with by locking them into their houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a lock them up and throw away the key exercise. It is based on the false notion that somehow by giving them income support you encourage them to leave home. This is an absolutely nonsensical notion. The party that sent young people to Vietnam to get killed now wants to lock them into their houses. I find that a fascinating concept. Thirty years ago you could send them off to war. Back in the 1960s the vote was not available to people that age. Now, 30 years later, when they have got the vote, what are you doing to them? You are tying them to their parents' income, where support starts to cut out at $23,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliament has a lot of responsibilities in this country. We can and do affect how people live, how they cope and how they develop. We do influence the growth of our society or its regression. In this last year and a half we have seen a series of measures which have been driven by budget savings for a fictitious objective, with incredibly serious 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10545"> consequences. We have watched with some interest in recent months while government members have been writhing around because last year they were pretending the nursing home initiative was terrific. Go read their speeches: one after another they went on and on about what wonders it would achieve. We all knew that was nonsense. They were either ignorant or deceitful. In the months ahead we will be watching developments with the therapeutic grouping arrangement, these new kinds of drug groups. We will be watching how those who have been proclaiming that it is a wonderful scheme get off that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July next year we will start to watch with interest how all the people opposite speaking in this debate start to square off with their electorates and their families as to why it is that there is no help, as to why it is that a 19 year old in a household on $30,000 is being fully supported when in fact that 19 year old is doing their level best to try to get a job, despite the fact that the high cost of travelling to look for work on the Central Coast and the cost of living somewhere else to try and find a job is beyond their capacity. So they are locked into a house in a place where there are no jobs available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tensions on those families will become impossible. And, when those tensions erupt, don't forget it. Don't come in here and talk about youth suicide, don't come in here and talk about families, because what you are doing now will be the worst thing that has ever happened in my time in this parliament to exacerbate the stress and tensions on young Australians and their families. These people simply need assistance and support so that they can continue their maturation. What is happening now is that that is being denied to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite try to dress this up in some sort of absolutely obscure guise of being good policy. The minister has not tried to do that, to be honest. He has not had the gall to actually go quite as far as to say that it is actually good social policy. He has used a lot of other words about it but has said very little about what it would actually do to benefit the personal development of these people. What came out in the Senate inquiry is what will be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coming out in the months ahead. We are now in November. It comes in in July next year, and we are going to have six or seven months of case after case of young people and their parents coming into our offices explaining to us how it is going to affect them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members opposite see that human tragedy, as you see that stress, as you see that unfolding, have the guts to come in and tell us. Tell them too that the funding for TAFE has been cut and the funding to schools has been cut. Have the guts to come in and tell them you were wrong. The fact is that this is not just a mistake; this is a conscious, deliberate blunder. It is not just one party here. On one hand it is being done by Treasury and Finance, but there is a strong school of thought within the government which is of a puritan nature, which is of the view that the best way to make young kids grow up is to lock them up in their houses and make them totally dependent on the parents. Keep them under control; this is about control. The tragedy is that the parents involved do not want to control their kids. They understand that their kids need to grow up. This is about giving parents control when parents do not want it. So what we are getting is a throwback not just to the 1950s but I think to way before that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am from a family where both parents left school at the age of 12 and had to go out and work at that very young age. I chaired that inquiry into homelessness and I watched the tragedy that has been unfolding for years, and we know it. I am watching what is happening here and I say, `Go and do some homework. Go and talk to those kids, go and talk to their families.' I do not know which planet you people are on, but on this one we certainly should not be cutting away income support from low income families for under 18 year olds and cutting away income for young Australians 18, 19 and 20 and making them dependent on their families when so many have had that income cut. The question of control will become the major issue between young people and their parents when the passage to independence, which is such a vital part of development in our society, is being 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10546"> driven by a government policy about money and nothing else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The party that sent kids off to get killed at this age is the same party that now wants to lock them into their houses, and I find that barbaric. They were barbaric then and they are still barbaric.</PARA>

The honourable member for Newcastle was one of those who suggested that this policy was being driven by a desire to cut costs. The reality is that this is not a savings measure. The program costs, not including running costs, will mean an additional spending of $25 million in the first year. Clearly, we are prepared to spend this money as an investment in the future of our young Australians. We all ought to always understand that young people are our nation's future, and this government has had the intestinal fortitude to bring forward a policy which will improve outcomes for young Australians.</PARA>

We have delivered the lowest home loan interest rates in 30 years, and that is a saving in interest of $330 a month for the average home buyer.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also delivered a tax cut of up to $450 for private health insurance, as promised. We have delivered a tax cut on savings of up to $450 per taxpayer per year. We have delivered a safer community by reducing the number of firearms, along with banning semi&hyphen;automatic firearms. I must say that the opposition did support us on that one. We have delivered more apprenticeships to create more jobs for our kids. We have delivered a crackdown on welfare cheats that Labor was too weak to do. We have saved over $1 billion in taxpayers' money. We have delivered fairer new workplace relations laws that allow Australians to find a better balance between work and family commitments. I know the parliamentary secretary at the table has supported the minister in implementing this legislation. We have delivered the largest environmental package in Australia's history to make Australia a better place for all Australians. We have delivered a plan for better literacy skills for our kids. And we have delivered a government for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge the honourable member for Newcastle to go back and look at what this government has done. I would urge him to maybe come back and apologise for his accusation that we are an anti&hyphen;family government. What absolute nonsense. The simple fact of the matter is that we have the runs on the board, and we do not apologise for this youth allowance package, which we believe is a very positive package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the youth allowance, unemployed young people aged 18 to 20 will be subject to a parental means test and treated in the same way as full&hyphen;time students. This arrangement will require families to support their children until they have achieved financial independence, where they can afford to do so. I see that as being eminently supportable. Having children is a lifetime vocation. I find both abhorrent and repugnant the notion we have heard from those opposite that somehow, when young people attain the age of 18 years, parents no longer have responsibility for them. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10549">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another element of the youth allowance will mean that payments to young people under 18 years of age who have to live away from home will be increased and that rent assistance will be extended to students, both measures benefiting particularly those from rural areas. The education legal waiting period will be abolished, ensuring that young people in lower income families are not left without income support for up to three months after they leave school. The independence criteria which allow the parental means test to be waived will be more realistic, and special safety net criteria will ensure that young people aged over 18 with work force experience will not be disadvantaged. The Austudy minimum payment of $1,000 per annum will be abolished, and the flexible activity test requirements will encourage young people to remain in education while enabling support for those for whom full&hyphen;time schooling is not an appropriate option. The honourable member for Newcastle suggested that we were, in effect, throwing young people out of education and we were not making provision for those for whom education was not a viable option. That is simply an enormous departure from the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, there will be costs in the first year of $25 million. This is a very generous action by the government. Some 122,000 students will benefit from the alignment of rates and access to rent assistance. I think that is a very positive action and I believe it is strongly supported by the Australian people. Some people have suggested, particularly the honourable member for Newcastle, that parental means testing is in some way inappropriate. The legislation will ensure that the impact of parental means testing on 18- to 20-year-old unemployed young people will be reduced in a number of ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be reduced by the special safety net criteria, under which those disadvantaged in education or the labour market will be granted youth allowance free of parental means testing if they have worked full time for 12 months or more and are aged at least 18 years and living away from home. It will be reduced by the fact that young people can qualify as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> independent if they are married or have been in a de facto relationship for at least two years or have a dependent child or are homeless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be reduced by preserving the entitlements of those on payment at the time of announcement of youth announcement until they turn 21 years of age, and by the abolition of the education leavers' waiting period to ensure continuity of income support between completing school and starting work. It will also be reduced by the continuation of maximum rates of payment to children from low income families, including those whose parents are pensioners or beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these facts contained in this package point out that the honourable member for Newcastle and other Labor speakers are involved in an absolutely shameful and indefensible scare campaign reminiscent of the appalling use of politics which we saw recently over nursing homes. This is a very positive initiative by the government. This is good policy. It is a good social policy reform. It is fair, equitable, decent, right and proper, and it is backed strongly by the Australian electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By opposing our youth allowance package, the Labor Party once again is showing how irrelevant it is to Australian politics. We all remember that Labor was reduced to 49 seats at the last election. We all know that the Liberal Party has  76 seats and that the National Party has 18 seats. Together, as a government, we are strongly governing this nation with 94 members of parliament. Instead of saying that they got it wrong at the last election, instead of saying that people rightly rejected them, they limp into the parliament bill after bill after bill announcing their opposition to our attempts to repair the situation that we inherited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were in office for 13 years and they did absolutely nothing to benefit this country in any major way. Yet they are proving themselves to be the great knockers of Australian politics. Instead of engaging with us in a constructive policy debate, they are coming out and opposing every initiative which we are seeking to implement. I think the Australian people are sick and tired of politicians 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10550"> who merely play negative politics. I think they would prefer the Labor Party to say that they have looked at this particular legislation and they either support it or reject it for these reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Labor Party is taking the view that, because the government has announced the youth allowance, because it is government policy, because the Labor Party is close to controlling the Senate in certain circumstances, it can get away with this shameful departure into playing party  politics. The future of our young people is far too important for the Labor Party to seek to destroy by being involved in a deceitful and despicable scare campaign over the youth allowance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I am sure you will extend the same great latitude to me that your colleague the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) enjoyed in his contribution. Firstly, I have to apologise for disappointing the member for Fisher. I am under no great party threat; it is my own decision not to support him and the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997</XREF> . I would like to explain why. In doing so, I will refer to a couple of bipartisan examples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A parliamentary committee that I was pleased to chair brought down a report in March 1991 on student financial assistance. One of the key recommendations of that report was that we ought to lower the age of independence for Austudy from 25 years to 21 years and that it ought to be done progressively. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be pleased to know that your colleagues John Anderson and Bruce Scott supported that recommendation, as did all members of the then opposition, to their great credit, and I acknowledge their contribution. It is a pity that the member for Fisher did not elaborate in his contribution as to why now, some six years later, we have this great backflip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went through the report again before I was due to speak, just to check the recommendations&mdash;I thought it was one of the recommendations. I do recall that the then opposition, now government, members were making the point that they were very concerned about students who went on to senior years of education, that is, years 11 and 12, with the sole purpose of collecting Austudy. They felt that there ought to be some hurdles involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst we did not make a recommendation around that, I do wish to acknowledge that that view was not dismissed and was respected by the committee as a whole. What do we see now? There has been a detailed study in five high schools in my electorate. I can report to the House that in New South Wales the average retention rate in years 10, 11 and 12 is 66 per cent. The best of those five schools has a retention rate of 50 per cent and, if my memory serves me correctly, one of them dips down to about 35 per cent. I am trying to say that there is a majority amongst those five high schools of students who are actually leaving. When this youth allowance came in and was designed to take away from the numbers of people who were unemployed, that is, ages 16 and 17 not in schooling, I calculated&mdash;and I regret correcting the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham)&mdash;that it was not some 200&hyphen;odd students that would be affected in my electorate but some 320. Again, I say to the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), who is so enthusiastic about this package, that even the department 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10551"> recognised that if you are going to have 320 students in my electorate forced back into school, as this legislation is clearly designed to achieve, then schools will need extra resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a little disruptive to have so many students going back into 12 high schools in my electorate with probably the single purpose of collecting that allowance. It is not good for them and I think it is even worse for the students that are actually there. Do not take my figure, Mr Deputy Speaker, the department calculates that there will be 27,000 students so affected and schools need $140 million to cater for this extra increase. There is not one dollar extra allocated in this bill to cater for this&mdash;not one dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said I would refer to two reports. I must say the first report I was associated with was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Restless Years</EMPHASIS>, an inquiry into year 11 and 12 retention rates. It is very clear from this report that student needs are changing over time. I think it is the first report of the parliament to actually recommend senior high schools with feeder junior high schools, which I think in electorates like mine have a great utility. Indeed, probably New South Wales is the most under&hyphen;represented state as far as public senior high schools are concerned, and I would like to see that changing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one thing guaranteed about education and that is that you may feel that there are very sharp divisions between high schools, TAFEs and universities, but over time they are going to blur quite significantly. We really need flexible structures. In my own electorate I have championed for the past 10 years, together with my state parliamentary colleagues, the cause of having a senior high school in Mount Druitt. We are very close to getting it. Again, the campaign 10 years ago resulted in St Mary's Senior High School, the very first public senior high school in New South Wales, but without feeder junior highs from years 7 to 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this senior high school, I am strongly advocating a few propositions. There should not be merely vocational subjects that may have TAFE accreditation, that is, vocational subjects designed by the department of education. I believe that we have a unique oppor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tunity to place TAFE courses in the high schools. We also have the opportunity to have flexible hours for the school. Why should senior students, in years 11 and 12, operate merely from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock? The experience generally speaking is that many students to survive in years 11 and 12 take part&hyphen;time jobs. I do not think this is a bad thing; I think it is a very good thing. But whether you think it is a bad thing or a good thing, students are doing it and we ought to take note of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue that I would like to take up is the real need to give students second chances at education, but not by compulsion. The real problem is that we have to make schools attractive. It is not a problem with independent schools. They have a retention rate of 100 per cent. I think Cammeray is burdened with one student in that suburb going back under this legislation where there are 320 in my electorate.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not have to worry about independent schools. I am talking about the poorer independent schools and certainly public schools. We need to make them attractive to students, and we need to make relevant what is being offered to students. For those that slip under the wire, we need to give them second chance opportunities. Indeed, we need to encourage  adults back into schools. This already occurs, but they ought to be encouraged in greater numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing in this legislation that is going to facilitate that. It is all about compulsion; it is all about telling these things to students who, for whatever reason, have left school. The students that leave in years 11 and 12 are not the students that I have the greatest concern for, although we should be concerned for them. The students that I have the greatest concern for are those that leave in grade 6, year 7, year 8 or year 9. They are the ones who are dropping out of the system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the adjournment debate tonight I would like to comment on the growing campaign that is now happening in western Sydney against the construction of the international airport at Badgerys Creek. This is a campaign which represents the true aspirations and concerns of a great majority of the 1.4 million people living in western Sydney. This is a campaign which has at its roots ordinary people&mdash;people not concerned about politics or about winning elections but people concerned about their health, their lifestyles and the safety and future of their children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a campaign which we have only just begun to fight. It is a campaign which has barely begun to pick up steam. If the federal government thought the political stink kicked up by the community groups in Sydney's inner city over the third runway was big&mdash;if they thought that campaign created a political headache&mdash;wait until they see what will happen if they persist in ramming this international airport down our throats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a campaign which is no longer simply limited to the suburbs of western Sydney. Just a few short weeks ago we saw a welcome escalation in the fight against Badgerys Creek when the city councils which make up the anti-airport Western Sydney Alliance led the NSW Local Government Association Conference in a resolution which saw it remove from its policy statement on transport any support for Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously, the official policy of the NSW Local Government Association was that `local government support the construction of Badgerys Creek airport to international standard.' Such a policy no longer exists. The question of supporting an airport at Badgerys Creek has now been referred to the LGA's executive, which will discuss the matter again once the EIS has been handed down.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this is a major victory&mdash;a major first step in the grassroots campaign against Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud of the way in which all the councils in Sydney's west, bar Liverpool City Council, are now working together on this issue. Through their solidarity and their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shared concern&mdash;a concern which is, as I have said, above party politics&mdash;they have managed to convince other councils throughout NSW that Badgerys Creek is not the way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since I am talking about Sydney's west, it is a continuing cause of concern for me that while the councils, which are members of the Western Sydney Alliance, are actively representing the concerns of their constituents in relation to Badgerys Creek and while members such as myself and the members for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) and Chifley (Mr Price) are regularly standing up in this House and expressing our constituent's objections to Badgerys Creek, we still have an almost deathly quiet on the subject when it comes to the Liberal Party members for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), Macquarie (Mr Bartlett), Macarthur (Mr Fahey) and Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The councils in each of these member's electorates&mdash;Penrith, Parramatta, Blue Mountains, Camden and Wollondilly&mdash;have all joined the fight against Badgerys Creek. Each of these councils know and understand the feelings of the people they represent and are speaking out accordingly. The question must then be asked, `If this is the case, why aren't we hearing anything on this subject from the federal members who represent these areas?' In not speaking up about what is worrying their constituents in relation to Badgerys Creek, these four members are not fulfilling their duties as representatives of this parliament. They are, for all intents and purposes, ignoring their constituents. Why? Is it because they do not care one way or another? Is it because they just have not got around to talking about it yet or is it because they support Badgerys Creek? Their constituents want to know; in fact, we would all like to know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lindsay was saying in one of her local papers the other week how she was going to mail out a survey to each of her constituents in order to gauge their opinions on Badgerys Creek. The member for Lindsay should save her postal allowance. She should send her constituents a Christmas card instead. For the price of a local telephone call I or any one of her constituents could quite 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10553"> easily tell her that the people of Penrith&mdash;the people of western Sydney&mdash;do not want an airport at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the member for Lindsay, along with her western Sydney colleagues, has not seen the contour maps for Badgerys Creek options A, B or C and how they will send screaming jumbo jets over the heart of her electorate 24 hours a day. Perhaps, as relatively new members, they are still learning the ropes and just have not been able to organise themselves into finding the time to come into this House and let their constituents know their opinions on Badgerys Creek. Or perhaps it is the other alternative I mentioned earlier. By their silence on this matter, are they giving their implicit support for a 24&hyphen;hour international airport at Badgerys Creek?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the next stage of this campaign should be getting these members to state clearly and unambiguously their positions on Badgerys Creek&mdash;to nail their colours to the mast. Their constituents do not want to hear excuses. They do not want to hear them making justifications. They want a simple answer to the question: do you support an international airport at Badgerys Creek, yes or no?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The longer these four members fail to come clean on this very straightforward question, the sooner their constituents will come to the only conclusion left open to them&mdash;that is, their federal representatives want to build a 24-hour international airport at Badgerys Creek. Let these members tell their constituents at Parramatta, Penrith, Wollondilly, Camden and the Blue Mountains what they truly think of this particular proposal. I believer that time is of the essence. We must come out united on this so that our constituents know that we are fighting the fight for them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10553"><TITLE>Cricket: Possible Strike</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the pace has quickened to an ever rapid downward spiral. Where once the only sound on a cricket field was an appeal or bat on ball or bat on pad, snick, and generally a genuine one, or a complimentary nod or word of approval or some byplay, we have now become accustomed to seeing cricket become an arena for the nasty and the horrible in sport. In fact, it seems a trend across a lot of sports but it is almost intolerable to see it on the cricket field. As someone who has followed and played the game all my life, it is not a nice thing to witness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Donald Bradman has touched on this, as have others, including the late great Alan McGilvray. They referred to it as `sledging'. For that I substitute `cheating and boorish behaviour'. I am ashamed to say that Australian cricketers at a senior level have become past masters of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now see it in junior cricket. Some years ago, I was umpiring cricket at the junior level. I must say that it was something that I felt was an absolute blot on the game. I would no&hyphen;ball a bowler who came in and had the rest of his team talking to the batsman before he had delivered the ball. That was not in the rules of the game, but it cut it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have the suggestion of a strike. I do not mind saying with absolute unequivocation that the people who are playing cricket for Australia are grossly overpaid now. To hear some commentators extolling the current Australian cricket captain for his ability to let balls go outside the off stump merely serves to highlight my point&mdash;and he is the highest paid of the lot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Cricket Board, in my view, needs to take a very firm stand on this issue. I am sure there are plenty of excellent cricketers around this country who would don the baggy green cap for nothing. When we think of the great Australian cricketers that have gone before the current brace, some of them should look into the history books and examine their current behaviour.

On that occasion, members will recall that I was having a little stoush with the member for Paterson (Mr Baldwin) over a stunt he had run on the cooked chicken meat importation issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members will recall that the member for Paterson lodged a private member's motion for 27 October. The motion was a strongly worded condemnation of the proposal to import cooked chicken meat into this country. But, as I said at the time, the motion was a stunt because the member for Paterson knew, as I knew, that there was not a hope that that motion would get on for debate before the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) made his announcement on the decision&mdash;something everyone knew was imminent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members will recall that the opposition gave the member for Paterson the opportunity to have his motion debated on 29 October, but he declined the offer. Surprise, surprise! On Friday, 7 November, just nine days after he was given that opportunity, the minister for primary industries announced his decision to allow Thailand, Denmark and the United States to import cooked chicken meat into this country. Despite all the posturing and loud noises from the member for Paterson, who promised to cross the floor on the issue but when given the opportunity flew the coop, the decision has now been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But my electorate office is receiving lots of calls. People in my electorate are confused. They do not understand why on that evening on NBN and Prime television the member for Paterson was popping the cork and drinking champagne, celebrating the minister's decision. They cannot understand why the bloke who was going to cross the floor was celebrating. `Hasn't the government approved the imports?' they ask my office. The member for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Paterson's newspaper column did nothing to clear the matter in their eyes. Let me read part of his column to the House. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you haven't yet heard, my Herculean fight to protect the chicken industry, our region's largest rural income earner, has been vindicated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a ground breaking announcement last week, the Federal Government, via the nation's quarantine authority AQIS, has blocked any cooked chicken meat imports from Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But when you read the AQIS media release, it clearly says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Imports of cooked chicken meat from Denmark, the USA and Thailand will be allowed into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a direct quote from the AQIS media release. So here we have evidence of the member for Paterson misleading the people of the Hunter region once again. He is on the news popping the champagne cork as if he has blocked cooked chicken meat imports and in his columns he said those things. Let me give another quote from the same column. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me repeat, the chicken industry, our supermarkets and sandwich shops will continue to wholly and solely stock Australian chicken.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What an extraordinary claim to make. This is blatant misleading of the electorate&mdash;an electorate that relies so heavily on the chicken growing and processing industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Paterson will be in here in the adjournment debate tomorrow night, no doubt, responding. He will say that the more stringent cooking requirements the government has imposed will mean that less chicken will come into this country. For the sake of the argument, and for the sake of moving on, let us grant him that for the moment, let us just humour him for a moment. What about the hygiene issues? What about the human health issues? What about the fact that we know that none of the Thai plants nominated have HACCP systems in place. That is why the minister will not release the report of the delegation that visited that country. We do not know what is the situation in Denmark and the USA because we have not had any delegations go there.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise as a member of the federal government accused by the chairman of the Cape York Land Council and Aboriginal advocate, Noel Pearson, of being `racist scum'. I rise also as a human being, an Australian who holds the view that, whatever else this nation achieves, if there is not an improvement in the health and living conditions endured by indigenous Australians we will  have achieved nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title is new for Australia. It is a concept to which we are only beginning to adjust. It is as complex as it is unpredictable. This generation has a moral responsibility to right as much as practicable the wrongs of the past. Central to any legislative or cultural response to the Wik postscript to Mabo is the eternal question: how would I feel if this were done to me?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The traditional Aboriginal bond with land is said to be unlike that experienced by any other group of people&mdash;a deep and enduring love, conservation and celebration of the country, which has frequently been described to me as `mother'. Only one other group come close&mdash;people who see the whole of their lives, both cultural and physical, as being bound up in their relationship to land. They are people who, despite years of natural disaster and negative incomes, occasionally have to be removed at gunpoint by creditors who `don't understand'. They are called pastoralists. Out of this modern tragedy for our country, pitted against one another at times, are two groups of people who have a relationship with the land that I will never begin to understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title is being upheld by the government. Of concern is not the principle of the High Court's decision in Wik but the way it relates to the retrospectively flawed Native Title Act. What good will it do the most 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> impoverished and most disadvantaged people in this country, Aboriginal Australians, if the battle for one-sided native title law is won but the war against preventable disease and existential despair is lost? With almost three-quarters of Australia now potentially under claim, and with it wealth generating potential from which those with neither power nor influence ultimately benefit, economic certainty for primary industries is security for us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who could not feel a sense of anguished shame at the injustices of the past&mdash;acts that must be understood if reconciliation is to mean anything at all? I think an unembellished recounting by Aboriginal people separated from their families forcibly in past generations to a joint sitting of the federal parliament would be a good start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us, both black and white, and all of us from all political parties have a great responsibility to forge with restraint the future which is now upon us. Reconciliation will not ever be found in a statute; nor will perfection ever be seen by all parties in the 10-point plan. Two hundred and twenty years of European domination, settlement and property law cannot be unravelled easily, whatever the nobility of the cause. The time has come for reason to prevail in recognising that our responsibility is as much to the future as it is to the past. But in doing that we need to understand and be reconciled with our past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who use the word `racist', whomever they are, do so to diminish the currency of their message. Those who lack restraint frequently fail to achieve their own goals no matter how worthy they may be. Those who covet greatness without restraint will not ever succeed. Sometimes we all have to rise above our own self-interest and the perspective of our own position and seek to understand as best we can the position of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nation is at a turning point in its history at the moment, and we have a great opportunity and an enormous responsibility to see that we come to terms with one another and our past. We need to support those things that serve the long-term interests of the nation. This is one such time, and I call on Mr Pearson, I call on some from the pastoral industry and I call on people in this place to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a southern coastal boundary of Paterson electorate lies Stockton Rifle Range, where thousands of troops were trained during World War II. The range is in good order, the mounds are well maintained and the mechanism for raising and lowering the targets at the butts is immediately behind a wall of shifting sand dunes. Sufficient of the targets are maintained by various rifle clubs that use the range. Regrettably, the army, over time, has removed some of the target mechanisms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immediately adjacent to the northern edge of the rifle range are four anti-aircraft gun emplacements and several above-ground slit concrete trenches that led to the command post during wartime. Slightly further to the north beyond the hind dunes is a heavy weapons proof testing area and several concrete gun pits that were positioned to repel a possible beach landing by the Japanese.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The weapons are gone but the gun pits, the heavy concrete access road, building foundations, a strong room and sections of various buildings remain among the wattle brush and amongst the foliage in that area. Together they constituted the northern perimeter defence of Port Newcastle, with its vital steel, shipbuilding and coal industries. These heritage assets belong to the people of our region. The Department of Defence has a responsibility to protect them, not to destroy them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that the Department of Defence has advised the rifle clubs that they must vacate the rifle range by 14 December 1997 so that demolition of structural or built impediments to development of that range can begin immediately. We must not allow this to happen. The proof range area I mentioned is under the control of the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service. Adjacent to it on the western side is land for which rezoning is being sought for housing purposes. I believe that this land will not be rezoned but ultimately will become part of the Stockton Bight National Park.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hunter coastal defence system began at Swansea Heads in my electorate. A boom net was in place across the entrance to Lake Macquarie. A little further to the north, at Cold Tea Creek, was the Belmont anti-tank ditch installation, which was designed to halt the northward movement of Japanese should they land on the beach north of the entrance to the lake at a place called Blacksmiths. The anti-tank installation was a southern perimeter defence of Port Newcastle, having been constructed in mid-1942. Some of the soldiers who participated in this construction are alive and with us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From Swansea Heads to Belmont, the continuing beach defence barbed wire system, Shepherd's Hill, Fort Scratchley and Fort Wallace, Stockton Rifle Range, with its anti-aircraft guns and the northern perimeter defences, stretched a comprehensive defence system of Port Newcastle. Stockton Rifle Range and its anti-aircraft gun emplacements are vital items of our defence heritage that were built in a time of great crisis at the only time in our history that our region was attacked by enemy forces. The shelling of Newcastle by a Japanese submarine in June 1942 is testimony to the perils of that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every resident of our region, every ex&hyphen;serviceman and every ex-servicewoman is entitled to see the rifle range and the gun emplacements retained for future generations as part of our defence heritage. I ask the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) to give an assurance that no demolition of any kind will take place at Stockton Rifle Range or nearby. I ask the minister that these heritage assets be fully protected until a comprehensive heritage assessment is carried out of the range, the butts, the target mechanism and the anti-aircraft gun emplacements nearby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The range can be maintained free of cost by the members of the clubs that use it. As a rifle range and a defence heritage asset, it can be a valued part of our tourism infrastructure. Few people in our region know the butts in the proof range and the northern perimeter defence systems; they do not know they exist. They have never heard of the anti-aircraft gun emplacements. They are concealed by the wattle foliage and the vegetation that has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10557"> grown through the area since World War II. What is there belongs to the people of our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dunes behind the butts are mobile and would have to be stabilised at considerable cost before any development could take place. It is ironic that a few weeks ago the chief of the defence forces, General John Baker AC, was at Williamtown air base seeking the support and cooperation of business and community leaders for the participation of their employees in the part-time defence forces. I ask now the Minister for Defence and General Baker to respect our defence heritage assets and ensure that they are retained for future generations to help them understand the peril in which our region was placed during World War II.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10557"><TITLE>Job Placement, Employment and Training Program</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Friday, 24 October, I had the very great pleasure of launching a job placement, employment and training project in my electorate of Makin. The project in Makin will be administered by the Salvation Army Ingle Farm Community Service. One of the most very important jobs of this government is to facilitate the creation of jobs, particularly for our young people. Unemployment is the most pressing social problem Australia currently faces and the successful resolution of this issue must remain our main aim. The JPET program will help more than 8,000 young people throughout Australia. This employment growth initiative will create 90 nationwide programs at a cost of $11 million. I believe this is money wisely spent to help young people find employment and give them that opportunity to control their own destinies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The project in my electorate has received from the Howard government funding of $107,980 to provide assistance to the young homeless. Members on this side of the House understand the difficulties faced by some young people in gaining the necessary skills and experience needed to find employment. For those of our young who are homeless, finding employment without assistance is almost impossible. That is why I was so pleased to be able to be part of something as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> positive and as practical as the Howard government's JPET scheme. Unlike previous programs, JPET provides real opportunities for the unemployed by assisting those who have been working with the young homeless people and who know first&hyphen;hand the difficulties and the pressures they face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Salvation Army is a magnificent institution which deserves the full praise of each and every member of the House. I am extremely proud of the people involved with the Salvation Army Ingle Farm Community Service. People like Colonel Alan Walker, who came from interstate, and Captain Casey participated in the launch of the Pooraka JPET project, as did other members of my local community who have demonstrated their commitment to the community in which we live&mdash;people like Pat St Clair Dixon, the former mayor of Salisbury, who is now working in a volunteer capacity to help the carers of the north and north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide. I would also like to thank Counsellor Peter Panagaris, Deputy Mayor of the City of Tea Tree Gully, and the Hon. John Dawkins MLC for their support for the JPET project in Pooraka.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Pooraka JPET project will provide young homeless people of Makin with assistance to find a safe place to live and help them to rebuild their confidence and self-esteem. Too often our young people lose hope. John Howard's JPET program restores their hope and their pride in themselves. The Pooraka project will involve such things as adventure camping and various other outdoor activities which will lift the motivation of the participants and assist them to develop interpersonal skills through team activities. There will also be referral to drug&hyphen;alcohol rehabilitation and support programs for those who need it. Work experience and training will also be part of this project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Past governments created expensive programs which did little to solve the tragedy of unemployment but which gave their instigators a warm inner glow. The JPET program, however, is something different. It provides funding for the community so that the community can work to resolve the problems it faces. With a grant of $100,000, the Salvation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10558"> Army can do more practical good work than a thousand centralised bureaucratic programs with fancy names and glossy programs. At the end of the day, JPET will provide real hope and real jobs for those young people who are most in need of our support.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10558"><TITLE>New South Wales Liberal Party</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to place on the public record some concerns about the current state of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party and to demand a democratic plebiscite for the bona fide members of the Liberal Party in the federal electorate conference of Cook&mdash;that is a vote of all financial members&mdash;to determine their candidate for the next federal election. I am the only federal Liberal member in New South Wales to face preselection. This is despite the personal intervention by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and an agreement, subsequently made public, which has been blatantly disregarded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the best efforts of the Prime Minister, the currently dominant faction in the New South Wales Liberal Party, known as the `group', has shown no regard for the stability of the party or respect for his authority. Although I for one acted in good faith on the agreement, to my own detriment, I should perhaps have realised the perfidy of these people. Over the last few years their disregard for the democratic procedures of the party has become endemic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have written a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winner take all</EMPHASIS>, which is an account of the misuse and abuse of the rules and procedures of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party in the federal electorate conference of Cook. The report sets out the manner in which the `group', using Young Liberal activists, other willing opportunists and many dupes, has manipulated loopholes in the rules and procedures of the division to gain control of the federal conference. My report deals with, among other things, Young Liberal double dipping, pre-AGM branch stacking, central payment of memberships, the inappropriate rejection of memberships and intimidatory and offensive behaviour.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales division is unique in the Liberal Party in its tolerance of these rorts, which are generally outlawed in other divisions. The unwillingness of the division to rectify these wrongs is a reflection of the fact that the effectively governing body of the division, the state executive, is under the control of `group' operatives. Despite the fact that I have raised serious complaints that my wife has been physically harassed and slandered and that supporters have been abused and intimidated at meetings, including elderly members, my complaints have fallen on deaf ears. For a party that presumes to stand for decent behaviour, this apparent lack of concern has been profoundly disappointing. I am not prepared to tolerate the orchestrated abuse to which my wife and I and our supporters have been subjected at ordinary Liberal Party meetings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) According to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) Aircraft Occurrence Report 9101112 into this incident, the weather in the Melbourne area at the time was clear, with good visibility. Runway 34 was in use and visual approaches were required. The aircraft, which was approaching Melbourne Airport from the west, was radar vectored onto base leg and descended to 3000 feet. At 1704 hours Melbourne Approach Control advised the crew that their position was nine miles south&hyphen;west of the field. They were asked to advise when they had the runway in sight and also to say when the runway 34 lead&hyphen;in strobe lights were sighted. Shortly after, the crew responded that they had the runway and strobe lights in sight. Approach Control gave the crew their position as six miles south&hyphen;west of the field, told them to make a visual approach and not to descend below one thousand five hundred feet until established on final. At 1706 hours the controller told the crew they were approaching the runway extended centre line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Approach Controller noted that the aircraft was passing through the extended centre line and had not turned to line up with runway 34. He promptly issued instructions to the aircraft to climb to 2000 feet. At about the same stage the crew realised that the runway they had been looking at was too short for their operations and also decided to go around. Further radar vectors were given and the aircraft subsequently landed normally on runway 34 at Melbourne Airport without any other problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The BASI Report finds that Runway 35 at Essendon Airport was the runway sighted by the pilots. It does not have lead&hyphen;in strobe lights. The crew indicated they must have seen reflections near Essendon which they mistook for strobe lights. On the approach the crew had seen a runway from a long way out, which they thought was the north/south runway for Melbourne Airport, but was in fact runway 35 at Essendon Airport. In the

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) BASI has advised that their investigation into this incident did not find any breach of safety procedures, such as a breakdown in separation, nor  did the investigation make any recommendations concerning the strobe lighting. The FAC has advised that no further action was taken after this incident.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Refined petroleum customs and excise rates of duty are indexed and can change in February and August each year based on Consumer Price Index movements. Fuel excise rates have also been changed due to such factors as changes in the Crude Oil Import Parity Price. In addition, under the previous Government the rates were also changed for Budget revenue purposes. The attached tables detail the changes in fuel excise rates for the period 1983 to May 1997.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The only Medicare data available to my Department on the use of alternative therapies by general practitioners is for attendance at which acupuncture is performed. A table of services and benefits paid under this item since 1992 is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The number of general practitioners billing Medicare for the acupuncture item since 1992 is shown in the attached table. There are no other items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule for alternative therapies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Medicare Schedule fee for acupuncture (Item 173) is $21.65. Doctors are free to set their own fees for all items on the Schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Government is not providing funding for the proposed national centre for the teaching and research on alternative medical techniques. Its composition is a matter for the alternative medicine industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The question of extending Medicare benefits coverage to a wider range of allied health care, has been considered on a number of occasions in the context of periodic review of the national health care system, including Medicare. However, the previous government decided on each occasion that it was not possible to extend these arrangements and in the current climate of economic restraint this is still the case.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="10570" SPEAKER="Williams, Daryl, MP" NAMEID="7V5" ELECTORATE="Tangney" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Attorney-General" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V5">Mr Williams</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Justice has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) On 5 June 1997 the Prime Minister officially launched the National Campaign Against Violence 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and Crime. He announced a commitment of $13 million to the Campaign over 3 years. One of the Campaign's priorities for its first year is residential burglary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The National Campaign Against Violence and Crime has commenced work on a Residential Break and Enter Project. In consultation with jurisdictions and experts in the field, the National Campaign Against Violence and Crime is determining the most appropriate project design for implementation. Funds will be provided to a jurisdiction to implement a demonstration project. It is hoped that the demonstration project will reveal the most cost&hyphen;effective strategies to prevent residential burglary, which can then be implemented nationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) While it is accepted that some burglary and other crimes are perpetrated by offenders who abuse drugs, I am advised that it is not correct to say that there is an established link. This is due, in part, to difficulties associated with establishing motives for such crimes and reporting procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Co&hyphen;ordinated by the Department of Health &amp; Family Services, the former National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, now the National Drug Strategy, was established in 1985 and involves the non&hyphen;government sector and all governments working together "to minimise the harmful effects of drugs on Australian society". Since 1993 the Commonwealth Government has provided $200 million to states and territories under a cost&hyphen;share arrangement for a wide variety of treatment and prevention programs on alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs. In addition, the Commonwealth has given $66 million to national drug programs and also contributes significantly to health and law enforcement programs to address drug and alcohol issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the existing resources available to agencies to combat drug abuse, the National Campaign Against Violence and Crime will not duplicate existing efforts. The main aim of the Campaign is to develop and encourage best practice nationally, across a broad range of crime areas, through liaison with jurisdictions and informed community aware 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10571"> ness. The Campaign will work towards reducing crime by developing a series of demonstration projects in each jurisdiction, which actively work towards and promote best practice for crime prevention in several areas, including residential burglary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) My attention has been drawn to the paper by Mr Marks of the Australian Graduate School of Management on the estimate of the costs of Australian Drug Policy. As advised, the report does not establish a direct link between burglary and drug addiction. Nevertheless, research is continuing into the causes of criminal behaviour and programs such as the National Campaign Against Violence and Crime are being developed which aim to reduce crime through best practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) I am advised that the little data that exists on crimes motivated by drug misuse is drawn largely from interviews with convicted heroin users. The 1997 Evaluation of the South Australian Methadone Program provides a few figures on drug related crime. The Evaluation cites a 1993 report detailing that 90% of methadone applicants had been convicted one or more times, 78% for property offences. A 1992 study found that methadone treatment helped lower crime rates, with 25% less property crimes occurring during methadone treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other than the above figures I am unable to provide more up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date figures because, as stated in the 1995&hyphen;96 Australian Illicit Drug Report, "there appears to be little research in the field of drug related crime". For the reasons given in (3) above, figures such as those produced in 1991 by Mr Marks, are not available at this time. In a 1996 report, I am advised, the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission suggests that while heroin users commit more fraud, burglaries and robberies than non&hyphen;users it also states that not all heroin users 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> source their addiction through crime. Furthermore, heroin users only make up a small proportion of drug users overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The National Campaign Against Violence and Crime does not, at present, have specific projects aimed at reducing drug abuse and addiction as a means of fighting crime. Nevertheless, the Campaign Unit is aware of the correlation of drug and alcohol problems with crime and will be looking at these issues through some of the current projects where drug abuse and addiction may emerge as an issue to be addressed. These include Early Intervention and Developmental Approaches to Crime Prevention, Domestic Violence Prevention, Domestic Violence Perpetrator Programs, Preventing Violence &amp; Crime at Public Events, Negotiating Young People's Use of Public Space, and Violence in Indigenous Communities.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)&mdash;(2) Neither the department nor my office keep records of all requests for interviews.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) At the time of my answer to question No 1696, analysis of 1995 data on the number of opiate&hyphen;related deaths in Australia was not complete. As indicated in the answer to question No 1696, the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre undertook work on behalf of my department analysing available information on opiate&hyphen;related deaths on a jurisdictional and age group basis. That analysis was not available then but is available now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) There are limitations in the coding system used for the ABS data on causes of death. For example, it is not possible to distinguish between suicides caused by opiates and suicides by other drugs such as tranquillisers. It is also not possible to distinguish between accidental poisonings due to heroin, methadone and other opiates. The analysis undertaken by the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre focused on deaths coded as being due to drug dependence and accidental poisoning amongst adults aged between 15 and 44 years. These deaths are most likely to be due to heroin or methadone, but are not exclusively so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Based on the information published in the 1995/96 Annual Report, Essendon Airport's financial performance (profit/[loss] before interest) in relation to other secondary airports is as follows: Bankstown*&mdash;$678,000; Moorabbin&mdash;$30,000; Parafield&mdash;$[40,000]; Archerfield&mdash;$[347,000]; Jandakot&mdash;$[612,000]; Essendon&mdash;$[1,114,000] *(includes Camden and Hoxton Park).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Figures for the 1996/97 financial year are not yet available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The FAC has indicated that owing to the uncertainty about the airport's future, the FAC was only able to offer long&hyphen;term leases (up to 25 years) between 1992 and 1995. At other times since 1988 leases have only been able to be granted for periods ranging from one month, one year or five years. Since 1988, all other FAC airports were consistently able to grant leases at all times for consider 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10582"> ably longer periods, eg twenty&hyphen;five years for aviation purposes and longer for major non&hyphen;aviation developments. The FAC believes that these restrictions, together with continued uncertainty over the future of the airport and the need to obtain support from the State Government and local community for particular kinds of development, resulted in considerable revenue loss to the Corporation from developments which were otherwise considered likely to proceed. The FAC considers that removal of the restrictions and uncertainties will enable the airport to produce very satisfactory financial results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The FAC 1995/96 Annual Report shows that Essendon Airport's contribution to the FAC's profit as being $[1.1 million]. This included the non cash item of depreciation which when removed, shows Essendon Airport contributed $772,000 towards the Corporation's overall profit.</PARA>

This increased to about 240 tonnes by 1969, and to about 250 tonnes in 1979. The Bank's holdings did not change materially thereafter, until it sold 167 tonnes in the first half of 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Reserve Bank's gold holdings were acquired over a period of time up to 1979, and at a variety of prices. The average stock cost in the Bank's accounts at the time of the sales was $46.49 per ounce. The Reserve Bank estimates that this is equivalent to about $254 per ounce in 1997 dollars. The average price per ounce for the 167 tonnes which the Bank sold forward in 1997 was $455.42.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Until 1976, gold was obtained by the central bank, under part IV of the Banking Act 1959, from gold producers in Australia. In 1977 and 1978, a small amount was obtained from the International Monetary Fund as part of a general disbursement of about one third of its gold holdings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sales of gold in 1997 were made generally into the gold market through an agent. The Reserve Bank has no information on who the ultimate buyers were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) 167 tonnes of gold was sold in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) The proceeds have been invested in securities issued by the governments of the United States, Germany and Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The decision to sell the gold was made by the Board of the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The decision to sell the gold was made in December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) The gold was sold because, in the assessment of the Reserve Bank's Board, it was difficult for a country such as Australia to justify holding a substantial part of its official reserve assets in gold. In addition, the reinvested proceeds should yield higher annual profits for the Reserve Bank than if they have been retained as gold. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) The Treasurer was informed of the Bank's decision when the Bank sought his approval for the Bank to use the funds for reinvestment in other reserve assets. This approval was given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g) In taking its decision, the Bank considered the benefits to Australia would outweigh costs through any short&hyphen;term impact of the decision on the behaviour of the price of gold. By 1 October 1997, the price of gold was above the level it reached just prior to the bank's announcement of the gold sales.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention marked "#" is for implementation by Commonwealth law and practice alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The approach to ratification of Conventions by Australia is that this occurs only where two preconditions are satisfied, that is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> law and practice in all relevant jurisdictions is in compliance with the Convention in question, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> all State and Territory governments have formally agreed to ratification (except for those Conventions whose subject matter falls within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Government alone).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, consistent with the requirements of Convention 144, Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards), 1976, which was ratified by Australia in 1979, the Commonwealth also consults with the most representative employer and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10599"> worker organisations (ACCI and ACTU) on matters relating to the adoption, examination and ratification of ILO Conventions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The procedure outlined above was carried out in relation to the ILO Conventions ratified by Australia since 1987, with two exceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When the Commonwealth ratified Convention 156, Workers with Family Responsibilities, 1981 in March 1990, it did so without the formal agreement of New South Wales and the Northern Territory. There was compliance with the provisions of the Convention at the time of ratification, and the Commonwealth wished to ratify on the 15th anniversary of International Women's Day. The two jurisdictions subsequently provided their formal agreement to ratification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Convention 158, Termination of Employment, 1982 was ratified in February 1993. Law and practice was not fully in compliance with the provisions of the Convention, and the Commonwealth legislated using the external affairs power to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Convention before it came into force. None of the States and Territories provided formal agreement to ratification either before ratification or subsequently. The then Minister stated that ratification was a "special case necessitated by the removal or possible removal in a number of jurisdictions of previously accepted employment conditions".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) In future if a Convention is ratified it will be done so according to the usual procedure. Furthermore, the requirements of the Government's new treaty making policy which was announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in May 1996 will be taken into account. Briefly, this will require text of any ILO Convention proposed for ratification to be tabled in Parliament for at least 15 sitting days before the Government takes action to bring the treaty into force. A National Interest Analysis (NIA) must also be prepared, in consultation with interested parties, and tabled prior to ratification. The Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties may inquire into and report on treaties (including ILO Conventions) and NIAs that are tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) There is no timetable for ratifying the remaining Conventions. The Commonwealth and States and Territories continue to meet and assess the position regarding each Convention but there is no obligation or commitment to ratify.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. A national standard for fine particles is being developed by the National Environment Protection Council as part of the proposed National Environment Protection Measure (NEPM) addressing ambient air quality. A draft of the proposed Measure, which will include a standard for fine particles, and an accompanying impact statement, will be released for public comment before the Measure is finalised and adopted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The national standard currently under consideration in Australia is being established to protect human health and well being. With respect to the protection of human health, guidelines developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) are widely considered as indicators of world's best practice. However, it should be recognised that WHO `guidelines' are not equivalent to `standards,' a fact explicitly acknowledged by WHO which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The guidelines are intended to provide background information and guidance to governments in making risk management decisions, particularly in setting standards. It should be strongly emphasised that the guideline values are not to be regarded as standards in themselves."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of fine particles, WHO have not established a guideline because of the absence of a threshold below which there are no identifiable adverse health effects.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Mr Phillip Adams appeared in a 7.30 Report story on the subject of talkback radio on Monday 13 October 1997. He did not "promote" his book, although the fact that he had written a book about talkback radio was mentioned in Kerry O'Brien's introduction to the story. Mr Adams was invited to appear on the program as a well known radio personality and someone known to be critical of the power of talkback radio, as well as in his capacity as the author of the book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The story was about the relative power and attitudes of Australia's talkback radio stars, of whom Adams is generally critical. The ABC endeavoured to ensure that Mr Adams' views were tested and balanced with those of talkback stars. John Laws, Alan Jones and Stan Zemanik were all approached to be interviewed, but declined. File shots of them, overlaid with audio of their radio shows were used. Two talkback personalities who appeared were Steve Price (Melbourne 3AW), who was critical of the book, and Howard Sattler (Perth 6PR) who was highly critical of both the book and Mr Adams personally.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I have agreed to introduce a transaction based levy on sheep, lambs and goats at the request of the Sheepmeat Council of Australia and the Goat Industry Council of Australia who have demonstrated to my satisfaction the proposal has clear majority industry support and satisfies the Government's levy principles. The matter was widely debated and all views considered prior to the decisions being taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sheepmeat Council of Australia advises the proposed transaction levy was discussed with representatives of potential levy payers including Wool Council of Australia and all major State-based farming organisations. The levy was also discussed with other peak industry bodies including the Australian Poll Dorset Association, the Australian Corriedale Association, the Australian Texel Stud Breeders Association, the Australian Meat Council, the National Meat Association of Australia and the Australian Council of Livestock Agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Secretary of the Western Australian Livestock Salesmen's Association wrote to me 9 September 1997 advising of their support for a slaughter based levy collected by livestock agents and processors, but paid for by producers under a "pass-back" mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">No action was taken on this proposal as it is clearly the majority industry decision that a transaction based levy be introduced for sheep, lambs and goats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the national representative body of livestock agents, the Australian Council of Livestock Agents, are strongly opposed to the suggestion. These members would be responsible for collecting almost all the producer levies under a "pass-back" slaughter levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am also advised that a "pass-back" slaughter levy was in place briefly in the early 1970's, but was abandoned due to administrative difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Sheepmeat Council of Australia expects that the transaction levy, subject to further industry negotiations aimed at lowering operative rates, will raise approximately $16.5 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The funds collected from the transaction levy will be used for four purposes as designated in the legislation; marketing and promotion, research and development, animal health and the national residue survey.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The Sheepmeat Council of Australia and industry will determine the funding priorities in consultation with Meat and Livestock Australia Limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The Meat Research Corporation (MRC) has advised they estimate the tax losses could be in the order of $20 million. They also advise that these losses are unlikely to be available for use once MRC has ceased to exist. In any event, the chances of MRC being able to obtain value for these losses has always been minimal. MRC itself is tax exempt and it has no prospect of generating sizeable taxable earnings via subsidiary companies in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the transfer of tax losses for value to a third party business entity is subject to extremely tight rules which are, in practice, very difficult to satisfy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government and industry clearly support the development of high priority value enhancing technologies through research and development. To this end, the Commonwealth already provides matching funding on eligible research and development expenditure.</PARA>
