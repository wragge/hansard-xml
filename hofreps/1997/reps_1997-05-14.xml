<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Australian National's operations, in common with many other government owned railways, are characterised by a large and increasing debt and a declining market share. The performance of rail stands in stark contrast to the road transport sector, which has been very successful in addressing customer needs and therefore increasing its market share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To a large extent this situation reflects the fundamental problems arising from government owning and operating businesses that are more efficiently conducted by the private sector. In particular, government rail authorities have in many cases over the years largely operated as monopolies, have often been subject to political interference and have not been placed on a fully commercial footing. Under these circumstances, pricing, operating and investment practices tend to be unresponsive and inflexible. If real reform is to be achieved in the rail sector, it is vitally important that the inherent deficiencies associated with government ownership be replaced by a dynamic market driven approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems confronting AN, however, have been substantially magnified by the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. In particular, AN has been left with very large debts while the large bulk of its profitable operations have been transferred to NR. Furthermore, AN has been required to provide 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> NR with significant services at well below cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government became aware of the extent of AN's problems shortly after taking office. I commissioned the independent Brew review, which revealed a situation requiring urgent remedy. Increasing debt, a loss of business and escalating taxpayer subsidies were aspects of AN which the former government both ignored and failed to address. I want to make it clear that the financial mess at AN was not the result of AN staff or management, but the result of decisions made by the former government which left AN in an impossible position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, I announced on 24 November last year a $2 billion reform package to rejuvenate the rail sector. The reforms will impact through the separation of the management of the interstate rail track network from above track operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major benefit of structural separation lies in replacing the incentives for anticompetitive and uncommercial behaviour with an incentive to maximise the number of operators on the network. The Commonwealth's role will concentrate on controlling and managing economically efficient and non&hyphen;discriminatory access to the interstate rail network. This will allow the interstate rail network to operate largely as the roads do now: government owned, but open, upon payment of an access fee, to anyone licensed to operate a vehicle over the network. Such a change can only be of benefit to the users of rail transport and indeed to the economy as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is the first legislative step in achieving this important component of micro&hyphen;economic reform. The injection of private sector expertise into rail operations will reduce costs, improve service responsiveness and increase rail market share.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The proposed bill</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill 1997 gives effect to the government's decision to sell the non&hyphen;interstate mainline track rail assets of Australian National in whole or in part. It provides a flexible framework to facilitate:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3478">
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> authority and mechanisms for the sale, including authority to repeal, replace or amend rail agreements with South Australia and Tasmania following their agreement to sale arrangements; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reduction of AN to an entity charged with dealing with any residual functions and the balance of assets and liabilities not included above, or not able to be disposed of in the short term, and resolving outstanding litigation and disputes prior to abolition.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A viable rail industry</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AN has been offered for sale as a single unit or by component parts such as interstate passenger operations, vertically integrated rail freight operations in South Australia and Tasmania or railway workshops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AN's rail operations have been restricted in their operation by corporate overheads and the burden of debt. Recognising that this arrangement is not sustainable, the government has decided to offer AN for sale free of debts and liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is proposed that companies be established under the Corporation Law to be the vehicles through which the sales occur. The assets of AN necessary for the operation of each component of the AN business will be transferred into a company by ministerial direction listing the assets, or classes of assets. The shares in the company will be sold to a new rail operator. The liabilities of AN would be retained and paid out by AN or transferred to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thus, the bill proposes flexible arrangements for the transfer of assets, liabilities and contracts between AN, the Commonwealth and a new rail operator. To provide maximum flexibility to a purchaser, it is not proposed that any staff transfer to private sector purchasers. Instead, it is proposed that staff be made redundant on sale or closure of the part of AN in which they work. There will be no requirements or arrangements in the sales process for the transfer or re-employment of employees and general industrial relations legislation will determine award provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new operator will not be burdened by existing liabilities or inappropriate staffing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> structures and can develop arrangements consistent with a viable transport company.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Incentives to improve infrastructure</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states have interests in a large proportion of AN owned land under the 1975 agreements, which transferred railway assets to the Commonwealth. It is proposed that the land revert to the states for them to lease to a new rail operator. It is important that the sale arrangement create an incentive for an injection of funds to improve and maintain the rail infrastructure. Ownership of infrastructure is considered a key part of providing this incentive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To achieve an infrastructure ownership arrangement under land lease, the bill proposes that railway land fixtures such as track, signalling equipment, culverts, buildings, et cetera be severed from the land by the sales legislation for sale to the new operator with above track assets.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Agreements with the States</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has legislated a range of agreements with the states over the years. Some of these need to be amended or repealed to allow the sale to proceed. The government is negotiating with South Australia and Tasmania on these issues and is confident of reaching agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shares in each new company established to operate a business previously within AN will become part of a sales agreement between the Commonwealth and a private sector purchaser. The bill proposes that the Minister for Finance be authorised to sign an agreement with the purchasers of these new companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is envisaged that these sales agreements will be a key mechanism by which Commonwealth commitments under the agreements with the states will be honoured. Sales negotiations with prospective purchasers cannot be finalised until the parliament agrees to the sale and new agreements have been reached with South Australia and Tasmania. The bill thus proposes that:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I be empowered to enter into new agreements with the states;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3479">
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> those agreements be given legislative force through regulation able to be disallowed by either house of parliament;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the various acts authorising current agreements with the states be repealed on the day on which new agreements take effect; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> any agreement executed in this way be approved and its performance and observance by the Commonwealth be authorised.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">AN financial obligations</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes a range of provisions which are intended to both protect the Commonwealth from default by AN as a result of the loss of assets and revenue generating capacity and guarantee the debts of AN in order to protect companies which have contracted or loaned funds to AN in good faith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These proposed provisions include the expansion of Commonwealth guarantee powers and provisions to enable the Commonwealth to discharge AN obligations from funds appropriated for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendments to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AN is established and operated under the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983. The bill proposes a range of amendments to the act to enable the commission to assist the Commonwealth in implementing its rail reform objectives in relation to the commission. It also provides a power of direction which enables the Minister for Finance to direct AN in the disposal of its assets and liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the sale process, AN will shed all its rail operations other than the ownership and management of interstate track. The bill proposes transitional arrangements, including allowing flexibility to reduce the structure and size of the commission as the business contracts and providing the means to transfer residual assets, liabilities and contracts to the Commonwealth and to abolish the commission when it has wound down sufficiently. The bill also proposes the amendment of a range of existing legislation to facilitate the sale and in consequence of the abolition of AN.   </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future of rail in Australia lies with using our current system much more efficiently and effectively, through encouraging the participation of the private sector, introducing competition and providing a greater customer focus. It is possible for the rail industry to operate profitably, and this will require substantial programs of cost reduction and capital investment by the private sector, accompanied by improvements in service quality. It is these initiatives that will give us a viable long&hyphen;term rail industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation underpins the government's rail reform package and is essential to its implementation. The reform package has a number of elements but, in particular, seeks to revitalise rail transport by separating the provision of access to essential infrastructure&mdash;the interstate track&mdash;from the provision of rail transport services, which is more appropriately the role of the private sector. Passage of the legislation is crucial to the attainment of the government's timetable for the sale as it will enable the government to sell AN assets and services, clearly signalling the government's commitment to reform. It will also directly increase participation of the private sector in the rail industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AN is losing money and is in an unsustainable and declining financial position which is unlikely to be improved in the current environment of uncertainty. The extensive restructure required to generate an efficient and profitable rail system is best able to be achieved through government divestment and the injection of private sector transport expertise. This is also the best long&hyphen;term guarantee of employment in the rail industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prompt passage of the bill will mean that elements of AN can rapidly be divested and will thereby reduce uncertainty for AN, its staff, other participants in the rail industry and the community. Delays in sale will unnecessarily increase taxpayer liabilities and adversely effect the government's budget strategy. I commend the bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum of the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill has two primary purposes. The first is to introduce new arrangements by which agencies are able to obtain warrants authorising the interception of telecommunications for the investigation of serious criminal offences. The bill's second principal object is to strengthen arrangements for dealing with police corruption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interception of telecommunications by law enforcement agencies and subsequent dealing with intercepted information are regulated by the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. That act provides a detailed scheme of control, designed to protect the privacy and confidentiality of communications passing over the Australian telecommunications system. A general rule of our society is that a communication of this kind is private to the participants. Intrusion into a communication, even by the government's law enforcement agencies, is subject to strict control. Interceptions can only be carried out by declared Commonwealth and state law enforcement agencies and only under the authority of a warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, interception warrants may be issued by an eligible judge of a court created by this parliament. An eligible judge is one who has been nominated by the responsible minister, after having consented to perform the function. The statutory requirement for individual consent underlines that issuing a warrant is an administrative power conferred on a judge as a designated person. The bill proposes to provide for categories of persons, in addition to judges, who may be authorised to issue warrants.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments are necessary because the eligible judges of the Federal Court have decided that they should no longer perform this function. I understand the judges have expressed a quite proper concern that the workload involved should not interfere with the performance of their judicial duties. In addition, there is a more fundamental issue involved. The High Court has recently indicated that the use of judges as designated officials to perform certain administrative functions may be incompatible with the judicial function, as it can undermine public confidence in the independence and integrity of the judiciary. The High Court has also specifically advised some judges against agreeing to issue interception warrants, because of the risk that the judge may subsequently be involved in a related proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will confer the authority to issue interception warrants on certain members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal who are nominated for this purpose by the responsible minister. The potential pool of nominees would be the deputy presidents and full-time senior members, as well as those part-time senior members and members&mdash;all of whom are part-time&mdash;who have legal qualifications. This new arrangement takes into account the special character of the authority to issue an interception warrant. The purpose of the issuing process is to provide an opportunity, before the event, for the conflicting interests of the state and an individual to be assessed, so that the individual's right to privacy will be affected only where the appropriate statutory standard has been met and the needs of law enforcement are demonstrably superior.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For such a process to be meaningful, the person making the assessment must be capable of doing so in a neutral and impartial manner. The government believes that the specified members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal have both the independence and experience necessary for this role. However, an individual will only be given the authority to issue warrants after he or she is nominated by the minister. There will be an opportunity, before an eligible person is nominated, for consultation with the president 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3481"> of the tribunal concerning their experience and background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes that the new arrangement set out in the bill will maintain the integrity of the warrant issuing arrangements. I should also point out that the amendments do not in any way alter the provisions which permit judges to issue warrants should their views change at some time in the future. The bill introduces similar new arrangements for issuing listening device warrants to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies, under the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Customs Act 1901. These warrants are also issued at present by federal judges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the provisions in the bill that are directed against the serious problem of police corruption. Most significantly, the bill contains a number of provisions relating to the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission. The commission has recently been established as a permanent authority to continue the work of the Wood Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service. Members will be aware that the Wood Royal Commission uncovered disturbing instances of corruption and other serious police misconduct. The Commonwealth supports the government of New South Wales in its efforts to excise the cancer of corruption from within its police service and is ready to assist in providing the new commission with appropriate and effective powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Experience has shown that covert surveillance is one of the most powerful investigative tools for uncovering and prosecuting police misconduct. The bill will amend the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 to permit the Commission to receive and use intercepted information originally obtained by other law enforcement agencies, where the information relates to a matter the commission may investigate. The amendments also open the way for a declaration to be made which will permit the commission to apply for warrants on its own behalf, once the Attorney-General, as the responsible minister, is satisfied that the statutory preconditions of a declaration have been fulfilled. These amendments do not involve any effective widening of interception powers. The respon 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sibilities of the Police Integrity Commission for investigating police misconduct have generally been transferred to it from the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the New South Wales Police Service. Both these latter agencies are already able to apply for interception warrants for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill further supports the Police Integrity Commission in other ways. Amendments to the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 will give the commission, as well as the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, access to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre's database of reportable transactions. In addition, amendments to the Customs Act will permit the Australian Police and the National Crime Authority to communicate information those agencies obtain by means of a listening device directly to the commission, where the information relates to the commission's functions. Without this amendment, the Commonwealth agencies would only be able to pass listening device information about police corruption to the commission via the New South Wales Police Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several of the amendments deal with more general aspects of police misconduct. The bill will permit the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to use intercepted information in deciding whether to appoint, re-appoint or dismiss a member or staff member of the AFP. This amendment is a response to a decision in the Federal Court to the effect that the Commissioner was not permitted to rely on intercepted information relating to corruption by an AFP officer in a decision not to re-appoint that officer. The government considers that position to be inconsistent with the Commissioner's responsibilities to keep the AFP free of corruption and the power given to the Commissioner over appointments within the AFP. The bill also contains an equivalent provision in relation to other police services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to other amendments. The bill will permit intercepted information to be given in evidence in three categories of proceedings that relate to the commission of prescribed offences. One category provides 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3482"> for an application for bail that relates to a prosecution for a prescribed offence. This amendment is a response to a decision by the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in the case of Director of Public Prosecutions v Serratore which held that a bail application is not part of a related prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also permit intercepted information to be given in evidence in applications for restraining orders made under Commonwealth and state proceeds of crime legislation. The effectiveness of this legislation, particularly in relation to drug offences, depends on the ability of prosecuting authorities to obtain orders preventing assets from being dealt with pending the outcome of related criminal proceedings. This amendment is to clarify the legislative position following the Serratore decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third category of proceedings is a coroner's inquest, if the coroner considers the subject of the inquiry&mdash;for example, a suspicious death&mdash;may have been caused by the commission of a prescribed offence. The purpose is to avoid a situation where a coroner is prevented from receiving evidence that may be vital to the coroner's determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the bill contains a number of other amendments related to the use of intercepted information and record keeping obligations. The amendments have no significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill I rise essentially to support the remarks made by my colleagues, in particular my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham), who led for the opposition on this matter. It is appropriate that this bill was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> introduced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) because the bill has features which characterise our current incumbent, Mr Howard, as Prime Minister. It is a bill that shows absolutely no leadership. It is a bill that shows absolutely no vision. It is a bill that is consistent with the increasing tendency of the Prime Minister to sully everything he touches. Here he is trying to rort the ballot for this constitutional convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague the member for Banks went into great detail about the flaws in the electoral arrangements in this legislation, and I will seek to do so in the time available. But what I really want to comment on first is why are we finding these incredibly convoluted arrangements which have, for the first time, the people of Australia confronting a bizarre, unorthodox set of voting arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially it is because the government is trying to hide its real intention from the people and trying to hide from the real intentions of the people. It does not want to face up to the fact that the opinion of the Australian people has changed and that the majority of Australians want a change in our constitutional arrangements. The Prime Minister knows that he cannot present a unified position on the fundamental question of the nature of our constitutional arrangements on behalf of the coalition parties. So he has to hide, obfuscate and confuse and seek to debase the fundamental debate about the nature of our constitutional arrangements when in fact the issues can be stated very simply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the United States you have to be a citizen of that country, you have to have been born in that country, to be eligible to be head of state. In Australia you are debarred from being the head of state if you were born in Australia. That is the stark position that Australians no longer accept. We do not actually need a constitutional convention to deal with the consequences of that conclusion that Australians have come to in clear majority. We should just give them a vote, a proper, decent, Australian ballot. Our great democratic contribution to the world is the Australian ballot. Let us use it to say to the Australian people in a plebiscite: confirm what the opinion polls say, that you believe an Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3483"> ian should be eligible to be the head of state of his or her own country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not hide. Let us have the debate. Come out from wherever you are hiding, Prime Minister, and say what you think. Let us all express our various views, let the people decide and then we will have a constitutional referendum to determine and formalise the process and make the proper constitutional decisions. But no, what we have is this thoroughly unsatisfactory, thoroughly unreasonable bill setting up this unnecessary convention in this improper way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would not be so bad if the implications for some of our longstanding and proud democratic traditions were not quite so serious. There is nowhere to hide from the determination of the Australian people to achieve a republican constitution&mdash;and they will achieve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone who has spent a long time associated with our electoral system and with our democratic processes, I am particularly worried about some of the implications of the changes that are in the legislation. Let me start first with the issue of voluntary voting. The idea has been put around by influential people in the Liberal Party for some time, particularly by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Senator Minchin. To his credit, Senator Minchin has at least been open about it. He has advocated his position in public. I do not agree with his position but I respect the fact that he has come out openly and has said, `This is what I believe and this is why.' That has facilitated a decent debate. I know it has facilitated a decent debate within the coalition parties and between the parties in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly disagree with Senator Minchin's position, but he has been up&hyphen;front about it, unlike the Prime Minister, who has introduced a bill for voluntary voting but has never once actually said he agrees with it. He has never once said, `I think voluntary voting is a good idea,' but he has come in here and introduced a bill to start us down this slippery slope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I worry that it is the first step on the path to taking the concerns of the disadvantaged off the agenda, to removing from the democratic agenda of Australia the concerns of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those Australians least likely to vote. Everybody knows&mdash;the evidence is overwhelming&mdash;that, when you take away compulsory voting, those least inclined to vote are those who need the assistance of government most. Those to whom the attention of government should most be directed, the most disadvantaged, are those least likely to vote and, therefore, from whom the political focus will shift towards those most advantaged in our society who are most likely to vote because they have interests they wish to protect. To be debasing that great Australian tradition of the compulsory secret ballot on this occasion is something of profound implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then move to the idea of having a voluntary postal ballot. If we put those two things together, what are we saying? We are saying that the vote about whether Australia should be a republic is less important than the vote about what our national song should be. In 1977, we had a ballot in Australia about our national song. I voted in that ballot. I have to say I did not regard it as one of the great exercises of my democratic prerogative.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly cannot sing. I actually know the words of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Fair</EMPHASIS> . I have this secret pact with my electors: if they continue to support me, I promise not to sing it out loud because I am totally out of tune. So far the deal is working. Unlike some, I am keeping that election promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than eight million Australians turned up to the polling booths around the country and voted in 1977 about what the national song should be, but I do not think any of them would have thought that it was a vote of profundity equal to what should be the fundamental nature of our constitutional arrangements in this country. Yet then that conservative government was prepared, quite correctly, to use the normal voting arrangements for Australians and we all trooped down to the ballot box and voted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government gives less weight to the ballot for this convention than to that ballot. If they do not take the convention seriously, there is a simple solution: do not have it. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3484"> better solution is we do not have the convention at all. But, if we are going to have it, take it seriously, elect it democratically, do not set out as a matter of conscious public policy to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Australians. Everybody knows that this will disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Australians. There is a debate about how many, but not a debate about the fact that there must be hundreds of thousands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At any one time, there are 200,000 Australians overseas. None of them will get an effective chance to vote in this ballot. The biggest polling booth in any Australian election is in London. More people vote in London than in any polling booth in Australia, and the second biggest is in Hong Kong. The ballot paper will not be posted to them overseas; it will be posted to their home address, their registered electoral address. The prospect that they will get it forwarded to where they might be away on holidays, get it in time, get it back and have their vote recorded is very remote. So there are a few hundred thousand Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what about our electoral laws that cover ordinary elections and that applied in the ballot for the national song so that for those many thousands of Australians who need assistance to vote have a right to come along to the polling booth and receive assistance from the Electoral Commission&mdash;the visually impaired, others who need assistance? There is no Electoral Commission assistance for them here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true they can probably invite a neighbour in, probably get their son or daughter. What happened to the secret ballot? `I'm not sure what this means. I'd better get Tom down the street to come and vote for me.' Not only now have we lost our compulsory vote, not only have we lost the capacity to turn up down at the local polling booth and have a secret ballot, the Australian ballot, but now we have even lost the secret ballot for all those who normally need some assistance because of the nature of their English language skills, their visual impairment or other infirmity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a conscious, deliberate attempt to disenfranchise those people not because I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> think they are worried that all those people are republicans, although I suspect the majority of them are too, but because they really do not want people to take the outcome of this too seriously. They do not want a majority vote in the republican direction to have too much weight. If everybody voted in the normal way and the majority of them voted for a republic, it would have awesome weight and we do not wish to have that democratic imperative inserted into this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the outcome of this ballot does matter. If you are worried about the cost and think this is too expensive a way to do it, I come back to my previous solution. There is an easy way to save the money. Do not have the ballot; do not have the convention; go straight to a plebiscite&mdash;that is, if you think democracy is not worth the money. But if you are going to have this convention, if you are going to have this ballot, do it properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the anti-republican people consider the numbers important. We had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) saying, with the capacity of the government to make a lot of appointments, with the way the government's proposals rort the appointment proposal for members of parliament so it is overwhelmingly in favour of the conservative parties for the first time ever in a convention like this, that it is not even, it is gerrymandered, it is stacked in favour of the conservative parties. The bad news is that a few of those people are republicans, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, this is the first time anybody ever tried to stack a constitutional convention. But even after that the parliamentary secretary says that the vote might only be about 88-64 in favour of a republic and hardly an overwhelming mandate for change. These conservatives are very strange people. They say that, on those figures, 57 per cent is not much of a vote for change. The corollary is that 43 per cent is a great vote for the status quo. That is the thinking that has dominated the manipulation of electoral laws by conservatives for centuries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come from Western Australia. They have rigged the electoral laws in that state since we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3485"> have had voting. For 106 years, the conservatives controlled the upper house of that state. They have lost election after election in the lower house, even though those ballots have been rigged too&mdash;but in 106 years they had never lost an upper house election, until last year, and they were shocked. They said, `For 106 years we have controlled the upper house. It belongs to us. The people made a mistake.' So what do they do? For the first time in 106 years they take advantage of the fixed term nature of the upper house to rip through the most unfair industrial relations laws in this country ever so they can get them through before 22 May, before the vote of the people would prevent it being passed. One hundred and six years of domination is not enough. They have to rort the  constitutional arrangements against the workers one last time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So a 43 per cent vote for the status quo is pretty good. A 57 per cent vote for change would not be much of a mandate. This is fundamental testimony to the unfairness of the arrangements we are confronting. Why have such peculiar arrangements? Why, once we go through all these machinations, can't we at least have ordinary Senate voting arrangements, not this complex set of arrangements? Everything is being done to make it harder, not easier, for people to express their views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle is not complicated. If you are going to have an election, the outcome of the election should reflect the intention of those eligible to vote. It should be a collective expression of the intent of those 10 million Australians eligible to vote. That is what it should be, and it will not be. It has been deliberately designed to make sure that that does not happen. The most basic democratic principle is that the outcome of the election should represent the intention of the voter. They are trying to make it hard for them to vote, make it hard for them to get there to express their vote and easy for it to be rorted and they have stacked the convention and then changed the voting rules so it is complicated. The principle is not the one I articulated&mdash;that the outcome of a ballot should be the collective intention of the Australian voters. The principle is: how can we hide from the people's will; how can we avoid the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> political damage inside the coalition of a debate about the republic?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message in this debate to the Prime Minister, who introduced this bill, is simple: show some leadership, not just in this matter but on jobs and on the fundamental moral debates going on in our society about race. On this matter, have the courage to outline what you believe, put it before the people and let them choose. Do not be too frightened. Do not be there hiding away because you cannot decide, because you will not lead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future of Australia does not lie in that direction. The proper determination of our constitutional arrangements for the 21st century will not be decided that way. This convention is not necessary. It is not even a good idea. But if we must have it, let us be honest about it. Let us be honest about how it is established. Let us be honest about how it operates, about what it discusses and how it will be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bill that needs very substantial amendment. I welcome the fact that the opposition, through the member for Banks, and us, through our shadow Attorney-General, Senator Bolkus, have outlined that comprehensive range of amendments. If those amendments are to be passed, we might be able to get a process worthy of the high ideals that Australians seek to have reflected in the debate about their constitution. But this bill as it stands debases those high ideals.</PARA></SPEECH>

They will also be given the democratic right not to vote if they choose not to vote through the postal ballot system for this constitutional convention and for the members to be elected by the people of Australia to that convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that the member for Banks said during his second reading speech he will be introducing are basically saying that they do not want the people to have their say. The most important thing in this question is that this parliament is not the decision maker on whether we should have a change in the constitution. The people who have the right are the people of Australia, and they will have that right as they will have the right to make the decision on who should represent them at the convention to discuss the matter and make the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard also from the member for Prospect and the member for Canberra about the call for a plebiscite. We have heard that one before. We heard that from the previous Prime Minister for 12 months to two years. But the Labor Party always refuse to acknowledge&mdash;as the member for Canberra did today&mdash;when they discuss the right for people to make the decision through a plebiscite to nominate whether we should have an Australian head of state, how that person should be elected or appointed. Maybe they are in a dilemma; maybe they do not have an answer to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to this House that we are having this constitutional convention so that people 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from all walks of life in Australia&mdash;half of them nominated by the Australian parliament and half of them elected by the Australian people&mdash;shall discuss the best way to put that question to the Australian people. We do not believe that it is the position of this parliament or this government to make that decision. It is the position of the convention to put that point of view forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard from the member for Prospect and from the member for Canberra again that we have never had an Australian as a head of state, albeit that the Governor-General is the head of state on behalf of the Queen. But in the 1930s we had Sir Isaac Isaacs, who was an Australian. There was a bit of a quiet lull until the early 1960s. Then we had Viscount De L'Isle from 1961 to 1965. I believe he was Australian born.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1965 on we have governors-general of Australia who have all been Australian born. Did we need to have that written into law or written in the constitution to ensure that? No, we had coalition governments and we had Labor governments during that period of time from 1965. We had several from both sides, but both governments upheld the convention that they believed was right and from that day we have had an Australian born head of state. So I think it is a bit hypocritical for the Labor Party to infer for some reason that we do not have an Australian born head of state in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bet I can. Let me now refer to a few of the points that I want to make with regard to the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill. In addressing this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3487"> bill, I believe that it is important to point out that a constitution is only as good as the government in power. There is no doubt that the citizens of some countries have suffered loss of freedom and abuse, despite a fine sounding constitution. There are constitutions which have been constructed to allow the government in power to continue to make changes without having to go back to the people, something I certainly do not agree with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other countries have made changes to confirm and strengthen their constitutions. Indonesia, Malaysia and South Africa are just three countries which have made changes to their constitutions in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the late 1800s Australians put a great deal of thought into our current constitution. In the lead&hyphen;up to Federation there was much debate and discussion in the colonies. In fact, it is considered by some historians that the people of Australia were more involved in creating our constitution than the people of any other democracy. As a result, our constitution has held firm for just under 100 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Personally, I belong to a group of people who believe that, if it isn't broken, don't fix it. But quite obviously many of my constituents are considering the need for a change. It is my job and that of my fellow members in this House to ensure all our constituents are kept fully informed to ensure they understand the nature of any proposed changes and the results of these changes for their lives. It is also our duty to ensure that all opinions are heard, not just those of some individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was dismayed at the manner in which the Keating government launched its campaign for an Australian republic led by an Australian president. The previous government beat the republican horse around the track in this country until it looked as though the RSPCA would have to be called in. There was evidence to suggest the issue was whipped up by the previous government purely for political expediency. I am still far from convinced it was an issue high on the public's list of political priorities. This was totally borne out when the then Prime Minister dropped the issue. Suddenly it was no longer a major media story, and the voices which had been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so strident in the public arena suddenly went silent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I believe enough debate was engendered to indicate there was public interest in the subject&mdash;enough for this government to acknowledge the need to address the matter. But this government has not whipped this matter up into an urgent priority; rather, it is to be considered at a respectable pace. We are creating a constitutional convention to address the question of whether or not Australia should be a republic. In a calm and rational manner we are attempting to do that. It is important everyone in Australia has their say. But first it has to be decided whether or not our present constitution should be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just like to come back to something the member for Canberra mentioned in regard to people being disenfranchised, and he particularly talked about people overseas. A few hundred thousand, I think he said, might have some postal problems and might not be able to receive and send back their ballot papers in time. When I spent some time overseas, I put in place arrangements for my mail to be adequately dealt with. I am sure that the people who are overseas have also done the same to look after their interests in this country.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important, as I said, that everyone in Australia has their say. This will require public debate. The public will be represented by 152 delegates. Half of those will be elected by the people and half appointed by the government. My state of Queensland will be entitled to 13 public delegates. I believe there are community representatives in my electorate of Griffith who would be most appropriate to take part in this important national debate. This is a time we need representatives from all corners of the community&mdash;young and old, male and female and of the many diverse ethnic groups which make up this wonderful nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as our constitution was widely discussed and debated at the turn of the century, so it will be thoroughly debated again. The Prime Minister has put in place a program of education and information. This includes the immediate implementation of a comprehensive and effective nationwide program to ensure as many Australians as possible understand our democratic process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both federal and state governments will work to ensure all school students have an understanding of the constitution. It is intended this program will include active participation by way of debates around constitutional reform, taking into account the linguistic and cultural diversity within Australia. The convention also includes a program of public involvement and cooperation with the members of parliament. This constitutional convention will come at considerable expense and therefore must be conducted properly to ensure a fair outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Keating government's campaign was not one of education and information but a political brief to divert attention from the alarming state of our economy at the time&mdash;and, might I say, I believe that was adequately addressed last evening.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is of course not the first time that this nation has had this kind of debate about its national identity. For example, back in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1948 the Australian parliament debated and legislated for the Nationality and Citizenship Bill. I am proud that it was a Labor government, the great Chifley Labor government, which initiated and carried that legislation. But I think that, with the passage of time, we can all be proud of the decision taken to legislate to create that category of Australian citizenship, which up until that time did not exist. Until that time, we were all regarded as British citizens. At that time, there were people who argued that we should not create Australian citizenship&mdash;that that would impair our allegiance to the British motherland. That view should not be dismissed as ignorant or frivolous but ought to be seen as a product of its time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time, Australia had made unprecedented sacrifices during the Second World War. We had taken the historic decision to welcome a great many new migrants to build up this country after the Second World War. We realised then, and we have realised with increasing force ever since, that Australia had a new and more independent role to play in the world. So we created Australian citizenship. Does anyone seriously now think that that was the wrong step to take?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we are once again at one of these turning points and we have a similar situation now: Australians have recognised and are recognising with increasing force that it is quite inappropriate that we do not have an Australian head of state, that we do not have our own head of state. I think it was brought home to many of us in this place last year when we had the visit from President Clinton and the toast at the lunch where the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) toasted President Clinton and President Clinton, by way of response, toasted the Queen. I cringed at that time and I think many other people in the room cringed at that time. If I recall correctly, one of the Liberal members of parliament indicated that that event on its own was enough to convince them that it was time for Australia to take that next step towards becoming a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had some excellent contributions in this debate so far and a number of important points made. For example, we have had 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3489"> pointed out that the succession to the British monarchy and therefore to the Australian monarchy is limited to Protestants. We have had pointed out the fact that males are preferred to females in the line of succession. We have had pointed out the fact that this seems entirely inconsistent with our own constitution&mdash;section 116&mdash;which says that no religious test should be applied for public office holders. We have also had in the debate the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) make a splendid Freudian slip where he said, `Why not the Queen of England&mdash;the Queen of Australia, I should say?' What a Freudian slip that was because, when all is said and done, she is the Queen of England.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had ample demonstration of that in the last year or two with the controversy over French nuclear testing in the Pacific. I think most of us would see the role of a head of state as being an essentially non-political role and would not want to see our head of state involved in anything which looked like partisan political controversy. But occasionally there are issues which are such matters of national importance that we regard it as important that our head of state has something to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of French nuclear testing in the Pacific was one of those issues which people in Australia felt so strongly about that it would not have been out of order for the head of state to have been making observations about that issue. Yet the Queen of England&mdash;being advised, as she was, by a British government which was reluctant to say anything which might offend France&mdash;was certainly not going to say anything on that issue. I am pleased to say that, with a Blair Labour government, if we have a similar circumstance arise again we might well have a government in Britain which is prepared to take more note of Australian concerns and priorities. But this sort of example also brings home to us the inappropriateness of having a monarch of a foreign country as head of our own nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I have some sympathy and a great deal of respect and admiration for the role which has been carried out in a very distinguished way over many years by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Queen of England. But it also has to be said that the royal family in recent times has found itself in difficult circumstances. I also have some sympathy for the fact that in large measure they have been done over by the Murdoch press, and I think any of us can feel some sympathy for people who find themselves in those circumstances. But however strong the case may be for having Australia retain its present constitutional arrangements while the Queen remains the monarch, it seems to me that the personal lives of the members of her family are in some disarray and that the baton should not pass to the next generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the member for Griffith (Mr McDougall), said&mdash;and I have heard many Liberals say this in this debate&mdash;`If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' In the same speech, that member said compulsory voting ought to be abandoned. Compulsory voting, which has served this nation so well and has helped make us one of the finest democracies in the world, is something that he is prepared to abandon, notwithstanding the `if it ain't broke, don't fix it' test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal government opposite does not apply that test to the sale of Telstra. The Liberal government in Victoria does not apply that test to the carve&hyphen;up and sale of the SCC in Victoria or to the sacking of democratically elected councillors in Victoria. What about the workplace relations bill? We had industrial disputation in this country down to record low levels. What about the contracting out of services and the compulsory competitive tendering, all of which have played havoc with notions of public service? What about Working Nation, which was bringing down unemployment in this country to five per cent by the year 2000? All of these things have been working well, yet the Liberal Party is prepared to flog them off, to destroy them. So they should be the last people to come into this House and say, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, we have had a high quality, thoughtful debate on this bill. We have had very good contributions from the member for Banks (Mr Melham) and the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3490"> the other side in support of a republic, and the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan). Frankly, I think they were much more thoughtful contributions than this bill deserves, because it is a really shabby, mealy-mouthed bill from a government which has been dragged kicking and screaming to do this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of common knowledge that the Prime Minister is a monarchist. But he was frightened, prior to the last election, of losing that election due to growing republican momentum and sympathies within this country, and he was afraid of internal strife within his own party. Indeed, what a fractious lot they are! They are back at it again with Wik and so on. He was afraid of the voters, so what he proposed was this convention, which turns out&mdash;as this bill makes clear&mdash;to be a very dodgy exercise indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Labor says is: let us have a vote. Let us put this issue to the people. Let's have an indicative plebiscite and, if people indicate that they want a republic, that they want an Australian head of state, let us move to draft the constitutional changes which would be necessary to put that into effect. But, instead, they are giving us this Dodgy Brothers exercise which will not have any real legitimacy or credibility, and indeed they do not want it to. They do not want to see this constitutional change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first problem with this exercise is that it is limited to a solitary issue: the issue of the head of state. We have always seen some merit in this, but then why do we need this convention? If that is the sole issue to be determined, why shouldn't it be determined by the nation right now through a direct election? Secondly, half the convention is to be appointed in a blatant stacking exercise. If this government is genuinely democratic, genuinely wants a people's convention to sort the issues out, then why not elect the whole lot of them&mdash;the 100 per cent? It is a blatant stacking exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third problem that we have with it is voluntary voting. As the member for Canberra and other speakers pointed out, voluntary voting carries within it a great many flaws which will deprive a great many Australians of the opportunity to vote and, in doing so, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will reduce the credibility of the whole exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, we have a postal vote. There are opportunities for fraud and there are security issues which have not been adequately addressed. We have contained within that the loss of the secret ballot. The secret ballot is a peculiarly Australian contribution to the world and it is part of our great democratic heritage. If we abandon things like the secret ballot, then we are not on the way to becoming a republic but on the way to becoming a banana republic. I have to say that any trade union which had its elections conducted the same way that is proposed here would have the result knocked out in a flash. It would simply not be accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position that the government puts before us is a voluntary postal ballot. The Australian Electoral Commission has admitted that up to two million Australians may not receive their postal ballot simply because they have changed their address since the time of the last election. The material on the ballot will be available only in writing and in English. That will tend to disenfranchise Australians who are blind, older people, frail people, people who are illiterate or people who lack English language skills. Presently, many of those people receive a great deal of assistance when they attend at polling booths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation through the postal ballot where they will not have that assistance available to them. The postal ballot also will not be distributed to Australians who happen to be overseas at the time of the ballot. As I understand it, the Australian Electoral Commission is not going to conduct a habitation review to get its rolls in order prior to this election being carried out, so we will have a lot of people missing out on a vote. It has been estimated that up to a million people will miss out on a vote due to this process alone. I note that Chris Puplick has observed that the whole thing could be in breach of New South Wales anti-discrimination legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of security of the ballot, Australia Post, as I understand it, is taking no special measures to ensure that people cannot have their postal votes tampered with. As I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3491"> understand it, people will be required to put their date of birth on the outside of the envelope so that the whole thing can be verified. It is of course a matter of common knowledge that people like landlords, nursing home proprietors, even credit data agencies, student colleges and so on are aware of the dates of birth of various people. Lots of people are aware of my date of birth, I have to say. We do not have privacy legislation and we do not have guarantees of the security of this ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, we have an extraordinarily complex voting system being adopted. The ballot paper will have above and below the line voting, as the Senate system does. But, in a number of respects, it will be different from that which is used at the Senate elections. For example, group candidates will be represented on the ballot paper by only the name of the first candidate in the group and a short name requested by the group. The names of the remainder of the candidates within that group will not appear on the ballot paper. Instead, voters will have to refer to an accompanying booklet and will have to write the names of the candidates on the ballot paper in order to vote below the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was suggested that this process was okay, because it was something that many thousands of Australian punters do every week when they bet with the TAB, the way they transcribe numbers onto betting slips. As the member for Banks indicated, a lot of Australians take their betting very seriously, including one or two of my staff members and my campaign director. But the suggestion that an election for a convention to discuss such weighty constitutional issues should be likened to a bet on the Dapto dogs is quite insulting. It is not the system we should be using. We should be using the Senate style voting system. There is no legitimate reason why we should not have the Senate style voting system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To come to the appointed delegates, we have the government announcing that there will be 76 appointed delegates, 40 of those to be drawn from parliamentary representatives and the remaining 36 from the general community. Extraordinarily, what is being pro 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> posed is that in the federal parliament 12 delegates will come from the coalition, six from the Labor Party, one from the Australian Democrats and one will be drawn at random from the Independents and minor parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the state parliaments, the government will appoint the relevant state Premier, the Leader of the Opposition and one additional person nominated by the relevant Premier. That position advantages government parties and will deliver 25 coalition delegates, 13 Labor Party delegates and two members of minor parties or Independents. But it breaches the precedents established by the constitutional conventions held from 1973 to 1985, under both Labor and coalition governments, which saw equal representation within all parliaments of government and opposition members. As indicated before, that is clearly a stacking exercise and gives the lie to any idea that the government is serious or genuine in its commitment to a democratic outcome so far as constitutional change is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, Labor is proposing a number of strong amendments to this legislation which would make it a much fairer and more democratic bill and much more suited to the purposes for which it is allegedly designed. It would be a much more genuine piece of legislation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would require the holding of a compulsory attendance ballot. Voting would be compulsory. All voters would come to the polls, just as they do for ordinary national and state elections. We would regularise the voting system to bring it into line with the method of voting used for the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would increase the number of elected delegates to 80, to be chosen from the states and territories: 22 from New South Wales, 17 from Victoria, 14 from Queensland, nine from Western Australia, eight from South Australia, six from Tasmania, and two from each of the territories. We would provide for parliamentary delegates being appointed from the federal parliament to have eight members or senators appointed by the Prime Minister, six by the Leader of the Opposition, one by the Australian Democrats and one from the remaining minor party or Independent members or senators.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3492">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the states we would have four parliamentary delegates appointed from each state, with two delegates from the respective Premiers and two appointed by leaders of the opposition. In relation to the community delegates, where we are also concerned about the potential for abuse, we would establish a joint parliamentary committee who would choose those delegates by a two-thirds majority. We would further provide for an independent, non-voting chair to be appointed by a two&hyphen;thirds majority of that joint parliamentary committee. We have further suggested that Sir Anthony Mason would be an appropriate choice to head such a convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has many concerns about this bill. It is entirely inadequate. It comes from a government which has been dragged kicking and screaming in the direction of a republic and constitutional change. But we will participate in this because we have the conviction that it is time that Australians moved on to capture our own unique Australian identity and to do so through our own head of state, not because we have not seen through this bill for the sham that it is.

So as I said, by birth, heritage and inheritance I am a republican. But I have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> never been convinced totally of the need for us in Australia to change our form of parliamentary democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would remind honourable members and those members of the public who are listening that Australia has the sixth longest serving democratic political system surviving in the world uninterrupted by military takeover or dictatorship. Our history of parliamentary democracy is exceeded only by Great Britain, the United States, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland. I would also remind honourable members that, of those six, four are monarchical forms of parliamentary democracy, that is to say, a monarch in four out of those six remains as head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are about to have a convention to let the Australian people decide if we really should consider whether we need to change this system of parliamentary democracy which has, indeed, served Australia so very ably and so well. I have grave questions about the need for change and I have great questions about the mechanisms for change, if indeed we do decide to go down that path. I accept that there is, in the Australian community, a feeling that we are somehow not our own masters because our constitution is still, in effect, an act of British law and our head of state, while being Queen of Australia, is also Queen of Great Britain. I accept that many Australians genuinely believe that we need to set up our own head of state based on some formula, some system, incorporated into our particular form of democratic institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk briefly about that institution. We took from Great Britain, if you will, the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy so that the head of government is selected in the house of the people&mdash;the House of Representatives&mdash;by those individuals who can form a majority. In practice, it has meant that political parties form to provide an organisational base in order to make this system work. Individuals in those political parties may have varying and vast differences in philosophical view, in practical view, in how they would go about government, in how they would go about change in society and in how they would go about administering this democratic system in our country. But the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3493"> political parties exist and our system then allows the political party which wins the most votes at an election to select a Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, the Prime Minister and his senior cabinet advisers then advise the Queen of an Australian individual of great stature and great standing in the community to assume the post of head of state and the Queen simply confirms the Prime Minister's advice. Along with that goes the convention that the Governor&hyphen;General has wide powers, but powers which are not specified, not codified in print. Some of the proposals to create a new head of state called `President', or perhaps still called `Governor&hyphen;General', would have us codify those responsibilities and those rights of the Governor&hyphen;General. I have great concerns about trying to codify rights because I have seen what happened in the country where I was born in terms of the Bill of Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Codifying those rights has meant that their Supreme Court has, from time to time, come down with such disparate decisions on the same issue some years apart as to give little meaning to the codification itself. I put to honourable members that the words used when you legitimately try to codify those rights leaves open for great interpretation later individuals, later groups and later courts to decide that the structure itself has some other meaning than what it had when it was written down in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our Governor&hyphen;General is our head of state, our Governor&hyphen;General is an Australian, our Governor&hyphen;General is an Australian of great stature and of great standing in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did not take from Great Britain their upper house. We took from the United States a senate based on equal representation from each of the states and minor representation from our two territories. We took from the United States our High Court based exactly on the model of the Supreme Court of the United States. Then, just to make things confusing, we took from Switzerland a referendum system which allows us the mechanism to change the constitution, but based on only allowing it to be so changed if the people agree. A majority of the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> voting population must agree to a change and a majority of the states must also by a majority agree to the change. That has given great stability in our system. It has meant that our constitution has been amended only a very few times, and I think it is an excellent system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Altogether, we have in place a series of checks and balances on executive action of government. The first of the checks is, in fact, the Senate. We all know how the Senate acts as a check. We have seen some of the Senate's obstruction both when Labor was in power and now while the coalition is in power. Many Australians think that is good; some think it is not so good. Some think it would be better if government could set an agenda, get on with that agenda and report back to the people at the next election&mdash;three years after the first one. But others believe, legitimately, that our system now works well. So the Senate provides a check on executive government running away with itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states, themselves, actually provide an effective check on executive government because they run their own agendas and budgets and they can create immense pressure on the Commonwealth government to follow a lead of the states. The office of Governor&hyphen;General, itself, is a check on abuse of executive power, as is, of course, the High Court, which is liable to review, on request, any law that we make in this place, regardless of the majority that voted for it in approving that law or that statute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Altogether, we have a series of checks and balances that acts to reduce the power of the executive government and to help make it accountable to the Australian people. That is one of the very good things about our system. It is one of the things that has helped us to have such a stable democracy. I am concerned that, if we were to go to change our constitution, to remove from the constitution the Queen of Australia as titular head of state&mdash;not as practical head of state but as titular head of state&mdash;we may in fact create some unknown, unforeseen instability that could act to the detriment of the checks and balances or act to the detriment of our democracy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3494">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reminded that some proposals for a so&hyphen;called Australian head of state would have that individual elected by direct election by the Australian people voting in a ballot and a majority selecting the president. There are several aspects of that that concern me. The first is that some eminently qualified Australians undoubtedly would not wish to put themselves and their families through the trauma that sometimes attends hard fought election campaigns. It is a legitimate concern. The office of head of state in Australia is a very high office and we look to it not to run the government but for stability, for leadership and for a vision that Australia is represented by an eminent person who represents all of us in the community and indeed on the world stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The convention which this bill will enable will allow eminent Australians, some of whom have been selected and some of whom have been elected by the Australian people, to discuss the weighty issues around whether we should actually change the wording of our constitution and whether we should change the mechanism for the head of state, what powers the head of state should have, for how long they should remain in office and under what mechanisms they might, if ever, be removed from office other than voluntarily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The convention idea was born a number of years ago and it was in fact in direct response to Paul Keating's absolute dominance of the debate about the republican issue and his insistence that we had to move down that path: we needed to get rid of the Queen, we needed to get rid of the flag and we had to have a new Australia based on Paul Keating's model and Paul Keating's vision. The coalition rightly several years ago decided that was not a function for executive government, that was not function for a Prime Minister to decide, but that it was so important that it was a function for the people of Australia to decide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The convention grew out of that idea, in a sense replicating the conventions which led up to the constitution and the founding of our Commonwealth in 1901. So the convention not only is a laudable idea but in fact keeps our faith with the Australian people in that we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> promised in the last election campaign to bring forth such a convention and to listen to the convention and its advice and, if deemed desirable, to put that advice to the test of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) in his contribution said that voluntary voting would deprive very many Australians of their voting rights. I am sorry, but I fail to understand how that could be true, that voluntary voting is undemocratic and that voluntary voting deprives one of rights. I thought that we were a country that believed in free speech, in freedom of the press, in freedom of religion, in freedom of assembly and in freedom of association. In all these basic freedoms we are essentially free, within the bounds of restrictions imposed by society through laws, to pretty well do what we like, go where we like, say what we like and meet with whom we like. Yet we are told by the member for Wills that it is undemocratic that this voting mechanism for the convention be voluntary, that is, if you want to vote for the elected members of the convention you have the opportunity to do so but it is not required that you do so; if you have no interest in the issue and no interest in who will be participating in the convention then you are not forced to participate. I fail to see how that is undemocratic or how it deprives one single Australian of any voting rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the debate surrounding the idea of a change of head of state is based on a perception that we will feel better if we finally sever our ties with Great Britain, our founding fathers and mothers. I have to say I have been unconvinced by that symbolism&mdash;excepting that, when President Clinton came to visit us here and we had a state luncheon in the Great Hall and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) stood and toasted the United States of America and President Clinton stood and toasted the Queen, I must admit that I felt for the first time some disappointment in that symbolism. I guess for the first time I can understand why many Australians would seek to change the system. I do understand that the royal family is no longer as in favour with the general public, is no longer as in favour even in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3495"> Britain, as once it was. I understand that it is an old institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I also understand that it has weathered the time well. It has produced one of the world's greatest systems of democracy. It can trace its roots back centuries, and that is important. When we enter this debate, when a convention is held and when the delegates examine these issues, one of the things they will have to consider seriously is that all of the tradition, the history and the conventions built up through the years which act on the Governor&hyphen;General are very important. When we change the system, we may lose those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out to this House that Bill Hayden, as Governor-General, changed. When Bill Hayden was proposed as Governor&hyphen;General I must admit that I was somewhat less than enthusiastic. But Bill Hayden, as a Governor&hyphen;General, had not only my full support but also my admiration. The office itself changed him because he became subject to that heritage and subject to those conventions. He acted, throughout his term of office, in a manner that would have made his predecessors proud. He was a fine Governor&hyphen;General. Yet his background, his speeches and his inclinations as a real republican prior to that time were well known by all of us who are interested in politics and who follow political matters. The office changed the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the most important considerations. If the convention decides and if the Australian people decide that we need a different mechanism for selecting a head of state, then we need to do so taking into account the need to, as much as possible, preserve those conventions and that heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important issue surrounding this bill that we are debating here today is not the mickey mouse, finite detail that the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) went through. It is a fair system to select a group of Australians to sit in the Old Parliament House and to debate these weighty issues and to decide, in their minds, what the Australian people might decide on. It is a fair system and it will produce a fair outcome. It will be representative, in so far as that is ever possible, of the views of all Australians. They will examine in detail the issues that need to be examined

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) delivered an interesting speech, in particular with some very worthwhile content, regarding the inheritance of our system from Great Britain, the United States and Switzerland.

The member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) indicated how he felt a cringe and indeed I can relate a similar feeling when President Clinton stood up and proposed a toast to the Queen, not to the Australian people. That is regrettable. It is much more than symbolism: it is a question of our identity. That is why there is such momentum in the community for Australia to have its own elected head of state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is wrong and quite misleading to say that we are proposing a change to our system of democracy; we are not.

That document set out what are described as being `inalienable rights'. Those treaties which followed in the years as a result of civil wars and, finally, the bills of rights which give rise to our parliamentary system are all the basis of the principles contained in the United States system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not proposing changing our system of democracy in terms of the rights that each citizen of Australia has, nor are we talking about codifying any rights. We are talking about Australia having its own head of state. Indeed, I recall the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in his second reading speech on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill, was at pains to confine the task of the constitutional convention at the end of the year to that issue.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We in the government parties have always advocated that matters of national identity should not be party political issues.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In that context, it is quite disturbing that the government has proposed a system whereby the Labor opposition will have precisely half the number of appointed delegates the coalition will have. That is certainly not bipartisan, and it is certainly contrary to convention. In the September 1973 convention, for instance&mdash;at the Commonwealth level&mdash;the government and the opposition each appointed eight delegates. That was in the period of the Whitlam government. It is regrettable that this government has not seen fit to act in such a similar partisan way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that our constitution is out of date, and the member for Wills touched on many of those issues. For instance, when the constitution was drafted, there was no such creature as an Australian citizen. That occurred in 1948&hyphen;49 with the Australian Citizenship Act. Hence, we find in section 44 of the constitution a preclusion on anyone standing for parliament if they bear allegiance to a foreign power. On one view, it may well be that none of us here in this House are entitled to sit as members, because we have all sworn allegiance&mdash;in the oath which is the schedule to the constitution&mdash;to Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors. That demon 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> strates the fact that the constitution itself is anachronistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Queen Elizabeth is the head of state of a foreign power, and it is naive in the extreme to assume that Great Britain's interests are going to travel side by side with Australia's. It is not a question of Australia wanting to cut the umbilical cord. Great Britain has done that for us. They have well and truly cast us adrift. I am not being judgmental about that. They have seen their destiny in Europe and have cut away the favoured status we had as a colony and when the British Commonwealth was effectively a trading group. So it is not a question of us leaving them; they have pushed us away. To suggest that a person can wear two hats, as head of state of two countries, each with inevitably competing interests is, with respect, a very great fallacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that this constitutional convention arises from political motives. It was evidently the case during the last election, as opinion polls showed, that the majority of Australians most certainly favoured a republic. There was a fear on the part of the Liberal Party that the push towards republicanism would be reflected in a negative vote for the Liberal Party. So their strategists said, `We had better neutralise that.' In their policy document regarding the constitution, they made this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No matter who wins the next election, the Australian people will vote about the Republic. Therefore, no person who wants a Republic should feel that it should in any way influence his or her vote.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is that neutralisation of the pro&hyphen;republican vote in the last election which has given rise to the constitutional convention that we are facing at the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Australian people will not be voting for whether or not they want a republic. They will be voting for 50 per cent of delegates at a talkfest. It is not a genuine convention that has any formal status under the constitution in making recommendations or decisions which will be binding in any way. Regrettably, the whole process is going to tarnish the image of the convention and remove any credibility it will have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a speech earlier this year the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) referred to a Pryor car 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3497"> toon which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> as epitomising the whole process. I was also amused by the cartoon, which hit the nail right on the head. It was a picture of a citizen standing by a letterbox, posting their ballot paper for the convention delegates. The Prime Minister, dressed in his wet weather garb, with the rain teeming down, is saying to this citizen of Australia, `Okay, next you have to cross the Sydney Harbour Bridge on roller blades, wearing a G&hyphen;string and with this egg balanced on the tip of your nose.' Obviously, those complications would prove a significant disincentive to all but the most exhibitionist of us, including perhaps those on the front benches of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Disincentives are well and truly in the proposals contained in this bill. The voting system, which has been described by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), is so complicated that you would need a three&hyphen;year university degree on voting procedure simply to have a chance of casting a valid vote. Even after you have cast a vote, you have to complete personal details, including your name and address. The return ballot paper is going to be bar coded so that it can be computer tracked and, quite clearly, there is going to be a disincentive for people wanting to reveal that information and having that information retained about them. Moreover, the complications are going to affect illiterate citizens, citizens who do not speak English, the blind and the disabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The voting system itself is fundamentally flawed. I do not believe it constitutes a secret ballot, for the reasons I have mentioned, as a result of the ability to identify precisely who voted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, there have been a number of cases involving in particular trade unions but also Aboriginal land councils and other elections conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Office where the fact that it was possible to identify a voter resulted in those ballots being set aside. In several cases that I am aware of, evidence was taken from witnesses indicating that the lack of secrecy was a specific disincentive for them casting a vote. I believe that inevitably there will be that sort of challenge to the ballot later this year. As a result of that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> challenge, there is, in my view, doubt that the convention will even take place. If there is a court case, it may well delay for quite some time the occurrence of the constitutional convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second very serious concern is the fact that the roll of voters is significantly out of date. Any member in this House can tell you that when they do a mail&hyphen;out to their electorate, which is sourced from the electoral roll, they receive hundreds, often thousands, of returned letters as a result of people changing addresses. Indeed, I understand that about two million Australians a year change address. Given that it has been 18 months since the last electoral roll was prepared, we are looking at a potential three million people not receiving ballot papers. That is, quite frankly, an outrage. Again, there are numerous cases where ballots have been set aside because the returning officer failed to take all reasonable steps to locate people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the returning officer do in this case when, as will inevitably occur, at least one million&mdash;possibly two million&mdash;ballot papers are returned to him? Does he then try to track down those people? The dilemma he has is that, if he does not do that, the process again risks being challenged, as I believe will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, there is no plan to post voting papers to people overseas. One would think that members of our armed forces would have a very specific interest in the outcome of this ballot. Those who are serving this country overseas will be deprived of the right to vote for delegates because there is no procedure in place whereby those serving our country overseas can receive ballot papers. That is a real indictment of this government and the lack of respect that they pay to our service men and women who are serving this country so proudly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that those flaws are going to affect the bill. Unfortunately, it is not a secret ballot. I think it is fair to say that over the centuries countless service men and women have given their lives to protect our system of democracy, and this bill does not do them proud. It is a butchering of a true democratic process and an indictment of the government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3498">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said earlier, the bill is not a decision as to whether we will be moving towards a republic. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said in his response to the second reading speech, it is a pity that it is not a bill for a direct vote by the Australian people on the question of whether or not Australia should have an Australian head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no secret that what we in the Labor Party have proposed&mdash;and we believe should still occur&mdash;a process whereby, first, there is an indicative plebiscite to ascertain whether the people of Australia wish to move towards a republic. Secondly, if there is a yes vote&mdash;we believe there will be&mdash;then we favour the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee. Following extensive community consultation, that committee would report to parliament on questions to be referred to the Australian public by way of a referendum. The third and final process would be the referendum, which would occur in 1999 at the latest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If those procedures were followed, Australia would be entering the next century with a head of steam, with momentum, with optimism and with pride. Unfortunately, we will not be doing that; we will be looking back over a flawed voting process, giving rise to an extremely confused and convoluted constitutional convention process. The fact of the matter is that the procedures are so flawed that any view that comes out of this convention will be able to be challenged and disregarded. It is going to be meaningless. As a result of the complications, it will probably be years and years before Australia, regrettably, has its own identity through having an Australian elected as head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Be that as it may, the Labor Party acknowledges that at least this constitutional convention is a move towards the republic debate occurring in the community. In that sense, we will not be opposing the process occurring. However, we are proposing several amendments which would make the process more legitimate. They include, first, a compulsory attendance ballot and, second, a regularisation of this complicated voting procedure to bring it into line with the method of voting for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate. We propose increasing the number of elected delegates to 80, and they would be selected on the basis of the proportion of population in the states and territories.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with great interest to the debate yesterday and this morning on the constitutional convention. I do welcome the comments, most of them sane comments, from the opposition, although there are a number of points which I would like to address in my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point I would like to make is I do not want to pass judgment in this parliament today on the pros and cons of whether Australia sticks to its constitutional monarchy or whether there is a change which will have to be made eventually by the will of the people through a referendum to change the head of state. I would, though, like to inform this House that, as a backbencher, I have held a number of public meetings in the electorate of Richmond&mdash;in the towns of Byron Bay and Ballina, which have very different demographics&mdash;about the constitutional convention.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3499">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons I am delighted to speak on this bill, and one of the reasons we are having a convention, is to try to increase the public awareness about what the potential moves will be if we are to change Australia's head of state, what type of republican model will be adopted and, of course, what the timetable will be. There is an overwhelming hunger for more information out in the electorate about these issues. When we look at previous conventions, reading from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The People's Convention: Daryl Williams</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1891 National Constitutional Convention held in Sydney was attended by delegations appointed by the legislatures of the six Australian colonies and New Zealand. In a sense, it was a parliamentarians' convention.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As opposed to a people's convention, which we will be having in December. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Constitutional Convention of 1897&hyphen;98, however, comprised 10 representatives elected at large from each of the Colonies. Exceptions were Western Australia . . . and Queensland who sent nobody!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the delegates to the 1897&hyphen;98 convention were drawn from large fields of candidates . . . only one non-parliamentarian was elected. It is therefore not clear to what extent we can attribute the Convention's `success' to the fact that it was a popularly elected body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience has shown that the Constitution is difficult to amend . . . Electors have voted on 42 proposals to alter the Constitution on 18 occasions since Federation. Only 8 amendments have resulted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, if we are to go to a referendum on this particular issue, the public has to be informed if there is to be any clear mandate for whether we maintain the status quo or whether we change. As I mentioned before, the first reason for having this constitutional convention is to help increase public awareness across Australia. Obviously, the debate now has very much shifted from the original ALP position when Paul Keating was the Prime Minister and, indeed, from when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) made his speech after that of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 4 December. It is interesting to note that there has been a major shift within the opposition on the merits of the people's convention, although now it is rediscussing the details.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to highlight former Prime Minister Keating's proposal of 14 February 1996. That proposal was to put to the people a plebiscite on the question: do you want an Australian to be Australia's head of state? Indeed, this was further confirmed by the Leader of the Opposition on 4 December 1996 when he proposed a three&hyphen;step process to advance the republican debate. That process would involve, first, an indicative plebiscite to ascertain whether the people wished to move to a republic. If there was a yes vote, it would then go to a joint parliamentary committee and then, of course, it would go to a referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This people's constitutional convention will give a certain amount of ownership to the rest of the Australian community. I think it would be very unwise if we were to go straight to a plebiscite because the level of knowledge is so scant on this subject. We are dealing with an immensely important area. Whilst it might not put another meal on our table, fundamental changes to our constitution, particularly in relation to our head of state and the reserve powers that that person would have, are critical to the democracy of this country. There is certainly no suggestion&mdash;and I would not like to see it at all&mdash;that the Westminster system should be changed. It has proved to be a very viable and a very safe system not just in this country but in many other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP's original plan was to have less people participation. If you go directly to a plebiscite, I would suggest you would get a less informed decision. Indeed, when the details of the people's convention were first put forward by the Prime Minister, it was interesting to note an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. These are the comments that it made about the Australian Labor Party's initial policy advance on moving Australia towards a referendum on the republic:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if we agreed with the ALP's proposition that a plebiscite be held as soon as possible, then we would be supporting a limitation of the debate. For paradoxically (considering Opposition Leader Kim Beazley's view that the Constitution is owned by the people, not the politicians) the ALP would then have the debate channelled through a joint parliamentary committee which would report to Parliament on the particular form of questions which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3500"> should be ultimately put to the people. We believe a broader forum is required to attract and refine the public view. Those who fear minority&hyphen;driven change should recognise the power of the Constitution which means that any proposed change needs majority support of States.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to say there that the holding of the constitutional convention has merit because it will encourage this debate. Certainly, that was the input that I received from the public meetings that I had in the electorate of Richmond. There is certainly a lack of knowledge not just about this process but about our constitution. Perhaps this whole process that we are going through&mdash;firstly, the election of 76 of the 152 which will be from the public&mdash;will start to generate interest. That will then flow through to the 10-day convention which will be held in December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A myth that has been brought about by a number of members of the opposition is that somehow a non-compulsory secret ballot paper will have less impact on the community and that somehow it will be a disenfranchisement for democracy. Another interesting point that was raised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on March 27&mdash;and this was written by Malcolm MacKerras, who is not known for being backward in his views&mdash;was:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The essential point to understand is that each elector will receive a ballot paper in the post accompanied by all other necessary information. With two or three weeks available for voting the elector will have no difficulty understanding the system, which is voter&hyphen;friendly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">After voting has been completed the counting will take about three weeks.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One of the benefits of having a postal vote is that it does allow people to sit down and diagnose the information at their own leisure rather than going directly to a public ballot-box. As the opposition is articulating, if it were compulsory, I would suggest that there would be less scrutiny of the issues. Unfortunately, on many occasions, particularly in general elections, there is a high cynicism displayed by swinging voters. So, by having a ballot process, by receiving information a number of weeks beforehand, people will be able to make an informed decision and an informed choice of who they wish to elect to the constitutional convention.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other interesting points that was raised was that having a secret ballot would somehow lead to manipulation or the government choosing to stack the convention. As most commentators and readers would be aware, there is a wide disparity of views, certainly within the Liberal Party, between pro-monarchists and those proposing the republican system. Indeed, there is even some division within the National Party. Thus, one of the arguments that some of our opponents are using is that if we do have a secret ballot it can be manipulated. It is interesting to note that people like Malcolm Turnbull in an article written by Michael Gordon in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 13 February say that, if this is the case, the ultimate beneficiaries, if we were to read public opinions, would be the republicans. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 13 February states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Republicans are far more likely to participate in the Federal Government's People's Convention, according to a survey that also shows a dramatic drop in opposition to Australia becoming a republic.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister has fulfilled his commitment by going to a people's constitutional convention. Ironically, during that period&mdash;most people recognised the Prime Minister's position&mdash;there was an increase in support for the republic. So one could argue that this particular system would actually favour them, which in many ways negates a lot of the points raised by the opposition this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to actually look at the convention. I have talked about the 76 of the 152 delegates who are to be elected. This will be broken down on a state by state basis: 20 from New South Wales, 16 from Victoria, 13 from Queensland, nine from Western Australia, eight from South Australia, six from Tasmania and two from the territories. This replicates the representation in the House of Representatives. I think that is a prudent representation, and that will then go on to a Senate style ticket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other 76 who will be appointed in the next couple of months, assuming legislation passes through the Senate, will be made up of 40 parliamentary delegates, 20 of these delegates coming from the state and territory parliaments, and the Premier, the Leader of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3501"> the Opposition and a third parliamentary nominee of the Premier will be invited from each state. It is also interesting to note that there is a wide diversity of views amongst the Premiers and amongst the conservative states as to whether Australia should move to change our head of state or whether we should maintain the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other 20 will be Commonwealth parliamentary representatives, and, not unreasonably, they will take the shape of the parliament we are in today: 12 from the government, six from the opposition, one from the Democrats and one Independent. These numbers broadly reflect the representation of parties in the parliament. To suggest that somehow we are manipulating the system, these people represent their constituents; they were publicly elected anyway. So there is a pressure valve in the whole election process of those 152 delegates&mdash;half appointed by the government, or 40 parliamentary elected delegates, and the other 76 from the public at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be 36 non-parliamentary delegates so that those people who do not have an opportunity&mdash;whether it be because of their finances, their disadvantaged position or their age, and that will include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders&mdash;will be able to be appointed to this constitutional forum. There will be a commitment to local government, which was not recognised in our constitution by our forefathers, and at least 10 per cent of government appointees to the convention will be young people between the ages of 18 and 25.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without those safeguards, without that provision, then you probably would not have representation from that group of Australians who will be tomorrow's leaders. For that reason, the actual breakdown of people that will be appointed and also elected to the constitutional convention, in my opinion, is very fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument of having a voluntary ballot paper is also very fair. Why should people be punished, be fined, for not wishing to participate in this process? The government has embarked upon a number of bites of the cherry to inform the public and make them 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> part of the process. First of all, the public will have a choice of those, in my case, 20 delegates from New South Wales or, in Mr Jull's case, 13 delegates from Queensland. You will have a say there; you will be informed. Then it will go to the convention in December where there will be an enormous amount of discussion, which will probably come in the silly season where news items are of less currency. So this will get a fair hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go directly to a plebiscite, as was the ALP's original proposal, I do not believe the Australian public would get a fair hearing. In the government's process we would move to an indicative plebiscite after the constitutional convention and then move to a referendum, where there would be far more information and a far more informed vote by the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regarding postal votes, there is some suggestion that there could be manipulation or fraud. We are not talking about telecommunication unions or other members of the trade union movement who are quite akin to manipulating postal votes. We are talking about a very secure system which the AEC would be policing, whereby ballot papers would be sent out. These will be coded and envelopes will be placed inside those general mail-outs which will also be coded to ensure that there is no duplication or fraud, a particularly important point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a suggestion that the voting system, which has been highlighted by previous speakers, can be further manipulated because a number of people will be disenfranchised, particularly people who have a non-English speaking background. This will be very different to election times. The AEC will have phone lines and interpreter services where you can ring and they will explain the ballot to you. To my understanding, when there is a general election, if you go into a ballot booth you do not have these interpreter services there. Certainly they are written down, but this way you will have three weeks to consider your vote and you will be able to access this AEC procedure. There will be a national hotline right across Australia. If these new immigrants choose to be part of the process, they will be encapsulated in this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3502"> process and I believe they will be given a fairer hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day if you make voting compulsory, many people may not give an informed vote. The most important vote to be given on this issue is if it gets to a referendum. That is where people must have an informed decision on whether or not we change our head of state. This process that we are going through now is a lengthy process and a better process than what Paul Keating or even the Leader of the Opposition have articulated. It will give greater ownership to Australians and to Australian electors than what the previous government had planned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. I think this is particularly important because what we are proposing is a far more democratic process than what the ALP initially wanted, which was to rush to a plebiscite. It would then go off to a joint parliamentary committee. How much ownership and democracy would there be in that decision? In our proposal at least 76 people will be elected outside of the political process. They will not be members of federal parliament or state parliament. Yes, they will encapsulate people from local government. Also, if you have a strong desire, whether you are in the ARM movement or Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, you can be a part of that process. Those people should be part of the process because they have been very articulate and very passionate about it. The ALP's original proposal was that it be hived off to a joint parliamentary committee. That is undemocratic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support and commend the process that the government is putting forward in this bill. It has taken a lot of finessing by Nick Minchin, and I congratulate him for that. I also congratulate the Prime Minister for having the courage to follow through on this convention, notwithstanding that there are many within the Liberal Party who would probably prefer not to have this process. We are being democratic. I have held a number of conventions in my own electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is terribly important here is that more information has to be fed out to the mums and dads and the next voting generation of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia. They have to be better briefed on Australia's constitution. Massive implications would result if we did change our head of state. The next issues that we would address are how we codify that position, how we elect that person and what type of model we have in that person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a younger Australian, I am in favour of looking at changing Australia's head of state, although I am less convinced that the minimalist approach&mdash;or certainly the models that have been produced so far&mdash;will deliver that type of certainty and that type of security for Australia as it moves into the 21st century that we have enjoyed in the 100 years since Federation. It is up to them to demonstrate to the Australian public why we should change a system that has been quite adequate to date. But I, like all other Australians, will enjoy listening and maybe being part of that constitutional convention which will happen for 10 days in December 1997.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The premise of this constitutional convention is that it is designed to enable the Australian community to express a view about the manner and mechanism that may be thought appropriate to move towards a new constitutional framework. But the truth is that it is a process made in order to avoid an outcome. There is no doubt that this is a system that has been set up to fail. You would not devise a process less able to be implemented had you gone about this process with the intellect of a gnat, with the greatest of respect to the lower orders of insects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very silly piece of legislation if it is intended to do what the government says it is intending to do&mdash;that is, to seek the views of the community and to find a forum for their expression. It could only be designed in this way if it was intended to fail. Why would the government put forward a proposition intending it to fail? The reason it is doing so is that the leadership of the government is not committed to a republic. It is not committed to an outcome that it knows the great majority of Australians support, but it is frightened to say that. It is frightened to clarify its position with respect to the way in which Australia should shape its constitutional future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3503">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best way to prevent Australians expressing their will is to set up a forum and a process which are bound to create discord and certain to produce an equivocal outcome. The only outcome that can emerge from this convention, unless it is amended in the manner suggested by the opposition, is a deeply flawed process, participation at abysmally low levels, and a sense in the community that the outcome was tarnished from the start because many of the delegates came from conservative parties in numbers which were quite unrepresentative in relation to their participation in the political process&mdash;in other words, stack the process so that whatever the popular vote a group of laggards will stand outside the republican process who can be counted on to say, `We can't possibly get a consensus.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not speaking of fantasy. Many prominent members of the coalition have already started to articulate the fact that even if 65 per cent of the popular vote is in favour of a republic, by the nature of the nomination and appointment process this government has set in place&mdash;that is, electing delegates to the convention who are not in favour of a republic&mdash;we are certain to get a convention where it could not be said there was near unanimity or anything that represents consensus. In setting up a process which will work only if there is consensus and then devising a mechanism which denies legitimacy and ensures there will be no consensus at the end of the day, a structural failure is being built in from day one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some key deficiencies in the elements of this legislation. The first of those deficiencies is that, against the pattern of Australian participatory democracy, there is to be a voluntary postal ballot. The experience in other countries of voluntary voting systems is that participation is low. In our country, when ballots of this nature have been held at the local government level and within the trade union movement, participation rates have ranged from the abysmal to the merely ordinary. This system could never rival the mandate that comes with popular elections held under our normal democratic system, where all Australians participate through a secret ballot managed by the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Electoral Commission and in which all Australians have a responsibility, by nature of their citizenship, to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we will have instead is a process which is built around an intention to get a low turnout so that those who are putting forward this process can point to that low turnout and have the first black mark to discredit whatever popular vote emerges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next, the voting system will be inexplicable to many Australians. The voting system is not one that anyone will be used to. It is said the electoral system is one that people who fill in Tattslotto forms or punters will have some familiarity with, but it is certainly not one that citizens of this country have ever had any familiarity with in the voting system. So the ballot paper will be confusing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ballot paper will also be provided to electors only in English and only through the post. That is the starting point for two things: massive electoral fraud and the disenfranchisement, in practice, of many millions of Australians. Let us not focus explicitly on those whose first language is other than English. Let us talk about people who are sometimes embraced within what is wrongly called the Australian mainstream&mdash;wrongly because to talk of the Australian mainstream suggests that there are Australian citizens who are not legitimately part of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that includes the blind, how do they participate? If that includes people who have difficulty with literacy&mdash;unfortunately, still a substantial number of the adult population have difficulties with literacy&mdash;how does that affect them? Then there are the people who have changed address. The Australian Electoral Commission estimates that between two million and three million Australians change address between elections. There is no process here to ensure the electoral roll is up to date. Instead of what would be the case in a normal election, where people would know that there was to be a ballot on a particular day and go to a polling station to cast their vote, letters will be sent to people at their old electoral address. There will be no habitation update, so any Australian who has changed address is likely not to receive their ballot paper.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3504">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are those Australians who are overseas. If they happen to be overseas on the day, in a normal election there would be many processes to enable their participation. In this case there will not be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are the people who live, for example, in isolated and remote communities, particularly Aboriginal people but also many non-Aboriginal Australians, who generally benefit from mobile polling booths. How are people who are normally serviced by mobile polling booths and who have habitation registration in community settlements in the bush going to participate effectively? They are normally serviced directly as part of the democratic system, at some cost, but under this system they are simply excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do we deal with the possibility of extremist minority elements seizing hold of this process, knowing that it is going to be a voluntary ballot and seeking to play a part in the process in a way which is quite unrepresentative with respect to their numbers? With the emergence of the Pauline Hanson factor, I do not think that this government really ought to countenance the prospect that this would be a referendum not on what should be the future form of government in this country but which would be the first test of the electoral mandate of a Pauline Hanson One Nation party; yet that is the kind of possibility that is emerging in a ballot which, by its nature, will not be an inclusive one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will not, for example, be easily used by people whose languages are other than English. It will certainly not be used easily by people who are resident in nursing homes. The chances of fraud are massive. It is the case, of course, that there are opportunities for abuse whenever these postal ballot type elections are held. There have been instances in the past in the trade union movement where allegations of fraud have been made in relation to the way in which certain ballots of this nature have been conducted. I suppose a postal ballot of members is the best arrangement that you can come up with, because members are scattered around the country. You cannot have normal compulsory voting for people in those circumstances.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the potential for fraud is there and from time to time, it has been alleged, improprieties have occurred in those elections. Sending millions of letters out in the post&mdash;sometimes to group addresses like nursing homes, but certainly up and down the street&mdash;when the only security that is built into the system is that you have to put your date of birth on the return, is a recipe for rorting. You can well imagine people simply following the postman, picking these letters out of the boxes, getting the names, identifying the dates of birth, filling the forms in and sending them off en masse. What is to prevent it? Certainly there will be penalties if detected, but the Electoral Commission has said that there is no identifiable way of dealing with such fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you set up a process which most Australians will be sceptical about, because it will have low participation. You expose it to the possibility of massive fraud. You create the climate for people to participate not on the basis of the ostensible objective of the convention but in order to test their political muscle. You do it in an unfamiliar way with a balloting system which has never been used before, which is likely to lead to massive informality of votes. And you do it in a circumstance where, whatever the outcome of the election process, the appointed people who come to contribute an equal share will be dominated by a political stack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We thought the best way to deal with the question of Australia's constitutional future was to ask the Australian people straight up, `Are you in favour of Australia becoming a republic&mdash;moving to a republican form of government?' It is not a particularly difficult question and it is a question that all Australians could answer without complexity. Instead of that, what we are being asked to do under this legislation is to endorse a process which is bound to produce a muddled, inconclusive and essentially illegitimate outcome&mdash;an outcome that is guaranteed to produce a flawed and deeply divisive result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have moved a number of amendments which are designed to improve this, to at least get it to a stage where you cannot expect failure or demand failure by the process. It is still not the best process, but at least if we are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3505"> going to have a convention with half the members elected and half the members appointed let us do it in a way which has at least a chance of some success, of actually getting a constructive outcome. So let us have a ballot in which all Australians participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talk about Australians having rights, but they also have responsibilities. Some members on the other side have been talking up about the virtues of voluntary voting. I heard comments along the lines that, if you have no interest in this, it is undemocratic to insist that people participate in the democratic voting process. I think one of the things Australians should be proud of is the fact that, as well as having rights, we as citizens have responsibilities. When you take citizenship in this country, you do not just become a person who puts their hand out and asks for things to be given. You also have a responsibility to participate in the choice of your elected representatives and the form of your government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What could be more fundamental in terms of Australians and their future than the constitutional form that will take us into the next century? If it is important that all Australians participate in national elections, it is important that they participate in an election which will determine the form of government for the future. I am deeply cynical and extremely concerned about people who talk about&mdash;as if it is a good thing&mdash;those who are said to have no interest in a particular ballot not participating, as is their democratic right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That way leads us to the American model, where at the last presidential elections a minority of Americans participated in the election of their national head of state&mdash;the most powerful elected position in the world&mdash;where many of the most significant elections exclude people who are effectively disenfranchised by a whole variety of means from the democratic processes, and where politics becomes an exercise in spending huge amounts of money not on dealing with the questions of what are the correct policies to follow and which party has better credentials to govern but simply on how you can get those voters out and how you can stimulate people to have sufficient interest in the elec 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> toral process to vote. We do not suffer from that. We have a Commonwealth government where the government can claim the strength and support from an elected system in which all Australians participate and give legitimacy to our democratic system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our democratic system is not held too robustly in the eyes of many. There are quite a few people who look upon us with some concern and suggest that we are losing the respect of the community at large. The way we will lose that respect and credibility and continue that process in which we are not held in good regard by the Australian community is to put up dodgy proposals like this, where the will of the people is in a sense being betrayed irrespective of whatever outcome they proceed to express by way of their vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The elected delegates ought to represent the whole Australian community. The balloting system should be fair. When it comes to appointed delegates, there should not be a political stack. There should not be a situation in which, because of the temporary political majority that exists in this Commonwealth and the various states, there is a disproportionate representation of one political party over the others. That is what we are facing now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also facing a process in which this government has not set up an objective process for the selection of those non-elected members who are to be appointed. There is no fairness, no transparency and no democracy in this system. It is designed to fail. It is designed to satisfy John Howard's objective: to delay the Australian people expressing an opinion on that fundamental question, which we all wish to have resolved shortly, as to the future form of our democratic processes and whether we should have an Australian as a head of state. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to speak fairly briefly on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997. It of course enacts another election commitment of the coalition and gives the power to the people of Australia to decide the destiny of our great nation. It enables Australians to elect representatives to debate our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3506"> constitution and whether it should change and, if so, how it should change. It takes the power from the politicians and gives it to the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be remembered that this bill is not about whether Australia should remain a constitutional monarchy or become a republic, although I am sure that that will be made an issue in this debate. It already has been made an issue. This bill is about giving the power to the people to determine our future by choosing their representatives to debate our constitution and, in particular, our head of state. It does not leave it in the hands of a few politicians and backroom party hacks, as was the case under the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the election of the Howard government, we had a Prime Minister intent on imposing his will on the populace. He decided that he wanted Australia to become a republic, so he chose to pursue that goal, no matter what. The problem with that is that, when the people are not consulted, it inhibits the chances of achieving the intended goal at a referendum and only wastes the taxpayers' money. And that is the position that the previous Prime Minister risked by foisting on the people his intended agenda and not the agenda the people wanted. It was that sort of arrogance that showed how the Prime Minister and the Australian Labor Party had lost touch with the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill establishes the framework for the election of delegates to the constitutional convention, which will debate our nation's constitutional future. I am delighted to support this bill&mdash;with a couple of minor reservations, which I will deal with later. There has been great debate over recent years about whether our nation should become a republic and at what time we should become one if we do. Some people have said that it is imperative that the Olympic Games in 2000 be opened by an Australian and that the new millennium is an appropriate time to become a republic. I do not think that that is the issue; indeed, I think it takes the debate away from the real issue of whether our nation remains a constitutional monarchy or becomes a republic, and why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The convention is scheduled for December this year. Prior to that, there will be an elec 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion conducted to elect delegates to the convention, which is what this legislation enacts. I note the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy and the Australian Republican Movement have launched their campaigns to elect delegates. I welcome the diverse opinion that will be a feature of the convention and trust it will prove to be not only a robust debate but, more importantly, a firm statement on what direction our nation's constitution should take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One very attractive feature of this bill, which I welcome, is the provision of voluntary voting. I support the concept of voluntary voting and do not believe people should be compelled to vote if they do not wish to. It is anathema to the freedom of the individual and an obstruction to proper democracy that they should be forced to vote. I think that a voluntary vote for the election of convention delegates would be a good precursor for the introduction of voluntary voting in federal elections. It will show that, even with voluntary voting, Australians will take an interest in our nation's democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that members of the Labor Party and in particular the Australian Democrats, who would never win a place in parliament if it were not for compulsory voting, do not support voluntary voting. But, in this instance, the vote for delegates need not be compulsory because the constitutional convention will not be the final say on our constitution. It will only make recommendations. I hope those parties do not delay the debate by moving all sorts of ridiculous amendments to make the vote compulsory. Those who are interested in this issue will vote on it; those who do not care or are not interested should not be forced to vote on it. Nevertheless, the final say would be with the Australian population at a referendum for which, of course, voting would still be compulsory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also welcome the concept of conducting the election via a postal ballot. Recently, in Western Australia, council elections were held and a number of councils had postal ballots for the election of councillors. The end result was an increased participation in the democratic process in those areas which provided postal ballots. Postal ballots are also cheaper 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3507"> to conduct than the traditional ballot box poll. I think it allows electors to choose their preference freely without being attacked by people handing out how&hyphen;to&hyphen;vote cards which waste far too much paper anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that there have been some protests about the nomination fee and the fact that there is not a minimum number of female delegates prescribed. I think a $500 fee is suitable, given the enormity of the task that the delegates are putting their name forward for. To make it cheaper would be to invite the typical mischievous candidate who puts their name forward not because of a commitment to the task ahead but as a cheap publicity stunt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of representation of women, I oppose any form of quotas. The fact is that there could be more females elected than males. It depends on how many nominate, of course. But if quotas are imposed it again impedes democracy. There should not be quotas for men or women. It should be up to the people to choose who the delegates are. I would hope their decision is based not on the sex of the candidate but on their qualities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My only concern with this convention, which I have made known to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), is the disproportionate representation of the states. I would rather the representation be similar to Senate representation, where the states have an equal footing. As it is, New South Wales has 20 delegates, Victoria 16, Queensland 13, Western Australia nine, South Australia eight, Tasmania six and the territories two each. This convention has enormous implications for the future of our nation and should therefore be seen to be equal and fair in its deliberations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good&mdash;flick `em out. I fear that providing majority representation to the more populous states will place greater attention on the membership and biases of the major states and ignore the real issue of the future of our nation's constitution. The Senate has equal representation for the protection of the less populous states. This is an issue where the less populous states deserve, and should be provided with, a voice equal to the more populous states. I fear that failure to provide this could compromise the convention. I accept that this will not be changed. I only hope that this does not prohibit the will of the majority of Australians being heard and that the imbalance in state representation does not prohibit the opportunity for our nation to take the course of action the majority of Australians wish for simply because this will be used as a reason to oppose any proposed changes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party's position on an Australian republic is well known to all in this chamber and to the community generally. At the last election we campaigned on a commitment to achieve an Australian republic by the year 2000. What a magnificent opportunity there is when we are displaying ourselves as a nation in the course of what will be a marvellous Olympic Games&mdash;and the world will be coming here&mdash;to show a vibrant, independent minded, commercially effective Australia with great sporting and cultural achievements, and to have that opportunity launched by an Australian head of state. That was the objective, the symbolism that would be associated with that. As we enter into a new millennium we enter it as a proudly independent nation with our own head of state, our own constitutional arrangements. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3508">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always taken that position in full knowledge that the constitutional arrangements which served Australia at our creation were constitutional arrangements associated with a great democracy, that of the United Kingdom, with great parliamentary traditions, great civil libertarian traditions, and great democratic traditions. We do not spurn them; we relish them, we value them, and we are concerned about threats to some aspects of them that are contained within this bill. But our position on the republic is not a statement of our views about the United Kingdom or about our origins. We are proud of our origins and we are proud of the sources of the democracy that we have here in this country. We are made even prouder when we see magnificent results like that which were seen recently in the United Kingdom with an overwhelming vote for the Labour Party. I congratulate Tony Blair on his victory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nor is our approach in any shape or form a rejection of the current Queen of Australia. This woman has been a magnificent monarch; there is no question about that. She has, for those of you who have met her, an encyclopaedic knowledge of the affairs of this country and indeed of the whole Commonwealth. We look forward to an Australian republic within that Commonwealth in which she is the head. We have absolutely no problems with that set of arrangements at all, nor any adverse commentary on any aspect of her reign nor any adverse commentary on her involvement with and commitment to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a debate about the royal family, nor is it a debate about Britain; it is about Australia, the sort of nation we are, what we stand for, who most effectively represents us. That is the source of the position we have taken on the creation of an Australian republic. We do not think it is a terribly difficult thing to do, either. One of the most interesting things, if you take that schoolboy debating trait, which people do from time to time, and pick up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford Dictionary</EMPHASIS> you will see in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford Dictionary</EMPHASIS> and that the term `Commonwealth' is interchangeable with the term `republic'. A republic is a Commonwealth. What is a Commonwealth?&mdash;a repub 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lic. You will find that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford Dictionary</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We already have the correct title for the Australian republic. We do not actually need to make any changes as far as that is concerned. Perhaps we see something of an answer in that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford Dictionary</EMPHASIS> to what was reputed to be Queen Victoria's concern and distaste for that when the original Constitution of Australia was framed the delegates at that constitution chose the word `Commonwealth', which was either in her mind associated with the republic, or with Oliver Cromwell. From her point of view neither were terribly acceptable associations. Nevertheless, our delegates at that time progressed the title of Australia to a republican title but did not progress our constitutional forms to the same position. That is left to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it ought to be about&mdash;this whole process by which we go about creating that final stage of formal structural independence of the Australian nation&mdash;is a vibrant debate in our own community, a discussion on one side as to whether or not this is a constitutional change whose time has not yet come and that they like the old forms and want to be in it&mdash;that is a perfectly legitimate position to express and ought to be expressed in the course of a debate in a referendum associated with such constitutional change&mdash;and on the other by those in our community who feel proud of where we have got to, believe the constitution can and ought to move on and that they ought to have an opportunity to express their point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate could be a unifying experience for the Australian community, an experience whereby they set aside their normal partisan commitments, their normal concerns with the political parties&mdash;indeed, maybe their hostilities with all forms of politics&mdash;and make a statement about themselves as a people and themselves as a nation. Either way, make that statement. That is why it is such a disappointment to find what ought to be an easy progress, via plebiscite and referendum to a final conclusion one way or another on this particular matter, is put like a limpet, if you like, to suck blood from this particular debate. What has been put in place for this constitu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3509"> tional convention has been done in such a way as to raise many questions about itself, as to be reasonably seen as a blocking mechanism by those who would deprive the Australian people of a meaningful debate, who would seek to bore them, who would seek to put in place a set of arrangements which confuses their assessments of what ought to be a fairly simple process&mdash;decision yea or nay&mdash;on this particular proposition, and to cause them to say, as they so often do, unfortunately, in this country, `It's just the politicians playing games again.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us recollect where this particular convention came from. It did not come from a position inside the Liberal Party which said that this is the best way to go about this process. Indeed, as it has exited the last polls and been contemplated within the halls of government over the course of the last 12 months, I am as aware as anyone else that there has been a deal of backing and filling in this government as to whether or not they ought to proceed with a convention. That is perhaps because this leader of the Liberal Party, the Prime Minister, recognised the political fix that was associated with it for his predecessor as leader of the Liberal Party as he desperately tried to control an issue that was getting out of control inside his ranks at that time&mdash;a pretty ignoble and expensive fix, as far as the Australian taxpayer is concerned, and a fix which is worse than simply that and in fact sullies what ought to be an interesting and pure debate, a relationship between us as a parliament and the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not writing on a clean sheet of paper, as the delegates did back in the 1890s. Our founding fathers and mothers, for good or ill, set up a process by which the constitution was changed. The process by which the constitution was changed clearly establishes a direct relationship between parliament and the people. That is the process by which ultimately it will have to be changed. This particular proposition merely is interference along the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are entitled to scrutinise this not as an essential mechanism for the task at hand. Other mechanisms can be pursued and ultimately will have to be pursued by this parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment in relation to a consultation with the Australian people on their wishes as to whether we ought to become a republic. It is, therefore, an object that can be viewed within the context of what it does to the debate overall and what it does to the quality of Australian politics. The answer to what it does to the quality of Australian politics is: not much good at all. Indeed, potentially, it does a deal of damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go to the first issue which was raised by the person who spoke before me, the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), the question of voluntary voting. There is a suggestion here that this voluntary voting issue, in this particular context, in no way foreshadows an ultimate intention by the government. Of course it does. The previous speaker made that amply clear. The previous speaker on the Liberal side said that he was overjoyed by the prospect that there would be voluntary voting associated with this because he believed in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know the consequences of, if you like, voluntary attendance at the poll, because there is not compulsory voting in Australia but compulsory attendance at the poll. You do not have to vote; you attend the poll. But, for shorthand, people talk about voluntary and compulsory voting. All you have to do, in looking at the consequences of voluntary voting associated with this and encouraging that attitude to develop in the community, is consider the unrepresentative nature of American politics, as it has now become, whereby the President of the United States effectively emerges with a mandate of about 15 to 20 per cent of the American people. If you think that the discrediting of politics has proceeded apace over the last few years or so in Australia and that a large percentage of Australians have turned off the political process, try the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the citizen militias operating around the United States now, the fact that they feel totally disconnected from politics, that the political representatives do not represent the totality of the people of the nation, means that they feel that they can opt out of the nation in some sort of confederated anarchy. Their followers in this country, of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3510"> course, describe themselves as the Confederate Action Party. That is not because they are overjoyed at General Robert E. Lee and the folks who tried to revolt against the United States back in 1860; it is a description of the nature of the internal political process that they seek, essentially the dissolution of the nation. So the voluntary voting aspect of this is a bad precedent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process by which it is taking place offends me even more&mdash;it may not necessarily offend all my party even more than the voluntary process, but it offends me even more than the voluntary process&mdash;and that is the postal ballot that is associated with this. There is one thing on which everybody in this chamber&mdash;Liberal, National Party, Independent and Labor&mdash;can stand proud in the international sphere, and that is on the fact that we in this country have come to epitomise corruption&hyphen;free politics in the balloting process. The secret ballot is known globally as `the Australian ballot'. It is the Australian ballot that has come to mark the peculiar contribution of the Australian nation to the democratic process internationally. That reputation has stood us in enormous good stead over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our politicians, our electoral officials and our public servants are eagerly sought internationally when a country becomes a democracy, as many have over the last 20 years or so. Our advice is eagerly sought, our participation is eagerly sought and our witness to the political process is eagerly sought. Why? Because back there at the turn of this century we defined the nature of the Australian people and the Australian nation by the corruption&hyphen;free aspect of that ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going to happen with this is several&hyphen;fold difficulties. The first problem involved here is that up to three million Australians may well not receive a ballot paper because they will have shifted address since the last election. The second feature is that the material on the ballot will be available in writing and only in English. Unlike the polling booth process, whereby you can get assistance to vote, this is going to disenfranchise the blind, the frail or aged, the illiterate or people whose English skills are not of sufficiently high standard to be able to read what is going to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be an inordinately complex ballot paper when it finally hits the table. There will be hundreds of candidates, extraordinarily difficult directions and an extraordinarily convoluted process which they have to follow to fill it out, covering material, including their date of birth, and all the rest of it. A whole series of difficult processes will have to be gone through to cast a formal ballot. Instead of the ease of assistance at the polling booth, you are going to get confusion, fear and worry as this lands on the kitchen table of the average Australian citizen as this ballot proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Add to that the lack of secrecy. People are going to seek legitimate assistance; others are going to attempt to interfere. There will always be the need for legitimate assistance for that ballot paper to be properly concluded. Instead of a polling booth in which people's votes are cast in secret, we are going to have a kitchen table vote to which your neighbours can be witness, to which your friends can be witness, to which your enemies, if they can put enough pressure on you, can be witness. The whole point of the secret ballot process was to take that pressure out of politics, that corruption out of politics. This postal ballot puts it right back in. The fact that that great Australian tradition of the secret ballot has been so vehemently compromised by this process is an absolute tragedy in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, instead of having that vote cast in about five minutes flat when you are in the polling booth, these ballot papers are going to be lying about on people's tables for something like six weeks. This is going to compound the problems that are going to emerge with the difficulties that will be experienced from people having changed their address, the fact that large numbers are not enrolled and the fact that 200,000 people overseas will be effectively disenfranchised by this process but would not have been by another process. The time between close of nominations and close of rolls is going to be one week. So a whole lot of youngsters in Australia are going to be cut out of an opportunity to cast a ballot in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even when they express a view, it is a minority who will return ballot papers. Sadly, we do have this sort of process associated 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3511"> with the voluntary ballot in Western Australia in local government. One could say perhaps that at that level of government you can live with it. At the local government level you get about a 20 to 30 per cent return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are going to get from this process is its discrediting. Whatever the outcome is from this particular process, it will be capable of being discredited. People will be able to say, `It did not represent majority opinion' or `It was flawed because large numbers of ballot papers were not returned' or `It was flawed because we have got evidence that Aunt Maude turned up the day we all cast the vote, put the weights on us and&mdash;for fear of loss of our inheritance&mdash;we were in trouble if we did not cast our vote a particular way,' and so on. As well as that discrediting process, you are going to get the discrediting process that is associated with the fact that people will not be able to get themselves into a position to vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another problem associated with this legislation, and that goes to the way that parliamentary delegates are drawn. The effort here is not to create partisan advantage&mdash;that has been the position on both sides of this chamber for some considerable period, including when we were in government&mdash;but to create an opportunity for the whole nation to express itself. Yet the parliamentary representation is a parliamentary advantage for government, at both levels of operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had constitutional conventions before when it has been a fifty&hyphen;fifty proposition. That has been done with the Liberal Party in government and it has been done with us in government. When Mr Keating talked about using a parliamentary committee for this process, he did not take advantage of the fact that we happened to be in government&mdash;and anticipated staying there&mdash;to say that there would be a majority in favour of the Labor Party. What he said was that it would be even Steven on that parliamentary committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot help feeling that an effort is being made here to further rig and discredit the process&mdash;on top of all the rigging and discrediting that goes on in association with the way in which the ballot will be con 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ducted&mdash;that there is a rigging going on here to produce an outcome in one particular direction. Those on the other side of the House who oppose the notion of going to a republic&mdash;there are many who support the notion&mdash;are going around the corridors and talking to each other. They are saying to worried National Party members and worried monarchists from other parts of their organisations, `Don't worry, boys, we have really got this one discredited if we need to have it discredited. We are not going to have majority votes. We are in there stacking it for all we are worth in the way in which we are going to have the partisan appointments from parliamentarians to it. We are going to get into a situation where it will be such a muddle by the end of the day that we will be able to say that the whole republican process is compromised and flawed. Let's leave it and think about it a century or so from now. Let's not worry about it proceeding.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the House do not want this process at all. If we are going to have this process, we do not want a flawed variant of this process such as the one we have before us at the moment. We want the Australian people to have a vote on the issue itself&mdash;not for the beauty parade that will be placed before them by a whole lot of eccentric opinions as well as valid opinions, which is what we are going to get over the next couple of months, with the extremists and the zealots looking upon this as an opportunity to do this country some damage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The convention for which the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill legislates is a vital part of a process for coming to a conclusion about whether or not Australia should become a republic and, if so, what sort of republic and when. It meets absolutely the commitments made by the coalition to the Australian people before the 1996 election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The path that led to this bill was shaped by the push and pull of political forces&mdash;there is no escaping that. But the process which has emerged has substantially transcended partisan politics and gives the Australian people a real chance to get the constitution they want. When Paul Keating mounted his campaign to achieve a republic he unleashed forces that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> did outlive his prime ministership. I think that, in the republic, Mr Keating found an issue in which he deeply believed and one which he thought would divide and damage the coalition. I cannot say whether he recognised fully that if his tactics succeeded they also risked dividing the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the coalition has progressively built an effective consensus on the politics and on the substance of the issue, which is based on our commitment to giving the Australian people the constitution that they want. This is a tribute to a succession of coalition leaders. John Hewson, despite the fragility of his leadership following the 1993 election loss, overcame what must have been a strong impulse to simply deny that there was even any need to discuss the issue and declared that the coalition would engage in the debate and would consider whether or not there was a compelling case for becoming a republic. Alexander Downer took the process a step further by proposing a people's centennial convention, the composition of which was essentially the same as the one proposed in this bill, to which a coalition government would refer a broad range of matters for consideration and put to a referendum significant recommendations approved by a broad consensus of the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard confirmed this as Leader of the Opposition and finally blunted the divisiveness and partisanship of the Keating approach. Despite the fact that he is, by his own description, `certainly not Australia's leading republican', and his quite accurate perception that there are and were more pressing matters facing Australia than the debate, he made the opposition's final commitment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a consensus emerges from the people's convention regarding the head of state, that consensus will be promoted by the government at a constitutional referendum. If no consensus emerges, then the Australian people will be asked to vote on a series of options for change to establish which one of them they desire. These options for change will include that of electing the president by direct popular vote as well as by a parliamentary vote as proposed by the Prime Minister . . . Naturally, the option of retaining the present system would be included in any vote. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3513">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Taken together, these commitments provided security that the convention was not an attempt to bury the issue and guaranteed that, at the end of the day, the Australian people would be the ones who decided who their head of state would be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting things off the partisan agenda is one thing: delivering on promises is another. The Prime Minister and the government have delivered on their promises, despite media speculation that they would not do so and despite the imperative urgings of the opposition that the government break its commitment and go immediately to a plebiscite. Those urgings, I am interested to note, have been continued in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am totally committed to a compulsory voting system for federal elections, I do believe that voluntary postal voting for the election of delegates to the convention is acceptable and sensible both because of cost and because the convention will debate and recommend rather than decide the issue of constitutional change. There is this funny thing called the postal vote that goes around in federal elections, which we certainly do not think is constantly being rorted!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision on what comes out of the process will be decided by the people of Australia in a referendum at which voting will be compulsory. The government's commitments and its adherence to them have maximised the possibility of this nation coming to a rational and effective long&hyphen;term solution to the issue of head of state. Despite the substantive and symbolic significance of the republican issue, it is not now a partisan issue amongst the public. The last public survey I saw indicated that it was one of the lowest factors motivating the vote one way or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The low intensity register reflects the fact that Australians, despite their different beliefs and predispositions about the best way to go on constitutional change, believe that the processes that have been put in place will allow the issue to be appropriately and sensibly resolved without becoming a focus for politically partisan division. Equally, anyone who does not know that low intensity issues can quickly heat up if they are mishandled is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not about to win a Nobel Prize for political acumen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There should be no doubt about the potential divisiveness of this issue: it is significant. This is why I believe that the people's convention&mdash;a convention which will in part emerge from the direct election of delegates&mdash;is important and why arguments for abandoning it and going directly to an indicative plebiscite do not serve the cause of a rational debate or a sustainable outcome. I do not say this on the basis of any belief in the inevitability of the convention coming to a consensus. A consensus may be too much to hope for given that there will be strong and organised republican and monarchist factions and that achieving a consensus requires arriving at a general agreement, which is more demanding than getting mere majority support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prospect of a lack of consensus has been anticipated. There are fail&hyphen;safe mechanisms in the form of the government's commitment to an indicative plebiscite and, ultimately, there is the commitment to a referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Above all, the responsibilities of the convention are to expose the issues fully and frankly. The real benefits of the convention, short of its achieving consensus, are to focus the attention of the Australian people, to expose the issues, to explore the consequences on the operation of our political life of taking different courses of action and to deal with what our political system should look like in the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that these issues will be dealt with appropriately nor that the convention will meet its obligations if it reduces the debate to a polarised and unreflective retracing of fixed positions. Both monarchists and republicans should review the set positions they have taken up and address straightforwardly the apparent predispositions of the Australian people. I want to focus briefly on some aspects of these tasks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first relates to the fact that the monarchists cannot overly rest on inertia as a decisive argument for their position. It is common ground that the present constitutional system has served us well since Federation. The real issue is whether this system will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3514"> acceptable to Australians and serve Australia as well in the next century. The old saying, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' does have a certain ring, but its attraction should not be regarded as overwhelming. Constitutional mechanisms do have their limits. Their bearings can wear out. Structures which worked well in the past may not work well in the future. A consensual recognition of a status quo's past success needs to be matched by a degree of foresight and vision about what Australia may need in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Past success is not a guarantee of future effective functioning, and this is certainly the case where one of the key elements that has allowed our system to work so well is the character and commitment of an individual. Queen Elizabeth II has been an essential part of the Australian constitutional mechanism. She has served that constitution superbly. The Australian federation has existed for 96 years. For 45 of those years, Queen Elizabeth II has been our monarch. She has bridged the period in which the British empire, of which Australia was once so proud a part, has been dissolved. She has been the only monarch that an overwhelming majority of the Australian people&mdash;80 per cent, on my estimate&mdash;have ever known. The Queen has been an intrinsic and much admired part of our nation, even in times of intense constitutional conflict. Indeed, although my recollections are a bit fuzzy, I recollect Gough Whitlam saying, in his moment of maximum distress at being dismissed by the Governor&hyphen;General, `The Queen would never have done it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will the constitutional mechanism still bind as effectively, in the absence of the individual who has for so long and for so many Australians been the embodiment of the monarchy? Certainly, many Australians who are committed to the system have indicated that a key reason for their support of the constitutional monarchy is their personal attachment to Queen Elizabeth II and that, without her, they would consider republicanism. The convention, and particularly the monarchist component of it, must address this in an intelligent and dispassionate way. They cannot push the issue aside by saying it can be addressed later. To do this would run a substantial risk 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the system would be put under stress when the time for a succession does come, as inevitably it will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The republicans, for their part, have to abandon the pretence that there would be no change to the system if we were to move to a head of state elected by two&hyphen;thirds of parliament. The minimalist republic is a total myth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Republican Movement and the Republic Advisory Committee have taken the position that a change from a constitutional monarchy with an appointed Governor&hyphen;General to a republic with a president elected by the federal parliament and possessing the powers currently held by the Governor&hyphen;General&mdash;powers which the RAC believes would not have to be codified&mdash;would not have a real impact on the political system. The impact would be substantial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governors&hyphen;General are appointed by the monarch on the advice of a single individual, the Prime Minister of the day. They are unsupported by any direct democratic mandate or parliamentary electoral mandate. Despite this, the reserve powers of the office, those exercised by the Governor&hyphen;General&mdash;not on the advice of government but at the personal discretion of the Governor&hyphen;General&mdash;are formidable. These powers are part of the background against which we play our politics and they profoundly affect the politics of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governors&hyphen;General can, in some circumstances, choose the Prime Minister and they have, on occasion, selected leaders of the minority party. They can dismiss governments on grounds of breaching the constitution. They can refuse to accept the government's advice that the parliament be dissolved. A Governor&hyphen;General can dismiss a Prime Minister who cannot secure supply: that has been proved beyond doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The republicans' proposals would create a presidency combining the powers of the Governor&hyphen;General with an unprecedented degree of parliamentary legitimacy and national authority. Elected by two&hyphen;thirds of the federal parliament, the president would have greater parliamentary endorsement than the Prime Minister, who need only command 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3515"> support of a majority of the House of Representatives. Only four Prime Ministers in Australia's history have achieved a two&hyphen;thirds majority in the parliament and no Prime Minister has had such support since the system of Senate voting was changed in 1949.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This president would personify Australia. He or she would, to use Mr Keating's words `embody and represent Australia's values and traditions, Australia's experience and aspirations'. It should be self&hyphen;evident that the creation of a president with such powers, such parliamentary endorsement and such national authority would substantially change the operation of our political system. The president's views would, of course, find public expression. A new authority and a new influence would be created. This would impact on Australian politics and public policy in new ways. There would be frictions, uncertainties and new accommodations that, over time, would change our system of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This conclusion is reinforced when we consider the experience of other parliamentary republics, which&mdash;the Republic Advisory Committee asserted&mdash;confirms the `feasibility' of a change to an Australian president without significantly altering our political life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The international experience essentially does two things: first, it confirms that republics can deliver good, effective government; second, it confirms that the Republic Advisory Committee's assertions are invalid. I do not have time to go through a detailed analysis of the cases, but the bottom line is that international evidence simply does not support the RAC's assertion that we can have a president, with all the powers accruing to a Governor-General, selected by a two-thirds majority of the parliament and leave our system unaltered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I believe that both republicans and monarchists must address the view registered by the overwhelming majority of Australians&mdash;that, if there is to be a republic, the Australian people want to be the ones who directly elect the president. The direct election of a president is the overwhelming preference of the Australian people. It is supported by over 70 per cent of Australians in all states; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> over 70 per cent of Australians in both city and country; over 70 per cent of Liberal, Labor and minority party voters; over 70 per cent of Australian men; and over 70 per cent of Australian women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that there might be some cynicism amongst the Australian people if monarchists and republicans, whilst being unable to agree on a preferred system, reached a form of negative consensus on this issue. But this cynicism would not really be the issue because, if the convention does not come to a consensus on its preferred alternative, the government is committed to a plebiscite which asks the Australian people to `vote on a series of options for the changes to establish which of them they desire. These options for change will include that of electing a president by direct popular vote . . . '</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that an elected president would change our political system profoundly. It is incumbent on the convention to fully draw out the changes to our political system that such a direct election of a president would bring. If the convention agrees that this is not the way to go, then it will have to put a significant effort into communicating to the Australian people the reason for its views on a directly elected president and convince them that this path should not be pursued. I do not believe that the convention can simply brush these views aside if it does not come to a consensus on the position of a head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the Australian constitution is uniquely the property of the Australian people. Dealing with it is quite different from the normal run of politics in which, essentially, the people delegate powers and elect politicians to discharge their will, and, if they do not like it, they can sanction them at the forthcoming election. Ultimately, the Australian constitution belongs to the Australian people. Only they can and should decide what constitution we should have. I believe that the most effective role for the politicians in this fundamental matter should be to draw out the consequences of change for the Australian people and for the future of Australian politics rather than to seek to impose their own prejudices, preferences and conveniences on the convention process.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3516">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attacks made by the opposition on the convention process&mdash;and they have been fairly sustained&mdash;do not have any legs. I reiterate that postal voting is not anathema to the secret ballot: indeed, it is part of our secret ballot. The fact of a convention rather than a plebiscite should focus attention on, and should provide the basis for, a rational and reasonable outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Australia now has an opportunity to deal with the issue of a head of state in a thoughtful and deliberate way. If we do not grasp this opportunity, the likelihood is that at some future point we will find ourselves in a position where fundamental structural decisions affecting the Australian polity are driven by political momentum, stress and passion. I believe that that would minimise the chance of achieving outcomes which we both intend and desire. The convention will make a significant contribution to this outcome. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As an Independent, I would have to say that it is a great shame that this debate on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill has become so politicised over the past decade, since the push for Australia to become a republic by the centenary of our Federation first gathered steam. It became politicised largely because members of the conservative side of politics in this country found themselves being left behind as the ALP, particularly Paul Keating, championed the cause for Australia having its own head of state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is fair to say that it is an issue that has not galvanised the general electorate&mdash;most of us are more concerned about what we consider to be more important day-to-day issues&mdash;it is fair to say that it is an issue of significant importance to a large body of Australians. So significant is it that, in time, the Liberal and National parties found themselves having to play catch&hyphen;up with the ALP. They realised that this was not an issue that was going to go away and they had to have some sort of credible alternative proposal&mdash;alternative, that is, to Mr Keating's plan to simply let the people of Australia have their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say in an indicative plebiscite. What was wrong with that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Mr Downer, the then opposition leader, put up this idea of holding a constitutional convention. It is a policy the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) inherited, and to his credit he has kept his election promise and we will proceed with the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we have seen the government break quite a few pre&hyphen;election commitments, it is a real pity, in some respects, that it has honoured this one because I am quite sure that the Labor Party's proposal to hold an indicative plebiscite first would have been a preferable way of handling this issue. That way any convention would at least have had a clear&hyphen;cut idea of what the people of Australia wanted in general terms. However, I accept that now we are stuck with holding the convention first, thus putting the cart before the horse. Now that we have it, it should be our priority to ensure we make it work and work fairly. Let us not create a confrontation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are legitimate arguments out there on both sides of the republican and monarchist causes. We should be facilitating a convention that is transparently fair in its make&hyphen;up and does not disguise an attempt to distort the results. I fear there are elements of that in the way this convention&mdash;what at the moment appears to be a Clayton's convention&mdash;is being designed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the interests of promoting the consensus approach I believe is needed as we come together to discuss the constitutional future of this country heading into the next millennium, I support this bill's idea but certainly not its substance. Amendments have been put forward calling for the vote to be made compulsory. I endorse those. Compulsory voting is an honoured tradition in our democracy. It is important because it ensures all Australians have a say on who they want to govern and the task is not just left up to those who are interested or do not have anything better to do on polling day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there are some on the conservative side of politics who would love to do away with compulsory voting because they think it favours the ALP. The same sort of thinking would reject preferential voting in order to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3517"> squeeze out independence. No doubt some are looking forward to this non-compulsory election for the convention as a bit of a trial run, if you like, to see how it goes and to serve their narrow non-democratic cause. That is why this non-compulsory vote is morally wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This constitutional convention is every bit as important, if not more important, than a general election. Our political forefathers thought compulsory voting was important enough to have it safeguarded in the constitution. Now the government want to tamper with that and bring it in the back door without a referendum. As I said, compulsory voting is one of the basic tenets of our unique Australian democracy. It is one of the things that sets our democracy apart from some of the other great democracies around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's plan to make this a non-compulsory vote is heading into very dangerous waters. What if next time around we are having a poll to decide the nation's future the government of the day says, `Let's ignore the constitution. Let's not have women or Aboriginals vote.' I know it sounds ridiculous, but in effect that is what this bill is doing. It is playing around with, or at least challenging, one of basic rules that this democracy has lived by for almost a century. It will be a sad day for Australia if this bill is passed as it stands without the opposition's amendments making voting compulsory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If sections of the Liberal Party really are determined to eventually abolish compulsory voting, then it should have the gumption to put it to the people in a referendum, let them have their say and not try to introduce it through this trial process, this testing of the waters. Here we are about to stage a multi&hyphen;million dollar convention to decide whether to change one aspect of our constitution, while on the other hand another part of the constitution is being dishonoured and thrown out the window.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise it would cost considerably more to make voting compulsory for this convention, as opposed to an expected cost of $36 million for a full election which, by the way, could have included an indicative plebiscite to give the convention delegates a real starting point. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It would cost about $50m according to estimates to stage it as a full general election or as a full poll of everyone in the electorate. What price democracy? What price our future? When we are already investing so much to stage it, is it not worth spending just that little bit more to ensure it is done properly? As the saying goes, a job worth doing is worth doing well. If we do not, we face the real danger of the process being rorted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already the republicans and monarchists are mustering their forces to ensure they can get as many people as possible to vote for their respective candidates. Looking at how politics works in the US, the side that can get around to as many nursing homes and retirement villages as possible and get pensioners to sign away their votes will win at the end of day. Non-compulsory voting in the US has led to marginalisation of unrepresented ordinary folk, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) alluded to in his speech on this bill. Extremism is being cultured by that process and, at $600,000 per congress seat, the US now has the best democracy money can buy. Do we want to head down that path?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real danger is particularly that young people who are not as politically aware and are generally apathetic toward politics will not have their say through this process. That is a great shame because it is their future we are talking about. At the end of day, it will be a real challenge for the republicans and monarchists to stage campaigns that will motivate as many people as possible to cast their votes for their respective sides. I think the non&hyphen;compulsory vote will favour the monarchists, as it would the coalition in a general election. Yet the polls, as in the euthanasia debate, show a different story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you may have already seen on Monday of this week the Monarchist League announced its New South Wales team of candidates for the convention. There are six candidates headed by Brigadier Alf Garland, all very well respected and very experienced people and very committed to their cause, most of them over 50 and not a young person or someone from an ethnic background in sight&mdash;a ticket that really does not typify a multicultural Australia of the late 1990s but 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3518"> perhaps has more in common with Australia when the Queen first visited here in 1954.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the sort of representative ticket we are going to see in this election, then I would be very surprised if Australia's youth are motivated firstly to enrol and then to vote for such unrepresentative candidates. I was rather dismayed to note that one of monarchist candidates was reported as saying this campaign was `even more serious than the fight against Hitler in World War II.' I am not an ardent republican by any means. I think we have far greater problems confronting us in this country, but I would hope that this comment is not indicative of the standard of debate we are about to experience over the coming months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already touched upon the great history of democracy in Australia and we really are fortunate to live in one of the world's most stable and free nations. But, while our British heritage has contributed to that stability, it has been established and safeguarded by the people of this great continent and their respect for commonsense and a fair go. We do not need to wage scare campaigns to discuss this issue. What we do need is sensible, intelligent and constructive debate, much like we saw at the federation conventions of a century ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that one such convention took place in my own electorate. The Bathurst people's convention in 1896 was credited with getting the federation debate back on the boil. There are some remarkable similarities surrounding the federation debate of that time and the current republican push today. The People's Federal Convention was organised by the people of Bathurst frustrated that the push toward federation appeared to be on the backburner. Until that time, the federation debate had been dominated by politicians, particularly the father of federation, Sir Henry Parkes. Sir Henry died that year and the movement suffered because of the loss of a powerful and eloquent champion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While many state colonies supported federation, Queensland&mdash;funnily enough&mdash;remained a major stumbling block. Many in the general population were strongly opposed to federation, believing the time was `inop 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> portune'. Others were ambivalent and more preoccupied with more pressing problems of the day, such as bank collapses and drought. Today it is drought, bank profits and lack of bank services perhaps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Bathurst were determined to get federation back on track and so organised their own people's convention, inviting representatives from all over Australia. Their sole aim was to educate the people on this important question. They insisted it was to be a people's convention based on the people's will, appealing to our sentiment, patriotism and intellect. The editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bathurst Times</EMPHASIS> on the opening day of the convention wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Men of all shades of political thought are united in the one object of endeavouring, by giving expression of intelligent opinion to inform and educate the public mind upon a question, which, up to the present has received but scant consideration.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  recognised the significance of the Bathurst people's convention, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once we get the towns of the colonies to make an enthusiastic move in the matter, it will not be long before the sheer weight of public opinion will make Federation a realisable matter.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That convention succeeded in its goal of taking the federation debate to the people. It resulted in federal legal organisations being formed throughout Australia and was a major catalyst in Australia finally becoming federated in 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the more interesting debates during the convention surrounded the question of how Australia's Governors-General should be appointed. Mr John Norton of Sydney put the cat among the pigeons when he suggested the Governor-General should be voted on by members of parliament instead of being appointed by an absentee monarch. He argued that people in Australia should have the power to elect their own head of state. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely there were at least a score of public men in Australia, who by their long and arduous service, their experience, culture and training were qualified to occupy the highest position that it was possible to confer upon them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Norton said he did not believe there would be the slightest difficulty in obtaining 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3519"> Her Majesty's assent to a bill giving the people of Australia power to elect their own chief ruler. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would be sufficient ingenuity in the Federal Parliament when elected to provide those constitutional safeguards that would guarantee the selection would be a wise one.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Norton felt the appointment of a Governor-General by the Queen would not be democratic, but others argued his motion calling for a parliamentary vote for the Governor-General was `disloyal to the motherland'. He was accused of `inserting the thin edge of republicanism and trying to drive it home'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The convention was taking place just after the US presidential election of that year, and many argued Australia did not want to head down the same path as the USA. They said the US President had too much power and the campaign had disrupted business in the US for four months. `We're far better to have a monarch who reigns but does not govern,' was the argument that won the day, with the Bathurst convention ending with three cheers for the Queen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are again, 100 years later and about to begin another great debate about what role, if any, the English monarch should play in our governance and how our head of state should be elected. I would suggest that Australia's step towards having its own head of state at the beginning of the 21st century is not nearly as difficult as the great step the colonies took back in 1901 or prior to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should we choose to debate the entire constitution&mdash;the role of local government, the duplication the states represent to sound administration and so on&mdash;then it would indeed challenge the debates of the 1890s for its complexity. But if the convention focuses on the head of state alone, its task will be far easier than that which faced the architects of Federation&mdash;but, I would suggest, far shallower in reform than the situation demands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we can learn from our forebears and the way they tackled the issue and worked towards a common goal that has benefited so many future generations. That is why it is so important for us to get this right and to ensure all Australians have their say. For that reason, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I will be supporting the opposition amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Banks (Mr Melham) and other opposition speakers have already said, the way the proposed government appointments are weighted under this bill will ensure there are 25 delegates from the coalition, 13 from the Labor Party and two from the minor parties and the Independents. As much as I would love to be a part of the process, I realise that I represent only a tiny fraction of the national electorate, but I do question the way in which the Independents will be chosen.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am concerned, that incident is now history and the proposal the member for Warringah was commenting on at that time is not exactly what we see today. But we do not want to see a constitutional convention that can be accused of `going the right way' from the monarchists' or any other point of view. This gathering of delegates must be seen to be transparently open and fair. It is not fair for it to be slightly or otherwise weighted towards people from Liberal and National Party backgrounds&mdash;or the other way&mdash;just because they happen to be in political favour at this point in our history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can almost judge how they will vote at the convention, judging by some of the comments we have listened to over the past few days. I find it hard to accept the remarks of the member for Griffith (Mr McDougall), for example, when he says that the Governor-General and not the Queen is our head of state. Have a read of the constitution. Take a coin out of your pocket and see whose face is on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us keep that debate for the convention&mdash;a convention with equal representation of views, with equal opportunity for all Australians to take part&mdash;not taking part by just sitting down and filling out a ballot and mailing it, but by stepping forth on polling day, because this vote is as vital as any other the people of this nation will ever take. The republic deserves to be debated, discussed and voted on in a fair, open and honest manner. For that reason, I will be supporting the amendments moved by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="r120">the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill </XREF> and oppose the amendments moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). I must say that it is unfortunate that the Labor Party and others have continued to politicise this debate. The aim of the coalition, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, is to give the people of Australia the form of government they want, rather than seek to impose a form of government that we want. That is in contrast to the Prime Minister's predecessor&mdash;the politically late, unlamented Mr Keating&mdash;who was determined to impose on the people of Australia a republican form of government, ignoring totally the fact that our existing system has delivered to us freedom, stability and a way of life that is the envy of people throughout the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) pointed out that the current Prime Minister is clearly not Australia's most enthusiastic republican, but what he has sought to do is deliver on a core election promise. He has sought to facilitate consultation with all sections of the Australian community, and thus we find ourselves debating the bill currently before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is eminently regrettable that those opposite have not picked up the challenge of the depoliticisation of this debate which is necessary if we are going to have any rational debate on our constitutional future. Ardent republicans&mdash;as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis&mdash;were well aware that the greatest enemy of any change to Australia's constitutional structure was the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating. The way in which he turned this into a party political issue basically meant that people would vote on party political lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Prime Minister intends to consult the Australian people. He has brought forward a system which will ensure that the constitutional convention later this year is able to focus on Australia's constitutional future, particularly as we approach the end of the decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to point out, however, that I believe the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) was quite wrong when he 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3521"> suggested that, by looking at the way the appointed delegates will be chosen, one could predict the outcome of the constitutional convention. The Liberal Party, the National Party and indeed the Labor Party are all parties which have people who are monarchists, people who are republicans and people who are ambivalent. I believe it is insulting the intelligence of Liberal and National Party premiers and other persons elected to parliamentary office to assume automatically that, because one is a Liberal, a National or a Labor Party person, one will adopt a particular course of action at the convention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is unfortunate that the honourable member for Melbourne does not join the government's attempt to depoliticise this issue. It is a pity that he is using this place to campaign for an Australian republic. This debate is not about whether we should remain a constitutional monarchy or whether we should become a republic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate is all about facilitating discussion. It is all about talking with the Australian people. It is all about getting this matter out of the realm of politics and into the realm of the Australian people. Of course, the Australian people own our constitutional future not the politicians. The honourable member for Calare also suggested that, in having a voluntary postal vote, we were in some way breaching the constitution. Voluntary voting was used in Australia federally until about 1923 and it is not a matter of constitutional requirement that we should have either voluntary or compulsory voting. So what he had to say with respect to that is simply not relevant. Other people have suggested that the voluntary postal ballot will be the thin edge of the wedge, that in fact this is a precedent and that the government is trialling voluntary voting at this constitutional convention with an aim to introducing voluntary voting generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put my cards on the table. I am in favour of voluntary voting at national elections but no way in the world could the voluntary postal vote provided for in this bill be deemed to be a precedent. Even those of us who suggest that Australia should have voluntary voting would never claim that we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should have a voluntary postal ballot. The reason we are having a voluntary postal ballot has been made perfectly clear and it really ought to be pointed out once again. We inherited a $10 billion black hole when the now Leader of the Opposition left office as Minister for Finance and Deputy Prime Minister. We will save $15 million to $20 million by having a postal ballot and I believe that is eminently the right way to go.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the honourable member for Melbourne ought to sit down and listen to what I am saying. What he ought to do is to encourage those opposite to support the government's bill and to withdraw the amendments currently before the chamber. Postal ballots have been used successfully by the Australian Electoral Commission on a number of elections. They have been used successfully in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania by those states' electoral commissions. The bill currently before the chamber has been looked at by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee to make sure that the electoral system that we are bringing in through this bill is properly considered. We are going to be very careful to ensure that we do not allow any opportunity for fraud. The Australian Electoral Commission is well regarded right throughout the world as being a very reputable body. The Australian Electoral Commission will guarantee that the postal vote has security, transparency and integrity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to outline some things that will be included. The AEC will put in place mechanisms to detect any attempts to vote more than once or to vote in the name of another person. This includes pre&hyphen;printing every returned envelope with the elector's name and address and a unique bar code. Before the votes can be counted, voters will be required to sign declarations that they have voted only once and they will be required to include their date of birth on the declaration. This will be checked and, if there is any uncertainty, the returning officer must be satisfied that the declaration was signed by the elector. Where an elector claims not to have received ballot material, replacement 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3522"> ballots will be provided to ensure that the elector does not vote twice. Where both ballot papers are received, the returning officer will count only one vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People say, `Why are we having a voluntary vote with respect to the constitutional convention?' It should be noted that the convention itself does not have any decision making powers. The convention itself is not going to determine whether Australia remains a constitutional monarchy or becomes a republic. What the convention is about is consulting the Australian people and any recommendations or any consensus that might emerge from the convention will indeed have to be endorsed by both the parliament and by the Australian people at a referendum in a compulsory vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the Leader of the Opposition comes in here and criticises the voluntary vote and the fact that the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) does likewise are just spurious attempts to politicise this entire process. The government, through the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Senator Minchin), has looked at our promise and has sought to facilitate discussion and consultation of the Australian people. It really is appropriate at this point in time to place on record publicly my congratulations to Senator Minchin for the job of consultation and for the job that he has done. He has brought forward this proposal which I believe is widely accepted by the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also believe that, given the fact that we are electing people to a convention and not to parliament, it would be entirely unreasonable to consider prosecuting those who choose not to vote or indeed sending them to gaol, as has happened with respect to some who have chosen not to vote at parliamentary elections. The other thing that ought to be noted is that, even in voluntary elections in many parts of the world, the turn out in many cases is quite similar to that at compulsory votes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not electing a parliament. This is electing a constitutional convention to consider the question of whether Australia remains a constitutional monarchy or becomes a republic and once that process of consideration has taken place, obviously there would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be a vote in the parliament and a vote of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is really ironic that those opposite&mdash;having nearly killed off the republic through the former Prime Minister Mr Keating&mdash;are now coming in here and endeavouring, once again, to politicise this entire process. They simply cannot help themselves. They simply find themselves unable to participate in a bipartisan way, which this government is seeking to do in this place as a government. We have people who are monarchists; we have people who are republicans; and we have people who really are prepared to listen to the debate. What we are trying to do is to facilitate a process. We are delivering on an election promise and those opposite continue to seek to frustrate it. No doubt, when the bill gets to the Senate, they will seek to do the same thing there, and it is unfortunate, because whenever they do that, they turn people off. They disillusion people and, regrettably, they continue to politicise this matter which ought not to be a political issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has also been criticism of the fact that we are not discussing other aspects of constitutional change. Clearly, there is a great concern in the Australian community over the way High Court judges are appointed. There is also a concern over the way High Court judges have acted in making the law&mdash;inventing the law&mdash;rather than simply interpreting it. There has also been a demand by local government for constitutional recognition. There has been widespread concern in the Australian community over the misuse of the external affairs power of the Commonwealth by the former government and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could look at a number of other issues, if one wanted to. The government seriously considered this but we thought that, if we had this as a forum to discuss every wish list as far as constitutional change is concerned, we would be accused of seeking to frustrate the process. What the government wants to do is to have this issue of Australia's head of state considered first and foremost. We are not running away from our election promise. Although the other matters may well be considered by the government in due course 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3523"> in some way or other, the constitutional convention to sit towards the end of this year will be focused on whether we should remain a constitutional monarchy or whether we wish to become a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole issue is a complex one. It will require considerable time for discussion and should not be sidetracked or held back by other issues. If we discussed all of the other possible constitutional changes over a period of 10 days, we simply would not get anywhere. We simply would not have any chance of achieving a consensus. It is false to criticise the government's decision to focus on Australia's constitutional future as far as being a monarch or a republic is concerned. The opposition really ought not to continue to criticise the government in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not admit that any change is necessary. The Leader of the Opposition said that we ought to be encouraging change. Other members opposite said that we ought to be grasping the nettle and advocating an Australian republic. The simple fact is that this is not a matter for politicians. It is a matter for the Australian people, and the government will resist any attempt by those opposite to continue to politicise this matter and to turn it into a party political issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our aim is to ensure that there is full consultation. If there is any decision by the Australian people for change, it ought to be achieved through a process that unites rather than divides the community. The former Prime Minister was the great divider. He was not interested in consensus. He was determined to ram his ideas through whereas our current Prime Minister is facilitating a debate so that he is able to listen to the battlers of Australia who were ignored for 13 years by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we want to do is to get it right. If we are going to remain a constitutional monarchy, so be it, if that is what the Australian people want. If we want to become a republic, so be it, if that is what the Australian people want. If we do opt for change, obviously the change ought to unite rather than divide the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Prime Minister suggested that, if we were to move to a republic, the head of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> state&mdash;the president&mdash;ought to be elected by a majority of two&hyphen;thirds of the parliament and the reserve powers of the current Governor&hyphen;General and the monarch ought to remain. He also suggested that the powers of the president should not be justiciable and that the president would be able to be dismissed through a vote of two&hyphen;thirds of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Harry Gibbs, one of Australia's most eminent jurists, pointed out that such a model could well turn into a republican dictatorship because, if there was a desire to sack the president, clearly the parliament would have to be called together for that purpose. The president would clearly hear of a proposal to sack him, and it would be quite simple for him to prorogue the parliament. There would, therefore, be no parliament to impeach him. In that situation, because his powers could not be challenged in the court, we would have a republican dictatorship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My own view is that there must be an overwhelming case made for change before we risk the freedom, stability and way of life that we have and which is the envy of the world. We tend to think of ourselves as a new country, but we are about the sixth oldest democracy in the world. Democracy is a fragile flower. Our constitutional arrangements at the moment have much merit. I do not see any point in change, particularly if we are going to risk becoming a republican dictatorship. I do not see any point in change unless the Australian people will be demonstrably better off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am more than happy to have a constitutional convention at which half the representatives will be elected by the Australian people, and they will join the appointed representatives to talk about Australia's constitutional future. The government has got the balance right. No doubt, governments will always be criticised for making decisions&mdash;and this is a decisive government, a government which has taken whatever steps were necessary to bring about and facilitate this very important debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some cynicism has been expressed about the appointed delegates. It ought to be recognised that the government will announce the names of the appointed delegates after full 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3524"> consultation, prior to a vote being taken for the elected delegates. The government has sought to represent the states and territories in an appropriate way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) and, I believe, the opposition have both criticised the government because it has not provided for an equal number of government and opposition representatives at the people's convention. The simple fact of the matter is that the Australian Labor Party has been comprehensively rejected, not only by the people of the Commonwealth but also by the people of every state and both territories, bar New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a hide, what gall, what audacity the Labor Party has to crawl into this place and demand equal representation, even though, at election after election after election, the Labor Party has been rejected. Democracy is not about having a vote and being rejected and then getting representation. It is important to recognise that democracy is about seeking the support of the Australian people and accepting their verdict.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not go my entire time today because I am conscious of the fact that many issues have been covered already, but I would like to make a few points regarding this particular issue. We are here today to consider the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill which basically sets out the parameters for the Constitutional Convention. The question which is to be addressed is the question of whether Australia becomes a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How important is this issue? I think it is a very important issue because it is about the question of our national identity. It is about how we project ourselves internationally. It is also about how Australians see themselves and how they see themselves progressing into the future. However, having said that, is it the most important issue we face? Clearly, it is not. There are many other issues which relate to the general operation of society today, and into the future, which are also crucial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of our national identity does impact upon those other issues in many different ways. Certainly, at the moment there is a debate which has been going on in Australia in a more general sense, many components of which have been quite outrageous, which also looks at the question of our national identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, other issues are important and those who have said that the Labor Party, and particularly the former Prime Minister, was about this issue and nothing else, effectively undermine the question of its significance and misunderstand the operation of modern government. Even when this was an issue which was getting considerable media coverage in earlier days, when it was championed by the former Prime Minister, many other things were going on around government at the same time. Much was being done as the debate continued. The fact is, it is not the only issue we face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current system is also something that is often raised by people in this debate. I put it on the record that I think Queen Elizabeth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> II, as a monarch, as Queen of Australia, has done a fine job as far as it goes. However, the question of a monarch and a head of state resident in the United Kingdom but who also operates in relation to Australia is essentially hard to understand. The relevance of that to Australian society is difficult to justify. The question of relevance as we head into the new millennium, of how we operate as a country, and of how we utilise the offices of a head of state, are also very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of issues I want to raise which result from comments made by the previous speaker. Concerning the issue of a republican dictatorship, the view that we should maintain what we have because it has served us well, the old slogan, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it', has some appeal except that I do not think anyone is talking about ending up in a system which could lead to a situation of a republican dictatorship. That is really quite a ridiculous line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think any sensible commentator around this issue would reject it. Any fair-minded Australian who is considering the detail of what is being proposed, will be proposed, and can be proposed and what will eventually go to a vote of the Australian people will realise that that is not the intention and will not be the result of what is undertaken by the parliament and eventually by the Australian people. It certainly will not be the result of this convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another view that has been put is essentially that the previous Prime Minister was about imposing his republic. You heard it on the TV and you heard it by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard): `You will get the republic you want, not Keating's republic.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have got to clarify just what the previous government was proposing. Essentially, the first point of reference in terms of the question of what would happen was to be a national plebiscite, involving all Australians, on the basic question, `Do you want a republic?' If that was successful and indicated 50, 60, 70, 30 or whatever percentage support for that initiative, there would then be conventions, discussions and development of specific proposals and then a referendum.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3526">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument often put by members of the other side in particular and others, who are not party political but involved in this debate, that in fact it was not going to involve the Australian people&mdash;that it was not going to be a situation where you got the chance to have your say&mdash;is absolute rubbish. I think that it does the debate no good to consider it on those grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue that has been raised by many other speakers is the question of politicising the issue. This argument goes that decisions should not be an issue of party politics and that this one is becoming so because of the actions of the Labor Party. I think you have got to consider the nature of politics. The fact is in this House and in the media, debates are continued upon the question of, `What do we want to see occur within our society?' Whether it is the question of tax rates; of home and community care; of immigration or of who is to be our head of state&mdash;all issues by nature are political. The question of whether it should be seen as being a party political issue is another point. There are people of varying opinions about what should occur throughout this chamber in varying degrees. It is fair to say that there is probably greater unanimity that we should become a republic on this side of the House than there is on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that to suggest that politicisation has occurred around this issue is really quite ridiculous. It is an issue which relates to what is Australia going to be into the future. Such issues are by nature political because they require people to take sides. They require debate about what should happen and they require, in the end, people making decisions for themselves about what they see as being the way forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conduct of this election for this convention is in fact in itself political. Not party political but, as has been made clear, there will be tickets running for election to this convention. There will be tickets from the constitutional monarchists. There will be tickets from the Australian republican movement. There will be tickets from a range of different organisations representing different views along the spectrum. What you are being asked to do is basically to pick a side. I think 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it is fair to say, given there is a central question involved in the conduct of this convention, that people should be expected and will be expected to state where they stand on this particular issue. I think it is also fair to say that the overwhelming majority of those who will stand for election to this convention will have a view one way or the other. They may vary at the edges, but essentially, there will be pro&hyphen;republic candidates and pro&hyphen;monarchist candidates. That is their right and I respect that. I do not have a problem with that but I think to argue that it is not political is ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the question of the coalition at the moment, you can look at the question of the way the Prime Minister has handled this issue. We see an example of the sort of problems that he has been facing in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, the Prime Minister is trying to take the politics out of this issue by subterfuge. He is trying to do the same thing with a number of other issues. Basically, he is trying to take the politics out of the coalition. He is finding that, in government, he is in a position where he has to make decisions, and those decisions have consequences, and so there is a difficulty in terms of holding the coalition together on a range of different issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, that was the problem the coalition faced on this question of a republic when it was first raised. That was one of the principal reasons why, rather than going one way or the other on that particular issue, we ended up referring it to a committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it clear that we support the bill. However, amendments can be made to improve it to make it more representative of the views of Australians, more inclusive of the involvement of Australians, more able to cover the issues in a way which will ensure that there is some scope for consensus&mdash;they find that difficult&mdash;and so that it gives a clear indication of the will of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister is a monarchist. He is quite open about that. I respect his view&mdash;I do not agree with it, but I respect it. He did not really want to be engaged in this debate. He does not see it as being crucial to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3527"> Australia's future. He thinks that many other issues are more important. In some respects, he is right. There are other issues that are more important, as I mentioned earlier, but to suggest that we cannot address more than one issue at a time is a Gerald Ford argument&mdash;you can't chew gum and think at the same time. I do not think that is the case. In this country we are capable, both as a parliament and as a people, of considering more than one issue at once. Lord knows, we have to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal as it stands and as it was developed is designed to avoid decisions being made. The Prime Minister has talked about how he hopes this convention will lead to the development of consensus. However, the strategy behind it, the mode and the process of election, will work against that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For one thing, we are talking about a situation where there will be tickets. A number of delegates will be elected. Some will be stated pro&hyphen;republicans and some will be stated pro&hyphen;monarchists. Although I have great respect for the individuals involved, I cannot see a situation in which we will get agreement between Digger James and Malcolm Turnbull on the way to progress this issue. Essentially, they are coming from diametrically opposed positions. So there are difficulties in terms of coming to an agreed position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people who oppose what we proposed&mdash;an initial plebiscite&mdash;do so because they are anti&hyphen;change. The intention of the plebiscite was to give an indication to delegates, through a convention, of the will of the Australian people on the general question of, `Do we want a republic or don't we?' That indication is important because what will happen now is a situation where the elected delegates will have differing opinions, and it is fair to say that there is unlikely to be an overwhelming majority one way or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With voluntary voting, the turnout will be down on what we normally get at federal and state elections. That will, in itself, allow those who oppose the basic proposition of change to say, `Look, a lot of people did not turn out. They weren't concerned.' Others have mentioned the United States and the appalling turnouts at their general elections. Others have mentioned a hidden agenda on this issue, with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the coalition seeking in the future to move our system from compulsory to voluntary voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compulsory voting is not really compulsory. What happens in this country is that people are required to attend a balloting place and to have their name struck off the list. If they do not want to vote, they can turf the ballot paper. If they do not want to vote, they can vote informal. A number of people choose to do that&mdash;and that is their right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nature of the way our system works means that we have turnouts of around 90 or 95 per cent, whereas in the United States 15 or 20 per cent of the people can decide who is the President. The American system could have a worrying impact on the way democracy in this country works and how our society works in terms of extremist minorities, from whatever side of the spectrum, gaining a foothold, what they could do to the operation of our system, and what that would mean for ordinary, everyday Australians and the conduct of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the postal ballot situation, over the term of a federal parliament, even in 18 months to two years, something like three million Australians will move house. Many of those people, although they are required under the law to notify their change of address to the Electoral Commission, will not do so. It is the sort of thing&mdash;and I am one of the people who can plead guilty to this on occasion&mdash;which you often forget to do and do closer to the particular election only when you have heard the election being announced on the radio or the television. The fact is, a lot of those people will not make the change of enrolment and, through a postal ballot system, will not receive ballot papers and will not have the opportunity to vote. Something like 200,000 Australians will probably be overseas at the time of this vote, and they also will miss out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not an inclusive process. In the circumstances that we are talking about, the instructions are only in English. That suits the overwhelming majority of the population, but it will make it difficult for many Australians&mdash;many Australians who are very proud to have come to this country, to have made it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3528"> their home and to have contributed to it. It will make it extremely difficult for them to actually cast their vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the voluntary voting and with the postal ballot you are seeing a circumstance which is going to denigrate the result before it is actually achieved. It will give the opportunity for whichever side that, in effect, loses at the convention to attack those results and cast aspersions on their legitimacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Others have covered the question of appointed delegates and other issues. I will not go into that today; I think that has been covered quite carefully by others. The basic point I will finish with is that the Prime Minister says he wants consensus but he has designed a process, through this convention, which will avoid it. We see a situation of division, which he says he opposes, and that consensus, that comfortable and relaxed atmosphere that he seeks for Australian society, will be very difficult to achieve through this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the initiative of the convention because it is the choice that we face today. We support changes to what is being proposed because we think it can be improved and we think that, through that process, a better, more equitable and more agreeable solution for the Australian public can be achieved. We look to a situation where that will hopefully come through this convention process, although we have our doubts. I commend the bill to the House, but I commend, particularly, the amendments that are being proposed as an opportunity to make this a real attempt to address this issue as we move into the next century.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end of the century mood in the 1890s was a catalyst or intensifier which encouraged the founding fathers&mdash;no founding mothers&mdash;to get on with it. From Henry Parkes' Tenterfield speech of October 1889, which revived the federation movement, until the inaugura 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion of the Commonwealth in January 1901 was barely 12 years. The range of issues which faced voters in the six colonies in the 1890s was very much wider than the narrow issue to be put before the 1997 convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first Australasian Federal Convention of 1891, an Australian republic was spoken of by a few delegates as a long&hyphen;term goal&mdash;perhaps a hundred years or so later&mdash;without arousing paroxysms of enthusiasm or rage. Our founding fathers took a pragmatic view. Unlike the Americans a century earlier, they did not think they were writing a document for all time; it was simply the best compromise that could achieve approval by the British government and acceptance by the six colonies. Even so, it took a decade to jump these hurdles. There was a proposal, soon defeated, that the Governor&hyphen;General should be directly elected by the voters&mdash;and that has a distinctly contemporary ring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A century ago, fear of isolation and concern about external threats persuaded six Australian colonies to join in a federation. This continent&hyphen;wide aspiration sought nationhood within the British Empire, linked by the Queen, a promise of protection by the Royal Navy, White Australia and, to a degree, tariff protection. Parkes and later Griffith, Deakin, Isaacs, Kingston, Barton, Symon and other founding fathers had some vision, but they recognised that there were practical limits to how far they could go. Australia had a small, scattered population and a huge continent with poor communications&mdash;Todd's telegraph and primitive telephones notwithstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The white population was overwhelmingly English speaking and nominally Christian. Many citizens had been born in Britain and may well have seen themselves as mere transients here. The constitution of 1901 was a compromise document which needed to satisfy the different needs of six colonies before it could be put to popular vote. It also required the imprimatur of the imperial government&mdash;particularly difficult when Joseph Chamberlain, the then Colonial Secretary, dreamt of an empire which was to be an organic unity, tied together politically, economically and through trade. Hence, the British government retained the right of veto 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3529"> on Commonwealth and state legislation, under section 59.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A century later, in the 1990s, there is a comparable move towards national redefinition, with the beginning of a new millennium as a psychological target. White Australia and tariff protection are both gone. The British Empire no longer exists. The United Kingdom is increasingly integrated into the European Community, both politically and economically. The relevance of the British connection is coming under challenge. Britain is no longer a major trading partner, although still a significant investor here, and the Royal Navy no longer guards our shores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before the House is a very cynical exercise, designed to create a situation which is programmed to fail. It could be more accurately described as the `Constitutional Convention (Impediments to Voting) Bill 1997'. It creates an obstacle race, setting up hurdles to actually discourage voting. It is in very sharp contrast to our existing system. Voting is to be voluntary&mdash;in other words, to persuade the community that it is not a very important vote; voters do not really have to turn up; voters do not have to own the result; voters do not have to have a personal commitment or investment in the result. It is to be a vote that is postal, not a vote by attendance. It will be non&hyphen;secret, in effect. If you read those extraordinary provisions, you will see you not only have to sign the ballot but also confirm it by indicating your date of birth. If voters forget to put in the date of birth then, presumably, the vote is invalidated. That is in proposed clause 68.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, by implication, excluding non&hyphen;English speaking voters. None of the material provided will allow for explanation to those people who are not of English origin. It is extraordinary how much detail is provided to ensure that voters in Antarctica are given the right to vote but there does not seem to be any provision to ensure that voters in London are given the right to vote. It is quite extraordinary to see the contrast there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Father Frank Brennan SJ has pointed to the oddity that `there is an elaborate statutory scheme for the voluntary electoral process but no statutory basis for the convention itself. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There ought to be statutory provision for the convention's procedures, including the law of privilege, for the setting of the agenda and for the choice of the chairman of the convention and any deputies'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) calls himself a monarchist and he also supports what he calls `the existing system'. I am a republican and I also support `the existing system'. The problem is that the Prime Minister's approach could be described as the `empty room' theory of constitutional monarchy in which the qualities of physical absence and political indifference by the monarch are the major assets. If one asked the Prime Minister where the national focus was, he would fling open the doors of an empty room and say, `See! There's nothing there. Isn't it wonderful? And it works.' We must be able to have more than the empty room theory of constitutional sovereignty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The growth forecasts set out in the budget are in the eyes of most economic forecasters very conservative and, therefore, extremely achievable. The budget attacks the issue of employment on two fronts. Firstly, it improves the economic outlook for jobs by taking pressure off interest rates. I would remind the parliament that, since this government came to power, there has been a reduction of 1.5 per cent in interest rates and that has saved business about $3.6 billion in interest payments. It also puts us on the path of long-term growth rather than the boom-bust cycle that was so characteristic of the former government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also a number of direct measures contained in this and the first budget my government brought down last year which deal directly with the issue of employment. There is the $1 billion Federation Fund for nation building projects. There is the $1.25 billion fund for environmental projects, bitterly opposed by the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. There is road funding of over $1.6 billion that will create and sustain 19,000 jobs. There is a regional communications strategy that will spend $250 million in regional Australia&mdash;once again, a proposal opposed tooth and nail by the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a work for the dole proposal. In the primary industry area, there is spending on quarantine of $75 million over four years to protect the clean, green image, giving more exports and more jobs. In rural policy, there is a $200 million package to improve the outlook for Australian farmers and regions. In relation to the regional forest agreements, we are continuing the drive to fix the forest issue with a balance for jobs in conservation, and we have created 400 jobs from the first of the RFAs in the East Gippsland area. More generically, the major reforms that my government has carried out in the small business area will provide valuable help, valuable incentives, to the small business area.</PARA>

Just as this government has turned away from Labor's deficit and debt and begun saving again, so it is time for individuals to be encouraged to save.

The government that delivered it was the coalition government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of the things that we will be proudest of in a term of achievement. By reducing the tax on savings we have given Australians the opportunities to save. This is a saving opportunity which is open to all. The Labor Party wanted to be discriminatory. They did not want to give the aged the opportunity to save. They did not want to give parents who were looking after children at home the opportunity to save. They did not want to give people choice in saving because what the Labor Party was all about in relation to superannuation was not encouraging savings but delivering financial power to the trade union movement.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. The government introduced a number of significant initiatives in last night's budget in relation to health and family services, and they have three basic priorities: first, to address areas where there have been unsustainable rates of increase in growth; second, to look at areas where we can improve outcomes for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> public; and, third, to maintain our fundamental commitment to keep Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have done in the health portfolio is rein outlays back from a 5.5 per cent average over the 10 years to 1995-96 to 2.6 per cent real growth over the forward estimates. The fact is, though, health expenditure is still going up and health expenditure is increasing as a share of government expenditure. Our key initiatives are in the public health area, where we are funding programs that were due to expire, and funding a number of immunisation initiatives. We will, for the first time, be making the hepatitis B vaccine universally available and part of the immunisation schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we have been able to come to an agreement with the Department of Finance about a new process for listing new vaccines so they do not have to go through the budget process in a similar way to the cost effective criteria which apply to pharmaceutical benefits. This is good news, and the first vaccine being assessed under this is the acellular pertussis vaccine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area where we have announced a new initiative is in the national mental health strategy, a six-year strategy which was due to expire next year. We have said we will keep the national mental health strategy going beyond that time in conjunction with the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put new money into the acute care sector, which is $40 million over four years, particularly to strengthen the evidence and research base of public hospital treatment. We are introducing electronic claiming for Medicare benefits, which will do a few things. Firstly, it will be a significant boost to the public in terms of easier access to Medicare benefits. Secondly, it will give general practice an incentive to computerise. Unfortunately, at the moment only half of Australia's general practices have a computer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are spending $15 million new money on emergency relief, $17 million new money on rural health and $15 million over one year for the palliative care program, which we hope to be able to wrap up into the Medicare agreements from 1998.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3536">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are introducing a new system of scholarships called the Howard Florey scholarships. That will be for bright, young Australian researchers who are currently overseas, who want to get back to Australia and who cannot because there is no position for them. They will not be in the position that Professor Doherty has been in, where we lose our great researchers overseas and they do not come back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rural initiatives will be of particular interest to the member for Forde, because rural health remains one of our top priorities. We are introducing additional places for specialist training in rural areas and, because of some of the intractable problems of trying to get doctors into country areas, we will be looking at a range of innovative service delivery programs. One of these is obstetrics. A lot of country people simply do not have access to obstetrics services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are making some substantial changes to the pharmaceutical benefits system. But that in the end will be to bring the pharmaceutical benefits system back from 15 per cent real growth to 7.8 per cent real growth. The expenditure under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will still go up substantially. Even with the changes we are making next year, the increase will be $300 million over and above the amount we are expending this year. All in all, this will strengthen Australia's research base and put health policy on a much sounder evidence based footing, and that bodes well for the long term.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Which side of politics last increased the rate of sales tax? It was Labor yet again. We have not increased taxes. We have maintained discipline and we will have a budget surplus next year. </PARA>

It was the Labor Party that thought it was fair to lock 20,000 young Australians out of the universities. It was the Labor Party that thought it was fair to prevent Australians getting into universities on the same terms that they were prepared to admit overseas students. They understand so little about higher education policy that the member for Werriwa thought that the coalition policies would cut access to universities by 30,000. The facts are that this year, as I announced to the parliament yesterday, the universities have enrolled 26,000 students above the targets they set for this year. That is how we have expanded access.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No initiative is more important in this budget for regional Australia than the impact that we are going to have on access for students who need Austudy to move away from home to study at universities. This initiative in the budget recognises the fact that families in regional and remote Australia incur additional costs when they have to move away to study. From 1 July this year the dependant deduction for second and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> subsequent eligible tertiary students will be doubled from $3,700 to $7,400. The effect of this decision is to increase the parental income cut-off point at which Austudy is paid for eligible tertiary students. It means that more students in rural and regional Australia will get Austudy and that many of those receiving Austudy will increase the amount of Austudy that they receive up to $925 per student. These are significant improvements to the Austudy system.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has recognised the extraordinary work and commitment that is made to our community by carers. We have recognised that by putting in place a genuine plan for them and those they care for. This involves additional funding of $120 million over four years.

It builds on the $36.7 million that we allocated in the last budget to implement the national respite for carers plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centrepiece of our package for carers is a $16.60 increase in the rate of the domiciliary nursing care benefit paid to carers.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Hughes for her question. Last night's budget reaffirmed the government's commitment to the education, and the quality education, of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia's three million school students. Unlike the Labor Party, this government cares about the literacy and numeracy needs of young Australians and recognises the importance of these needs for young Australians to get jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget provides an extra $152 million for Australia's 10,000 schools. Commonwealth funding is increased in this budget by some four per cent, up from $3.6 billion to $3.75 billion in 1997&hyphen;98. This includes $160 million for literacy to help ensure that every child is reading and writing properly at the end of grade 3, $156 million for special learning needs and $54 million for languages. It also includes some $20 million from the vocational education and training budget to expand vocational education offerings in schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is delivering on its promise to improve education standards after the disastrous period of Labor in office. The legacy of 13 years of Labor is that one in three 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds cannot read properly and that many young people are dropping out of school because they cannot find relevant programs that will help them to get jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new Labor spokesman for education, the member for Werriwa, has also unveiled Labor's new education policy. No&hyphen;one in this chamber knows about this policy, I feel sure, because it did not receive any press coverage, which was lucky for the member for Werriwa because his policy could lead to the closure of 300 schools. In a speech to the Centre for Public Policy at Melbourne University some two weeks ago he stated that the Labor Party would introduce a minimum enrolment number of 50 students per school before a school would get funding from the Commonwealth, with a minimum enrolment of 20 students in rural and remote areas. And he said&mdash;he made this claim&mdash;that schools with these numbers of students did not have the support of their communities and he would not fund them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister is a new boy, but let me just tell him a few facts. There are at least 331 government primary schools in Australia with 20 or less students in them and 35 non&hyphen;government schools.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my 20 years now in this parliament, seven of them in opposition and including quite a lot 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of accumulated experience of other countries during that time, I can recall no budget speech more arrogantly and complacently unresponsive to the real economic needs of a country than that of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in this place last night. And nowhere was that failure more evident than in the arrogant, contemptuous failure to deal constructively with the issue of jobs and job security, overwhelmingly the biggest economic problem this country now confronts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was not the only failure in last night's budget. The failure to provide financial security for retirees, in a way that both we and the government had promised in previous years and in a way that we have been discussing in question time today, was an outrageous failure. It was lousy in its morality and its economics, and it is a failure we are going to hear more about later in this debate. So too was outrageous the failure to deal decently with Australian families, particularly the struggling and disadvantaged members of our community who will continue to be subject to the kind of onslaught by this budget that was commenced last year, and on which issue you will be hearing a great deal more from us in the period ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the greatest default last night in the budget was unquestionably on the subject of jobs. There was just one sentence on the subject of unemployment in that entire 12&hyphen;page speech. There was no expression from the Treasurer of any human concern about the scale of the tragedy unfolding out there in the community, with 800,000 Australians wanting work who are out of work. There was not even an expression of economic concern about the tragic waste of resources that is involved in that underutilised human potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nowhere in the Treasurer's speech last night was there any expression of regret that unemployment had in fact become worse over the 15 months that they have been in office, increasing from 8&half; per cent to the nearly 8&frac34;that we see at the moment. There was no apology for the fact that youth unemployment is now worse, nor for the fact that long&hyphen;term unemployment has now become the highest it has been for the last two years, with nearly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3546"> a quarter of a million people&mdash;on yesterday's figures&mdash;now out of work in that category. There was no recognition that job creation&mdash;in the way that it had to be stimulated if we were going to see some advance in the situation which is now so tragic for so many people&mdash;has simply evaporated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was no analysis, moreover, in last night's speech of why all this has happened. There was no analysis as to why economic growth has fallen away, no analysis of the impact of the slashing of so many Public Service and public sector jobs over the last 15 months&mdash;the last two budgets. There was no analysis of the impact of abandoning industry support policy in the way that occurred on such a spectacular scale in last year's budget. There was no analysis of the impact on the unemployment situation of abandoning regional support policy, which was such a crucial part of our approach to this, but now has disappeared completely from the horizon. There was no analysis of the effect on rising unemployment of cutting education and training funding, abandoning the job readiness and the labour market job skill training programs that were so crucial a part of our strategy. There were no positive proposals in last night's speech to do anything whatsoever about generating jobs, generating job security in the future. It was all a barren, tragic wasteland on this issue last night. You turned the pages of that speech and of the other budget documents, looking for inspiration, leadership, direction and some hope on this issue. All of us found absolutely, precisely nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter is that, for this government, unemployment is a second, third or fourth order problem. However, there is no doubt that it is not a second, third or fourth order problem so far as the Australian community is concerned. The most recent opinion poll evidence of that was the AGB McNair poll just before the budget, reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>: `Voters put employment top of their budget list.' Sixty&hyphen;seven per cent of respondents rated the reduction of unemployment as the most important issue the budget should address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter is that out there in the community there was a big expectation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that this budget would address the unemployment problem head on, that we would hear from the government a spelt&hyphen;out set of strategies to stimulate growth and restore those labour market programs that were so crucial in establishing job skills and job readiness but which were slashed last year, that we would see something to restore the incentives and support to efficient industries to generate new jobs, and that we would see something to generate new momentum in the regions, especially those which have been hard hit by recent economic or business decisions, Newcastle being prominent and conspicuous among them most recently. The community had hoped that we would see some money spent and some commitment made to straight&hyphen;out job creation programs, in order to cover the very real transitional problems that exist in our community at the moment while we are waiting for growth to take hold and other measures to generate more sustainable jobs. But those expectations were profoundly and comprehensively disappointed. On all of these issues the Treasurer had three&hyphen;fifths of five&hyphen;eighths of damn all to say, and that was outrageous and a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether or not the government admits it, we all know the scale of the problem of unemployment&mdash;or I hope we do. The question is what the government can and should be doing about it. The government's response, as we have heard over and over again, is to say, `It is all a matter of labour market flexibility. The cyclical problem will look after itself and, as to the structural problem of unemployment, labour market flexibility will fix that under the workplace relations bill when it comes into full force, effect and operation.' But, frankly, there is absolutely no&hyphen;one in the country who believes that to be true, including the Reserve Bank Governor, Mr Ian Macfarlane. At the ANU in September last year, he gave a very polite little answer on the issue of whether labour market flexibility, through the present legislation, would have that effect&mdash;about as polite as a Reserve Bank governor ever gets when he is rejecting a policy position on which the government of the day has its heart. The Reserve Bank Governor said, very politely and very kindly, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3547"> that he was agnostic. He did not believe it and nobody believes it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is possible that, if labour market reform, so&hyphen;called, is taken to the kind of extremes that some people on the other side want to take it to&mdash;if we do go down the American path of having a deregulated labour market that will result in that market being cleared at poverty wage levels&mdash;then we might do something to improve the notional level of people in employment. But at what social cost?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no good going down the US path unless you are prepared to accept with those US figures the whole box and dice of US social problem implications that flow from it. As Ken Davidson said the other day in a very interesting article, it is all very well to compare the US figures with ours, but you have to take into account, among other things, that there is one very big difference between the American labour market and ours, that is, a very significant proportion of it is in gaol. There is about four per cent of the American work force tied up in the correction system at any given time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not making a cheap point against the social conditions in America. I am simply making the point that there are social consequences when you have an economic system that pushes people into depressed wages and that creates the kinds of social conditions that the other side of the House over there is so keen to talk about. You cannot get there by decent means unless you adopt a completely different strategy. The truth of the matter is that, to generate jobs in Australia, you have got to have a much more sophisticated, multifaceted strategy than anything we have seen capable of emerging from the other side of parliament at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have got to have, in fact, a strategy which addresses simultaneously five different issues. The first thing you have to do is generate internal demand in the domestic Australian economy through budgetary and interest rate policy which is growth oriented and deliberately designed to generate that demand. The second thing you have got to do is harness the domestic Australian economy to the international economy so that you get the benefit of extra demand that is out there, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particularly in our own Asian region. That means trade policy and foreign policy that integrates Australia with that external demand and makes it possible to take maximum advantage of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing you have got to have is industry and regional development policy which is supportive, selectively crafted and operates in such a way as to translate that generalised demand into specific business opportunities and specific job opportunities. The fourth thing you have got to have is job skill creation through education, training and labour market programs that ensure that you have got the skill base in the Australian economy to take advantage, again, of that demand when it picks up through your other strategies. If you do not do that, you get inflationary bottlenecks through skills shortages&mdash;even worse, you export the job opportunities overseas. You abandon at your peril education, training and labour market and job readiness programs. They are crucial to ensuring that you can manage the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, what you need&mdash;I make absolutely no apology for saying this the other day and saying it very often&mdash;are some transitional job creation strategies to recognise the reality that we now have a very large pool of long-term unemployed people who, with all the formal skill training in the world, are going to find it difficult for quite some time yet&mdash;until this economy picks up and stays picked up for a long time yet&mdash;to get jobs. Work for the dole is no solution in this situation. You have got to be prepared to actually get out there and create through carefully crafted public spending jobs that do, in fact, meet community needs, through environmental measures and community service measures of this  kind can provide rewarding and fulfilling job experiences and can provide, hopefully, some experience and training that will make people more job ready for the future but nonetheless just meet that need of keeping people in work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You need to address every single one of those things to get it right about jobs. How many of those issues, how many of those five themes, were addressed in this budget last night, in anything this government has had to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3548"> do? Answer: none of them. The government has misconceived the nature of the task, misconceived the nature of its policy responsibility&mdash;abandoned its policy responsibility&mdash;on every one of those fronts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as growth is concerned for a start, beginning at the beginning&mdash;I have about one minute on each of them&mdash;this is not a growth oriented budget any more than was last year's budget. The forecast is for 3&frac34; per cent. That is less than what the growth needs to be&mdash;must be&mdash;if we are going to make a significant inroad on unemployment by generating a higher level of demand in this country. We are perfectly capable of generating four&hyphen;plus per cent growth. We did it for our last three years in office, and a good deal of the period before that as well, and we saw unemployment coming down as a result&mdash;from 11 per cent to 8&half; per cent&mdash;over that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to go out there and have deliberate strategies, however&mdash;both budgetary and interest rate strategies&mdash;to achieve that result. It does not just happen, and it certainly does not happen if your whole approach to budgeting is contractionary, if you are obsessed with the balance and surplus bottom lines, if you do not understand the dynamics that are at work in the economy, and if you are simply not interested in generating the growth that the economy is capable of delivering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course that growth has to be sustainable. You have to have regard to the inflation constraint. You have to have regard to the current account constraint. But, on all the knowledge we have about the way the economy is structured at the moment, the way it is working, those constraints are not applicable in such a way as to inhibit growth moving along at much better than four per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has no confidence, obviously, that it is capable of generating that level of growth. Certainly, the figures that it is using about the unemployment that will flow from the growth that it is predicting are simply themselves hardly believable. But they are not very satisfactory figures at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trade point needs to be made very quickly. You do have to have active strategies if you are going to harness the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> economy to the external one. That does not just happen. You have to have good, sensible trade policy and good, sensible foreign policy&mdash;God help us&mdash;and you have to have trade promotion strategies which are designed, again, to make those linkages. What have we seen in the last budget and this one? We have seen the decimation of the capacity of Austrade to do the job that everyone knows it can. We have seen the decimation of EMDG and ITES and a whole variety of trade promotion support mechanisms and budgetary mechanisms that were crucial for us making that connection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things tucked away in this budget, which frankly just appals me, is that we have seen the demise of NTIOC&mdash;the National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference. Started three or four years ago, it has become Australia's most successful window on the trading world&mdash;literally thousands of delegates, a huge event in Melbourne each year. Now, for want of $1.3 million worth of government subsidy, it has been abandoned on the never-never promise that maybe it will be picked up the following year by some private company if there is a buck to be made from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry and regional development policy&mdash;it speaks for itself. This is a government which has just created a barren vacuum so far as that is concerned. It does not understand the necessity for having targeted strategies. It is not business welfare, it is national welfare&mdash;as Heather Ridout from the MTIA was saying the other day&mdash;to have sensible research and development strategies. It is not business welfare, it is national welfare, to have carefully crafted subsidies and strategies that are designed for particular industry sectors inherently affected and for particular struggling regions&mdash;like South Australia, like Tasmania and like Newcastle&mdash;to have that support which enables us to make a difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen what has happened with education, training and labour market programs. They were decimated last year and have remained decimated. They have not been picked up in any rational or sensible way by further measures in this budget. If anything, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3549"> things have gone backward with a further cut in vocational training and, overall, a reduction in support in those sectors. As for job creation, all we have got is the whiteboard federation plan looming its scurrilous scam-like head so far as the future&mdash;18 months out before the election&mdash;is concerned, plus the work for the dole, which is not going to produce the kind of training experience or work experience that will make any difference to anyone. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a pathetic attempt! The matter of public importance itself relates not just to job creation but also to financial security for retirees. There was not one word from the spokesman on behalf of the Labor Party, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), on the question of financial security for retirees. The reality is that financial security for retirees was a focal point in last night's budget. The honourable member from the Labor Party had every understanding of that and refused to address it because there was nothing to say other than to congratulate the government on the manner in which it has brought forward a number of initiatives that will give that security to so many people in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party cannot and will not ever be able to stand up with any credibility on the question of employment. We heard the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in question time today assert the fact that, in the last year of Labor, 57,000 jobs were created. Let me take the House through the last five years of Labor. The last five years of Labor saw a net increase in full&hyphen;time employment in this country of 7,100 jobs. It started in the early 1990s when, of course, the recession we had to have destroyed over 300,000 jobs in this country. That recession we had to have was as a result of a major contribution from the then Labor government to the economic policies governing this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party was 300,000 behind as they started the 1990s, and who became the minister for employment in December 1991? It was none other than the current Leader of the Opposition. What was the unemployment figure in December 1991? I will tell you. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployment figure was 10.4 per cent in December 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two years transpire and we move to December 1993. Who was still the minister for employment? It was none other than the current Leader of the Opposition. What was the unemployment figure in December 1993, two years after the current Leader of the Opposition had the opportunity to do something about jobs, to reduce unemployment in this nation? The unemployment figure in December 1993 was 10.6 per cent. Over two years under the stewardship of the now Leader of the Opposition, unemployment increased by 0.2 per cent from 10.4 per cent to 10.6 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To turn around that very important problem, which is very much in our focus, very much to the forefront of the policies which we have instituted, this government has put the conditions, the foundations, the ingredients in place. The ingredients are, firstly, to stop the waste that we saw under Labor, to stop the increasing burden of debt, to stop spending what we do not have. We have already seen a $12 billion turnaround in terms of the management of the Commonwealth's finances in the context of three budgets&mdash;last year's, this year's and leading to next year's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That in itself has an impact downwards on inflation. That in itself has an impact downwards on interest rates. That in itself, with the initiatives of last night to encourage national savings, leads to that climate which gives certainty to small business, in particular. It gives the confidence that small business needs to expand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have stable inflation at the lower end locked in. They have low interest rates, and there is every indication that those interest rates will continue to remain low on the basis of the policies of this government. And we can add to that initiatives promised before the election, delivered in full at the last election, to assist small business&mdash;the engine room of growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only did we deliver on the provisional tax uplift factor reduction from eight per cent to six per cent and on the tax involvement in the capital gains rollover, not only did we deliver on bringing through reform of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3550"> labour market&mdash;the opportunity for flexibility, the opportunity for enterprise agreements&mdash;and not only did we bring them through in our first year, but we also responded to the Bell small business deregulation task force with a very significant commitment to getting rid of that red tape. We responded with a further $600 million over four years of support for small business. We continued to do that in last night's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have public savings because this government will not operate on deficits, not like our predecessors. We will not spend what we do not have. We have private savings through last night's initiatives that were given in the context of the budget that was delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), and the encouragement there for people to save and to get a tax rebate for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard today in the House a whole lot of posturing on the question of what it means. Let me say just one thing in terms of what it means: for anybody who gets any deduction in terms of their savings&mdash;if it is as little as $1, if it is as little as $100 or if it is as much as $450&mdash;it is all a hell of a lot more than they were ever going to get under Labor's policies because Labor never had an initiative to encourage savings in respect of the public generally. They certainly did nothing to make a contribution towards national savings on the basis of the debt and deficit programs which they went into year after year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will pay off $5 billion of debt in the course of being in government for just 14 months. We have set in place programs and a fiscally responsible approach that will lead to a halving of public debt. We are paying $10 billion in interest at this point in time. That was doubled in the last five years of Labor. We will reduce it by half by the turn of this century, and that leaves room to put in place other programs as we stop paying for the debt that Labor ran up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just go to some specifics in terms of the programs in last night's budget. What is the natural heritage fund if it is not a job creation program? There is $1&frac14; billion there for job creation programs, particularly in respect of regional Australia. What is the integrated rural policy, $200 million? It is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about assisting those who are out there on the land and it is about ensuring that they continue to not just survive but progress and employ in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the Federation Fund about? Tell the people in the ACT that several tens of millions of dollars in the building industry in the territory is not going to create jobs and they will laugh at you. That is what Labor is trying to bring forward. What is the work for the dole scheme? It is a base for people to get the understanding of what working is about to progress through to some meaningful job as they go past that particular point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the money that is in this year's budget for the apprenticeships and the traineeships? There is additional funding for those. There is incentive and encouragement in dollars for big business to extend the traineeship program. There is support there to ensure that those who have lost their jobs are picked up again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the $76 million dollar for AQIS mean? It means hundreds of jobs to ensure that diseases do not creep through our borders. What is the small business innovative fund? It gives $130 million to small and medium sized enterprises to get out there, to get some additional work, to expand and to create jobs. Labor can throw buckets of money at employment programs&mdash;as they did under One Nation&mdash;but they did not bring unemployment figures down; they did not create real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economics spokesman from the Labor Party was out there yesterday saying that what we really need to do is develop some sort of transitional job creation, some sort of artificial program that will ensure that there is a transition that will assist. You have to have a base; you have to have an economic climate; you have to have policies in place that lead to sustainable growth. We started that program last year. We have continued it and expanded on it this year. That will bring certainty and confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this budget delivers in terms of that confidence is a number of things. Let me just comment on a couple of them. We have business investment continuing to grow. It grew last year; it will continue to grow 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3551"> strongly this year. We have the housing industry going through a recovery after having an oversupply for years. The housing industry is just so important to what happens in our economy. We have consumer spending strengthening. That is one of the indicators that we all wanted to see come back. We are now seeing signs of that coming back. We have inflation remaining low and interest rates are down. We have the foundations in place to see growth and to see employment develop in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor did not address the financial security for retirees. Let me say a few things about it. It is in the motion, but the honourable member for Holt did not say one word about the financial security for retirees, despite the fact that he put up this matter of public importance. How important was it that you had 15 minutes to talk about financial security for retirees but did not say one word about it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Gareth Evans interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HQ5">Mr FAHEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, he tells me that he is going to have his second speaker address it. He obviously had nothing to say about it because he could have only said what a good job the government has done. Let me just say a couple of things that will not amount to blowing my own trumpet or the government's trumpet on that particular issue. Let me quote a number of statements that have come since last night on the question of retirees. The Council on the Ageing said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has definitely improved its outlook on community needs in this Budget compared to last.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Investment Funds Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other announcements in the Budget package clearly mark out this Government's retirement income policy and will contribute to community certainty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Minerals Council of Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the decision to abandon the second tranche of the legislated tax cuts in favour of measures to stimulate savings is welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Master Builders Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government therefore is commended for pursuing job growth as one of its main policy priorities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What we have seen is a ringing endorsement from a number of people in respect of jobs 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and a ringing endorsement from a number of organisations in respect of retirement policy. What does that retirement policy do? It gives incentive and encouragement to Australians to put some money into superannuation because they will get a tax deduction for every dollar they put in. It gives incentive and encouragement for people to go into a number of other forms of saving to look after themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We preserve the benefits. Labor talked about it but never did it. We have done it. We have preserved the benefits of the contributions by employer or employee to ensure that there are benefits there for their retirement. We give to the self-funded retirees greater financial security because every one of those who is living off their income will get the full $450 tax rebate that is there for savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is very clear that there are some considerable initiatives in this budget relating to the financial security of retirees. The savings initiatives used for retirement or any other purpose apply to everybody. They do not apply on a discriminatory basis&mdash;which is what Labor was proposing under their ill-fated, stupidly prepared l-a-w tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sort of policy that Labor pronounced years ago never provided the money, never put it into the budget, never ensured that it was ever going to happen because they knew they could never face their union mates on that question and say, `We're going to hit every person on a wage, the battlers&mdash;whatever their rates are&mdash;including all union members, with a three per cent after tax additional tax slug.' That is how you were going to finance it at the end of the day. You never would have delivered, you never could have delivered and it was only going to relate to those people in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The self-funded retirees know that they have an additional $450 this year in addition to what they got last year, which was the increase in the threshold of the tax that they paid&mdash;up from $5,400 to nearly $11,000&mdash;and in addition to the fact that they got tax deductibility for private health funds through last year's budget. We have given, in addition to those two initiatives, a further $450 this year. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3552">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ringing endorsements that are coming in to this government are clearly a recognition by those people approaching retirement and in retirement. The associations that represent them are very clearly indicating that they appreciate and applaud what the government has done to give them the financial security that is there. The deferred pension bonus plan is another initiative that encourages people to make some provision&mdash;by choice, not by compulsion. The compulsion that Labor proposed under l-a-w is not part of what this government is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, this budget is about job creation because it has the fundamentals in place. It has the climate right. It has the ingredients there to ensure that business expands and has certainty about its investment. It has national savings improving to ensure that there is investment that will flow from those savings that are there. It is about jobs. Growth will come. It is about retirement financial security.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) talks about ringing endorsement. I think he is hearing the wrong sort of bells. After this budget, the bells toll for thee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard from the Minister for Finance about what they were doing about employment. The simple facts of life are that in the last 14 months that this government has been in office, employment has increased by 92,000 and full&hyphen;time employment has increased by a miserable 4,000, compared to Labor's last 14 months in office, when employment increased by 263,000 and full&hyphen;time employment increased by 192,000. So do not talk to us about all the jobs you are going to create; just try to match us. This budget shows that you have no possible hope of matching us. You are on track to fall short of our job creation program in the last three years by 290,000 jobs. You are on record for a shortfall of 290,000 jobs on the projections in this budget. So do not lecture us about employment. You are failing massively on employment compared to the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centrepiece of this budget is the savings rebate scheme. That scheme is a rip&hyphen;off 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and a sham. It is a rip&hyphen;off because all wage and salary earners and many self&hyphen;employed people will now be deprived of the hundreds of dollars per year they would have received from Labor's savings scheme which this government promised to introduce in the election campaign  but has now scrapped. It is a sham because, whilst it masquerades as a boost to savings, the real story is that, unlike Labor's savings scheme, it will reduce national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to the rip&hyphen;off point. In the 1995 budget everyone will remember that Labor promised to introduce a savings scheme funded from the second leg of the tax cuts, which would require all employees to contribute three per cent out of their after tax pay into superannuation and there would be a matching co&hyphen;contribution from the government, dollar for dollar, up to $1,000, or three per cent of average weekly earnings at that time. It was subject to an income test, which would phase it out at twice average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign the coalition promised to introduce that savings scheme if they were elected. Let there be no walking away from that. Page i of the `Federal coalition's superannuation and retirement incomes policy' says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will meet the Government's co&hyphen;contribution commitment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is absolutely clear. They talked about reserving the right to vary the mechanism, but the commitment to meet the co&hyphen;contribution in full was made, and made several times. It was a promise they made to the Australian people. It is a $4 billion promise, which they walked away from last night. It was a $4 billion promise which they pulled the plug on. Most wage and salary earners and many self&hyphen;employed who would have benefited from Labor's scheme are big losers as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor a worker on average weekly earnings who contributed $1,000 a year to his superannuation fund would have received a matching $1,000 from our co&hyphen;contribution into his superannuation fund. Under the HowardCostello scheme his $1,000 contribution to superannuation gets him a tax rebate of $150. That is $850 a year short. He has been ripped 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3553"> off by $850 a year&mdash;the $850 he was promised by this government. It is extraordinary that they can pretend they never made this promise and try to walk away from it and say, `Hey, you're a big winner here; there's a beaut scheme here for you.' The fact is that these people&mdash;millions and millions of Australians&mdash;are losers as a result of this action by the government last night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that to get the $450 rebate that is all over the press, you have to have $3,000 of superannuation contributions or investment income of $3,000. It is only those who have substantially high incomes and that level of superannuation contribution or that level of investment income who are going to benefit. Someone on $100,000 a year would get a $450 rebate on their $3,000 superannuation contribution under the Howard&hyphen;Costello scheme. Under us they would have got nothing because they would have been means tested out of it. Our scheme was designed to help the low and middle income earners, not the well off. The Howard&hyphen;Costello scheme is the reverse. It is all about helping the well off. Only reasonably well off people are likely to have $3,000 a year in investment income, as I have said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People with little or no savings, such as low income earners, low income families especially, pensioners and the unemployed will receive little or no benefit from this scheme because they have little or no savings on which to receive the investment income. Someone with savings of $5,000 and interest income of $250 would receive a rebate of 72c a week. Wowee!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scale of this rip&hyphen;off is just immense. When fully operational, Labor's scheme would have paid over $4 billion a year. This scheme gives just over $2 billion when it is fully operational. So it is a $2 billion plus rip&hyphen;off. It is a rip&hyphen;off from low and middle income earners in this country, not the rich, who are the beneficiaries of this. They are benefiting while everyone else is suffering. That is what this scheme is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's scheme is an absolute rip&hyphen;off. There is no doubt that this scheme is a complete rip&hyphen;off for low and middle income earners and that this government is cheating 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them of several hundred dollars a year without a word of apology. No&hyphen;one has said, `Gee, we're sorry we can't afford this;' they just pretend they never made the promise and try to tell them that there are some goodies here for them. They should be apologising abjectly for their total breach of promise and failure to deliver. It is not just to deliver in terms of the individuals in Australia; it is delivering for the nation. As I said, this is a sham of the first order. But the failure to deliver to the people and then refuse to apologise and try to deceive them shows that this is a government which has no shame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the sham aspect, let me say that their savings scheme does not increase national savings, contrary to the claims made by the government. Labor's scheme, as shown by the Treasury retirement income modelling task force calculations, would have boosted national savings by 1.4 per cent of GDP by 2005 and over two per cent of GDP by 2020. This was on top of the boost that came from the superannuation guarantee scheme, which would have given us another two per cent. We would have increased superannuation savings by 10 times, to $2 trillion by the year 2020.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Treasury, our scheme would have provided a major boost to national savings, but the additional saving of two per cent of GDP from Labor's SCG scheme has now been lost. Instead, we have a scheme that is likely to reduce savings because, firstly, the money spent on the tax scheme is a loss to national savings. The tax rebate reduces national savings, and the money paid out as a tax rebate will be largely spent because it is paid to people to spend as they like. Most of them will probably save a little of it but they will spend most of it, whereas all of Labor's payment with the co-contribution went into savings. There was no leakage to consumption. It was totally saved. This is a dramatic difference between the two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, because of the way this scheme is designed, the inducement effect for increased savings is likely to be very small because the scheme is not targeted in any way at rewarding additional saving. Instead, it will reward current savers, who will receive a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3554"> bonus for doing what they were already doing without the bonus. Thus, private pension recipients, shareholders with dividend income, landlords with rental income, investors in interest bearing deposits, investors making capital gains and partners in business will all be eligible for this bonus for doing what they were already doing. Where is the boost to savings? Many of them will fully utilise this with their current entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many of them there is no incentive to undertake any further savings because they have the maximum investment income they can get from what they are already doing. So why would they bother making any more savings because of this? It will not give them anything. In fact, people could even reduce savings and receive the benefit, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) pointed out in question time. So this measure is little incentive to increase savings. In essence, it is just a handout to those already saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the scheme does not require people to hold their savings for any length of time. They can get the rebate one year and then spend it the next, which is just ridiculous. In other countries where these sorts of schemes have been introduced there is usually a holding time requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My time is running out, but let me say simply: this scheme does not have the approval of Treasury. The mark of that is all over it. Treasury reported in its economic round-up in 1995 that the OECD found that such schemes do not improve savings. Of course, this contains no figures from the retirement income modelling task force showing what the boost to savings will be. Do you know why that is not there? Because there will be no savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much for the charter of budget honesty. When the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said that this savings scheme would knock your socks off, he was misreported. What he really said was: `This'll knock you suckers off.' And in saying that he was 100 per cent right.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the only suckers that were knocked off were the Australian public&mdash;knocked off, I might say, by the previous government. Never 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> before have I heard such a pathetic attempt to demolish the coalition's budget. I would like to echo the words of the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey): the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) did not even address half of the matter of public importance&mdash;pensioners. Obviously pensioners rated very little in the scheme of things when his party was in government and they rate very little now. For the 13 years that Labor was in government, they failed to look after their core constituency and they created for this country high levels of unemployment and huge levels of debt, which threatened not only the battlers but also the security of pensioners. I suppose what logically follows is that because they failed they expect us to fail. Quite frankly, we will not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know why those opposite even put this matter of public importance up for discussion&mdash;I suppose it deserves a response seeing it has been listed for today&mdash;but I would like to examine two aspects of what they have put before us today. The first relates to the jobs issue. If we are going to create jobs we need, firstly, a climate in which the jobs rate can grow. I reiterate that in this budget there were no new taxes&mdash;no new income tax, no new sales tax, no new company tax and no increase in the fuel excise. We have reduced the deficit and, in so doing, removed pressure from interest rates. Clearly, this will encourage small business to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a savings initiative which will reduce the reliance on foreign debt, which in turn will form the basis for steady economic growth. We have the Federation Fund and the Natural Heritage Trust Fund, with a total of $2 billion between them. The focus of these funds is to create not only national pride, pride in our 100 years of government, but also pride in our heritage. But the heritage fund goes further. It goes into rivers, land restoration, various forms of foliage, micro-environments and the like. The opposition feels this money will be spent willy&hyphen;nilly. Of course it will not. It will be spent in a structured way, and delivering these programs will in turn create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking through our budget papers, people will see that, far from neglecting jobs, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3555"> we have put a lot into creating them. For example, we will spend $1.6 billion on labour market assistance in 1997-98 and, on the work for the dole scheme, $17 million&mdash;not to mention our small business package, the reforms to the delivery of employment services to the unemployed and the recently announced changes in IR reform. Then we have $41&half; million over three years for the Green Corps. Surely Labor cannot criticise these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the opposition have the great gall to come into this place and knock the coalition. Let me take honourable members through part of Labor's record when they were in government. The ALP under Keating drove us head&hyphen;on into a recession that we had to have. It was the ALP government that destroyed 400,000 full-time jobs. Under Labor, unemployment rose to a massive 11.2 per cent in December 1992, its highest rate since the Depression in the 1930s. Under the ALP, for three years our unemployment rate was higher&mdash;note this&mdash;than 10 per cent and for 32 consecutive months it was higher than it was at the end of the war&mdash;32 consecutive months! You would think that in three budgets they would have been able to make a bit of an impact on that, wouldn't you?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From June 1990 to the election of 1996, Labor created only 35,700 new full-time jobs. Under Labor the percentage of people in part-time work looking for full-time work or more hours rose from 19 per cent in 1983 to 26 per cent in 1996. In Labor's last five years of government, youth unemployment went to 27 per cent and at times touched 30 per cent. It is interesting to note that, under the previous coalition government, which experienced a lot of the same difficulties as the former Labor government, youth unemployment never rose above 17 or 18 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As if that was not enough on the national scale, let me take you into the Wide Bay statistical region, made up of my electorate and that of my colleague the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). From December 1991 right through to the election, for 4&frac14; years, we had almost consistently, with one or two exceptions, 13 per cent unemployment. At times it went to 14, 15 and 16 per cent. For 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the three months prior to the election it was at 18.9 per cent and 20 per cent&mdash;twice the national average. That was the legacy of Labor in my electorate of Hinkler and in the electorate of Wide Bay. Some legacy!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So today in the parliament they adulated themselves for their marvellous labour market programs&mdash;these programs that achieved so much for people! They were nothing more than a cruel hoax that recycled young people from one level of hopelessness through a period of Indian summer into another phase of hopelessness. Just have a listen to the cost per net impact of some of these programs: jobstart, $3,700-odd; job clubs, $6,100; skillshare, $3,800; jobtrain, $7,000; wait for this one, job skills, $76,500; and the doozey of them all, the much celebrated, the last desperate attempt of Labor to seal their place with the Australian public, the NWO program, the new work opportunities program, $143,000 per net impact. Just think how many jobs that could have created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that was not enough, we even had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition going through this nonsense that somehow they had a marvellous regional package. Before I came into politics, I spent over 20 years in regional development and I know what regional development is about. If ever I saw a badly structured program, it was the REDO program. It was full of promise and delivered absolutely nothing. If you sat down, took out a pen and analysed what it was offering, you could see that it was really nothing more than a sham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite apart from the fact that it duplicated what in five of the six states was already present by way of local regional development boards that could have been quite easily funded by the government, what did they do? They provided $150 million over four years to 41 regions. Just work that out. Take $150 million, divide it by approximately 40 regions, divide it by the number of years, then take off a third&mdash;a massive third&mdash;for administration and then you can see that it was nothing more than a sham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It had no sense of ownership because it was not based on local membership. They were Labor hacks who were appointed to most of these committees. Not only that, they deliv 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3556"> ered a cargo cult mentality. Everyone thought that this manna was about to come down from heaven, and it did not. They were excessively bureaucratic. They promised at first that there would be no bureaucracy with this&mdash;not at all. Within 12 months they were endowing these committees with $200,000 a year for administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that what we saw today was nothing more than an absolute sham. They were disgraced in government in their labour market programs, they were disgraced in their regional programs, they showed no care for the old and the infirmed and then they have the gall to come in here today and try to criticise what we are doing about jobs and for the aged. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on this issue, I find myself once more having to take issue with both sides. I heard the Labor spokesman talking about the importance of their labour market programs. Quite frankly, they were greatly overstated. I was in the Labor Party caucus when Paul Keating said that the future lay in the service sector. The service sector is political code for tourism. It was from that point on that we stopped training metal trades apprentices. As a consequence, you cannot get a boilermaker now in Kalgoorlie, Bunbury, Port Hedland, Gladstone or anywhere where there is any development required, because we stopped training them. Australia, the country that used to provide arguably the best metal trades apprentices in the world, now produces drink waiters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also needs to be made clear that while you have 8.7 per cent unemployment, and that is an artificially low figure, there will be a continual erosion of wages and conditions, and there is nothing government or the unions can do about it. I think the opposition are right when they say that there needs to be transitional job creation programs. But they are wrong when they say that work for the dole cannot work. If it is properly structured, work for the dole can be very useful. But I fail to see any reason to believe that the government understand this. If there is going to be work for the dole, it would clearly be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> much better to administer it through local government, who actually understand the problems. They have the skills to administer and they have the jobs that need to be done. I urge the government to rethink their position and manage their scheme through local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to do transitional job creation, it is quite clear that roads are a big priority. Roads in my electorate create real new wealth: every mile of road built has the potential to open up a new mine, creating new wealth and new real employment. Roads built in the city can only cost&mdash;and that is a point that seems to be not understood by either party. The best welfare is a job&mdash;a good, worthwhile, credible job. There seems to be no evidence that this is on the minds of either party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true: there are people in the opposition who believe that a deregulated labour market is the answer. A deregulated labour market can take us down the American road. I have been there and I have seen it. In 1973, the Americans declared class war on their own people and now they have 20 per cent of those people in gaol. They are incarcerating people at a rate 10 times that of Europe and about four to five times that of Australia. They are using gaol as a remedy for unemployment, and building gaols is one of the growth industries in America. You see areas of very low wages. You see areas where illegal immigrants are being employed at very low prices&mdash;being exploited. That is the America of today. It is not a pretty picture. It is certainly not something which we would want in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the budget, there was a clear absence of an industry policy. But there is no sign either that the Labor Party see a need for an industry policy. They mouth the jargon. In the debate today I heard talk about small business being the powerhouse of job creation. What a fine platitude and how well the government and the opposition like to mouth it. The truth is I do not believe there is any real understanding of the problems of small business and I do not believe that the government come anywhere near in addressing their needs 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3557"> in this budget that was brought down yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has to be an industry policy. And this does not mean just blind re-introduction of tariffs, although I do not resile from tariffs under some circumstances. There are lots of other things governments can do. One is to change the government's purchasing policy&mdash;foolishly changed by a Labor government&mdash;to capital cost. The real criterion should be through live cost. If through live cost is the criterion, Australian products shine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just give you a few examples relating to a town on the east coast of Australia&mdash;Sydney. In Sydney, you have probably the last integrated truck manufacturer in Australia&mdash;RFW. RFW were consulted by the Australian Army for the purchase of 55 recovery vehicles. RFW have got a lot of expertise in this area. They are probably the premier constructors in the world of large off-road four-wheel drive vehicles. The army opted for Mercedes-Benz. Each one of these units creates between 2,000 and 2,500 hours of work&mdash;in round figures, 137,000 hours of work per year or 34,000 weeks of work. What is the cost of giving that to Germany? They ended up buying from Mercedes-Benz an overgrown Unimog six by six. Given the enormous trouble that we have had with the Unimog vehicles, the need for recovery vehicles is in part to recover the damn things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example of the stupidity you have to deal with is that the army bought Mack trucks because the American army bought Mack trucks. The Americans have much better roads than we do in a lot of our country, where our trucks do not run on bitumen. The trucks were so rough the army could not carry troops in them for any distance. They did this for occupational health reasons. They decided that they would have to change the suspension. Australia invented air suspension. It was invented by Permatrak in Sydney and they offered to re-equip all the army Macks with the Permatrak suspension&mdash;the one commercially chosen not only in Australia but throughout the world&mdash;for $16,000 a pop. The army signed the contract with the Americans at $22,000.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that RFW did not tender. They just said, `Take away your 12 inches of tender documents. This is the price. You know it works commercially. Every truck in Australia is running on these things. You know it's a superior product. Our price is this. See if you can better it.' The army signed the contract at $22,000, and the trucks are still unrideable. That is what you are dealing with. And no government seems to have the will, the wit or the wisdom to take on these facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at another example&mdash;a qango&mdash;Qantas. Qantas purchased 30 RFWs. Remember, when I am talking about this one little company in Sydney, I am only talking about their construction hours, not about the hours of the people supplying the castings, the electrical or the other components&mdash;just their own construction hours. One can undoubtedly add substantially to that figure. Qantas bought 30 of these catering vehicles and they were well satisfied with them. They get a consultant, however, who, for whatever reason, decides that he will buy on price, so he sources the next supply of vehicles&mdash;over 100 of them&mdash;from Sweden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first Volvo that came from Sweden fell to pieces. But Qantas will still persevere and buy 100 of these things from Sweden when it could have got a superior vehicle from Australia. The cost difference was not that great and of course the taxpayer of Australia gets an enormous clawback when the government collects a 30 per cent tax on the wages that were paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no sign that any government on either side, of any persuasion, is prepared to tackle these real issues which go to the heart of an industry policy. It gets very depressing when you see both sides of this parliament get up and blackguard each other, blame each other for the problems, when it is quite clear that neither of them care or understand what needs to be done. There is so much that we can do in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall when we were buying helicopters for the Australian Army. I was involved in the committee that looked into this. The air force, which were foolishly left in charge of the acquisition, very quickly ruled out the Westland helicopter, for reasons of their own. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3558"> Westland had a superior machine and they were going to transfer all the technology to Australia. They said to us, `In five years, you can build helicopters.' We are right next to the biggest potential market for helicopters in the world, which of course is China. They said to us on that committee, `My word, you can build anything in Australia. There is nothing you can't do. You have these enormous facilities&mdash;a government aircraft factory that is the best in the world.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our committee voted for the French because they had a better machine than the Black Hawk and they were giving us transfer of technology. But the government of the day opted for the Black Hawk. Of course the problems that we have with the Black Hawk are now absolutely legendary. I have run out of time. I could talk for hours on this subject. It is close to my heart. Without a manufacturing industry, there are no jobs in the future and there is no end to the current account deficit.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to explain that the Senate amendment No. (3) allows members of unfunded defined benefit funds to pay the surcharge liability as it accrues rather than when the benefit is paid. What this means is that members of unfunded defined benefit schemes are treated in the same manner as other superannuation funds where members can make additional contributions to cover the amount of the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate amendments Nos (4), (5) and (6) are consequential on the amendments to the change in the tax file number arrangements and allow the Commissioner of Taxation to amend an assessment where a tax file number is subsequently quoted and where no surcharge had previously been applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senate amendment No. (7) changes the definition of `adjusted taxable income' to remove eligible termination payments paid from superannuation funds, rollover funds and lump sum payments for unused annual leave and unused long service leave received when 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an employee's employment is terminated because of bona fide redundancy or under an approved early retirement scheme or because of invalidity. This amendment prevents low and middle income earners being caught up in the surcharge in the year they receive their retirement benefits or other superannuation lump sum payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will be agreeing to those amendments, but let me make it quite clear that the government maintains that the surcharge measure was all about reducing the tax concessionality in superannuation. High income earners gained large tax benefits from the concessional tax treatment of superannuation. The surcharge is not about raising taxes. Even after the surcharge, superannuation continues to receive concessional treatment. The Senate is quite clearly grandstanding and playing for cheap political points by relying on the surcharge and asserting that it is a tax. The government does not accept that the surcharge is a tax. The government does not accept in any way that it has broken any election commitments on new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the government does want to get this package of legislation through the House because these bills are now two budgets old. To avoid further obstruction from the Senate over these bills, particularly from the opposition, we will accept the amendments. Despite the claims of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to be supportive of the surcharge, the Labor senators in the upper house defied their leader and voted against the bills in the Senate. Labor senators evidently took the statesman's view that, as the surcharge affected them, the surcharge could not possibly be in the public interest. Let the responsibility for this action in the upper house be squarely on the opposition and minor parties if there are any unforeseen consequences from the amendments to this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in his bemusement at the action of the Labor Party, at the insistence of my Independent colleagues and I voting for these measures in the House of Representatives and then doing exactly the opposite up in the Senate. I do not think anyone could put any rational 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3561"> explanation to that. I expect it will only be a token attempt. Anyway, it did give the Treasurer (Mr Costello) the opportunity to have a few gibes at the opposition in question time&mdash;and I suppose that could be said to be entertaining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, of course, I cannot imagine how the minister or his government has the gall to continue the line that a surcharge is not a tax. Look up your thesaurus. `Surcharge' is a synonym for `tax'. If you want to play around with the language, you are free to do so of course, but it really is very childish. Why that charade has been perpetuated I cannot understand. Even the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), is embarrassed about it because he knows it to be childish and just an attempt to avoid the use of the correct adjective to describe what the government was proposing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess after several months of perfecting the art of tax avoidance&mdash;the coalition, that is, avoiding calling a tax a tax&mdash;the government has finally conceded that its 15 per cent superannuation surcharge is indeed a tax. That is despite the words of the minister who spoke to the motion before the chair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In agreeing to replace the word `surcharge' with the synonym `tax', the government is also clearly coming clean to having broken one of its 1996 election promises of no new taxes, as it did indeed with its selective Medicare impost. Why pretend? You have broken a few promises and we understand why you had to do that, but to go through with this pretence is a little bit irksome and I do not think it brings any credit upon the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to clause 5 of the original bill will mean minor changes to the way in which the superannuation tax will be applied to funds for which no tax file number, TFN, is provided to the fund manager. The government initially intended for the full 15 per cent impost to be levied against any superannuation account if the account holder failed to provide the TFN. The general consensus amongst the taxation fraternity and fund managers was that that was quite unreasonable. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate amendments will have the following effect. If a TFN is not provided, if an individual's superannuation contribution does not exceed the contributions threshold of $2,000 and if the contributions began to be paid before 7 May 1997, then the account will not be subject to the new tax for that year. However, if the TFN is provided at a later date, these contributions will be reassessed and subject to the additional impost. If the contributions amount does not exceed the threshold limit, and if the account holder commenced payments prior to 7 May 1997, then the full 15 per cent tax rate will be levied against the contributions for that year. Any contributions made after 7 May this year will also be hit by the 15 per cent superannuation tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate nominated 7 May as the date of effect, as it was the date on which the amendments were first canvassed. The clear intention was to discourage taxpayers from opening multiple small superannuation accounts in order to avoid paying the new tax. The amendments to clause 5 of the principal act will see little change to the cumbersome procedure that the Commissioner of Taxation is obliged to follow in obtaining TFNs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The commissioner will be accountable for ensuring that every fund contributor who fails to provide their TFN receives two letters advising them of their compliance obligation. According to the legislation as now proposed, the commissioner is to determine `the most appropriate' address for each fund member. This is absurd. The commissioner earlier described the super tax as an `administrative nightmare'. I am quoting the commissioner. It is even more nightmarish after the inclusion of these Senate amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can anyone argue that this amendment meets the criteria of simplicity and efficiency, which are two of the three measures of a reasonable tax? Quite simply, it does not. Even the revenue that it is reckoned will be raised by these measures cannot justify the principal measure because it involves bad, bad, bad, bad law&mdash;it is bad law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate's amendments have determined that, while the surchargeable contributions 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3562"> threshold for the 1996-97 financial year is $2,000, it will be indexed on an annual basis. That is a reasonable inclusion. The amendments to clause 5 are also of consequence for those in clauses 16 and 19. Clause 16 in the original bill describes the various alternatives for reducing the surcharge debt available to fund members. It also indicates the procedures that the fund provider must follow if a member does opt to make payments to reduce the deferred amount in the surcharge debit account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with the words of the Commissioner of Taxation, this procedure is unmanageable and is likely to&mdash;in fact almost definitely will&mdash;increase compliance costs for fund managers. So you have the additional cost of collection because of these amendments on top of already horrendous collection costs and you have equally untenable compliance costs by the fund managers. Nothing in these amendments is going to change that and in fact will exacerbate that state of affairs. In all likelihood these increased costs will eventually be passed on to those fund members who are liable to pay this new tax, as well as every other Australian taxpayer who contributes to a superannuation account. Despite the justification for some of these amendments in the Senate, that will be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated in my speech on the second reading of the cognate bills, this tax is destined to affect many people not originally intended to be caught in the net. At the same time, up to 60 per cent of the supposed high income earners, who are the main targets of the tax, are working with their accountants to minimise the effect of the superannuation impost. Some of them will flee from the system. It is as simple as that. Where is the equity in that arrangement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 43 was also amended during debate in the Senate. The effect of this particular amendment will be to exclude those who receive redundancy and invalidity payments from the additional superannuation tax. This is a worthy amendment; this is worth while. From the beginning the government handled this legislation in a very careless manner. As a result it has further damaged the already 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fragile confidence that fund contributors have towards superannuation. Superannuation is not the preferred savings option for most Australians. As I indicated in my speech during the second reading debate, Australians will not use superannuation more than necessary unless they are confident of stability in both the industry and the system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS>  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Successive governments have continued to destabilise superannuation, at least since 1994, with the release of legislative changes or media releases affecting the operation of superannuation funds once every 6.5 days on average. When will the madness end? The coalition has remained true to form and follows the example of its Labor predecessor by introducing, in last night's 1997&hyphen;98 budget, another raft of changes to the way in which superannuation will operate. For those in the industry who were hoping for a halt to the incredible pace of change to superannuation laws and regulations this must be a disappointing, if not predictable, response by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In general terms, the amendments suggested by the minor parties in the Senate and agreed to now by the government are worth while. But they will not alleviate compliance costs in the hands of the fund managers and the funds themselves or collection costs to the Commissioner of Taxation and, therefore, the revenue. They are worth while; the government has accepted them. However, all they really do is make a very unsavoury tax slightly more palatable.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will not surprise anyone to hear that the opposition will not be supporting this motion. The Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill will be better after these amendments than that which the government put to this House and which we thought review in the Senate would have rendered both fairer and more efficient. Many of the criticisms of the efficiency of the scheme outlined by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) are absolutely correct. I do not agree with all of the things he said, but his essential critique of the administrative complexity and the absurdity of the process 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3563"> through which the government has gone in dealing with this is absolutely correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that the bill, even after these amendments which do improve it, is simply not good enough. It is like the problem we confronted in this House with the workplace relations bill: the amendments in the Senate improved the bill but left it so profoundly inadequate in key ways that we could not support the motion. We find that again here. As it relates to superannuation, these amendments and the bill as a result of these amendments make absolutely clear&mdash;and, once again, the member for Curtin was correct about this&mdash;that this government has no fundamental understanding of superannuation at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was made crystal clear by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in question time today when he asserted, in response to a question by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), that to get the matching contribution from the government under the previous scheme workers making their own three per cent contributions would have to give up three per cent of their award wages to receive the matching contribution. That is just not true. In other circumstances one might have thought the Treasurer was seeking to mislead the House. But I am absolutely sure he was not; I am sure he just did not have a clue what he was talking about. And he is the minister responsible for superannuation. He just got it wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are wrong again on this, although eventually after nine months of pretending they have at least admitted it is a tax. They still came in and tried to say, `We are going to vote for it to be a tax but we really think it isn't.' That is taking the ridiculous to a new level of absurdity. The member for Curtin gave one reason that explained simply why it is a tax in terms of the nomenclature but, by any definition, a tax is a law that says, `Some money that otherwise is in your pocket has to go into the government's pocket.' That is what this is. Pass the law and the money transfers from you to the government, not in return for a particular service for which you are paying a fee but as a compulsory acquisition to the consolidated revenue fund. And 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is what this is. At least we will not have to put up with that humbug much longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not understand superannuation. All it understands is that it hates industry funds. This bill will seriously damage industry funds and the interests of many members who are ostensibly not the target of this legislation. That is where we get to the reason why the opposition will not be supporting these measures. It is funny that we get this incredulity. We said, in the Senate, we ought to have an inquiry into this legislation, but everybody in the House assumes&mdash;perhaps I have this naivety because I was in the Senate for a while and I have seen it happen&mdash;that you have an inquiry just for fun, that you will never change your point of view no matter what the evidence is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Actually, we listened to the evidence and it was overwhelmingly obvious that there were a number of problems with this bill that meant we could not support it, notwithstanding that we continued to be prepared to support the principle of higher tax on higher income people and their superannuation. If a bill came in that did that, and did not hit lower income earners and effectively miss the target of higher income earners and did not have the capacity still to hit retrenched workers like those in Newcastle, we would be prepared to support it, as we said in the House before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is so fundamentally flawed that low income earners who are not supposed to be the target will be paying this surcharge when you say they will not. They will. Most high income earners will be repackaging their incomes so they will avoid it. Most of the revenue will be coming from people who are not the target and too little of the revenue will be coming from those who are. That will be exacerbated by the extraordinary complexity of this proposal as you try to avoid making it a straightforward tax. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the amendments improve the circumstances for retrenched workers, they still leave them vulnerable. There will still be workers&mdash;for example, those retrenched in Newcastle or those thousands more who are going to be retrenched here in my electorate of Can 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3564"> berra&mdash;who will be liable to have this surcharge applied to them as a consequence of their redundancy. For example, the amendments exclude some forms of eligible termination payment but not employer eligible termination payments. The amendments exclude some forms of leave but not accrued leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These concerns mean that there is still the capacity for workers to get forced above the $70,000 cut&hyphen;off&mdash;and it will get worse and worse because the cut&hyphen;off line is not indexed&mdash;because they have had the misfortune to be retrenched. Do not come in here and preach piously that this is a bill designed to hit upper income earners. If you have a bill that does that and does not hit retrenched workers and does not have the unintended consequence of hitting the low paid, we will vote for it.</PARA>

But they were not passed. It is quite arguable that we should have said, `The bill is in an adequate form in the House, take it away,' but, firstly, we can count and, secondly, we felt that it was not impossible to develop amendments in the Senate to improve it. And we did develop those amendments, and we moved them in the Senate. But the government slunk off and did another one of its deals with the Democrats&mdash;and, to be fair, the amendments make the bill better but they still make it inadequate and unfair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do know that this is a bill that is going to have the unintended&mdash;we hope it is unintended&mdash;consequence of hitting many low income workers, and it is going to have an adverse effect on the superannuation of every one of them, even if they are not affected by the tax, for the reason, outlined by the member for Curtin, that it will force up the administrative costs of every industry superannuation fund&mdash;not as much as some of the changes you proposed last night, which are going to make it worse, but we will deal with those when they come in.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As indicated, the opposition will be opposing these amendments. I want to make two points which are significant as to why this superannuation legislation is back before us in the House with some amendments which, even though they make some improvements, still do not go far enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point is that we have finally got the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to fess up. He has been telling this country for nine months that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3565"> this so&hyphen;called surcharge is not a tax. Looking at us across the dispatch box, he has got those wafer-thin lips telling us, `No new taxes'&mdash;you heard him say it again last night: `This is the government with no new taxes'&mdash;and he has had this tax staring people down the barrel ever since he introduced it in the last budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a fraud. And he has been exposed. Until recently, he was even going to come into this House, or send his goons into the House, to persist with opposing the amendments because the Senate has now amended his piece of legislation to call it not the surcharge bill but the tax bill&mdash;what it should have been called all along but what these people have dishonestly and deceitfully tried to hide from the Australian public. It has taken him nine months to own up, and we know that there are more taxes in the current budget. By the time the next election comes around, you will be exposed for the frauds and deceivers that you are. That is the first point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to another point. The closure of the Newcastle steelworks has exposed a number of flaws in this government's approach to policy. First of all, it exposed the fact that there is no leadership by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He told Ray Martin that he was going out to Newcastle, but he still has not been there. He is in hiding. The Prime Minister said he was concerned about the people of Newcastle, but he has gone into hiding. He hid from his responsibilities to the BHP steel workers back in 1982 when he was Treasurer, and he is still hiding. Fifteen years is a long time to be hiding, but we will flush him out, because he has to stand up to some responsibility in this country. The Newcastle steelworks has exposed his lack of leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also exposed the fact that this is a government without an industry policy and a government with no commitment to the steel industry or to developing a steel industry policy. We have a situation in which this government will not lift a finger to save the jobs of the Newcastle workers but which will tax them on the way through. This legislation before the House taxes them. Therefore, we are opposing this bill because they should not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be taxed. We have got the hypocrisy of a government frontbench that last night paid its own members a rebate for savings but now hits Newcastle steel workers with a tax slug. Real concern for the battlers. And tomorrow, when they attend mass meetings to consider what further action they should take and are told of this duplicity, set of double standards and hypocrisy, they will love it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a circumstance whereby amendments in the Senate now actually exclude from the superannuation surcharge superannuation payouts which are combined and called an eligible termination payment. Those are excluded, as are any payments from a redundancy package&mdash;the things that give you four weeks pay for each year of service. What is not excluded yet by this legislation is any lump sum payment they get by way of accumulated long service leave, accumulated annual leave or accumulated sick leave. They get rolled into the income of steelworkers and get slugged with a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are prepared to exclude the superannuation payments, why will you not exclude these? More to the point, there is a thing that BHP has already put on the table for its steelworkers&mdash;a special employee eligible termination payout&mdash;which BHP has signalled it is prepared to pay to any worker who has been with them for more than five years. That, too, will be slugged. This is a tax on loyalty. This is a tax on people who have given their total working lives to BHP, and this miserable government is going to tax them. That is why we are opposing this particular piece of legislation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the Newcastle steelworkers who are affected&mdash;2,500 of them will be affected if BHP goes through with its threat&mdash;but also the 1,000 Qantas workers for whom this government has sat on its hands and done nothing to protect their jobs; the 22,500 Telstra workers who, because of their policies, are going to be put on the scrap heap over the next three years; and the further 16,500 public servants they announced in the budget the other day will go. These are all people who are going to be slugged on the way out. These are the people who have committed them

<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course the draftsman had to say that because a tax is a tax is a tax. It is not just a question of semantics&mdash;it is much more than that. The failure to call it a tax in the first place has resulted in this lavish, convoluted and ridiculous scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all would have received, I have no doubt, letters from various chartered accountants. I have one from a firm in my electorate which points out that just to communicate with the 15.7 million individual superannuation accounts is going to cost $30 million. It has also been estimated that the cost to the superannuation funds will be $100 million a year. They say that, while the government hopes to raise $450 million in revenue, it is going to be nowhere near that as a result of these administrative complexities which started because the government wanted to pull a swiftie. They were not prepared to own up and call a tax a tax and hence apply the proper collection and administrative procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that this now admitted tax is something which is going to give the government a windfall gain every time there is a round of retrenchments. Regrettably, we are going to see those more and more under this government because the government do not have an industry policy, unless you can call a doctrine of calculated neglect an industry policy. That is precisely and only what the government have in mind. They are fundamentalists saying, `If you have a small government, if you retreat and retract from involvement in industry, by some miraculous process of conception the economy is going to lift off.' While other countries are promoting their industries, somehow ours is going to have life divinely brought into it so that we are able to compete on their terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not happen. It is not the real world. We are already seeing that. The Newcastle steelworks is the most recent and dramatic instance of such a tragedy, but we are going to see many, many more of those, as the member for Hotham has pointed out. We are going to see it with Telstra and Qantas and, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> every time it occurs, the government is going to make a windfall gain at the expense of workers and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of those workers, particularly if they are in their 40s and beyond, have virtually my hope and Buckley's of getting another job&mdash;this is the only chance they have to provide some sort of stability for their family, to pay off the mortgage a little to get ahead so the family is not destitute as a result of the trauma of having their jobs obliterated. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) still has not answered whether they are going to have to pay for employment assistance or whether they are going to be entitled to free service from the Commonwealth Employment Service to help them find another job. He did not know and he still does not know. He still has not answered that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are all kinds of ridiculous things in this bill. For instance, we are trying to avoid a situation where, if a worker has not provided his tax file number, the Commissioner of Taxation has to write him two letters&mdash;the second letter has to be within three months of the first letter. It does not say what happens if it is three months and one day after the date of the first letter&mdash;presumably the process would have to start again or any tax collected would be invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Hotham said, while there is some advance in excluding eligible termination payments, that phrase itself has a lot of complexities. It certainly does not include accumulated long service leave, annual leave and sick leave. While that is being included in a retrenched worker's termination pay for the purpose of assessing this tax, there is no way that the Labor Party would support a bill such as this.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), who is at the table, has been very agitated throughout the consideration of these amendments. I think his performance throughout the consideration accurately reflects the vulnerability of his government on this issue. Why would the parliamentary secretary not be particularly agitated? He is from a very marginal seat and, just as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3568"> importantly, he is from a regional marginal electorate. He knows the impact of these bills on his electorate and he really fears them, and now he has to sit at the table and wear them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said throughout my speech on the second reading debate on this package of bills that any browse of the newspapers at that time indicated that these bills from the start have been a farce and they have only been going downhill since then. I think it is fair to say that anyone in this country who knows anything about tax and superannuation arrangements has condemned these bills from the beginning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary had a bit to say throughout the second reading debate about the fact that the opposition supported this package of bills. Of course, we did so reluctantly, but I think it is fair to say that we did the responsible thing. I am also happy to say that I am not too happy with that proposition because I think there are some faults in the basic principle behind this package of bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) tells us consistently that this is a package of bills for a new surcharge, which we now know is a tax, targeted at the big end of town. Yet, in my electorate of Hunter I have thousands of coalminers who, only because they might work under dangerous conditions, only because they get penalty rates for working unusual shifts, only because they often work in dirty conditions, earn more than $70,000 a year. But I could hardly describe them&mdash;to use the Prime Minister's term&mdash;as the big end of town. These are hardworking Australians who put in a hard day's work or night's work for just reward.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their assessable income down below the threshold level. As the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) has also indicated, the wonderful thing about these amendments is that not only now does Dennis Rose QC believe this is a tax, not only does the opposition believe this is tax, not only does the general Australian community recognise this is a tax, but now the Senate also recognises this is a tax. By accepting these amendments, the government now recognises that this is not a surcharge but a tax and, as a result, is a blatant breach of a very important pre-election commitment from this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we did the responsible thing. We supported the motion for the second reading of these bills. As I said, I think that was a responsible thing to do. But, while we did so, we pointed out the administrative burdens that were placed upon small business, the impost on low income earners who might fail to submit their tax file numbers to their fund managers and that the administrative costs of the fund would be borne not only by fund participants earning more than $70,000 a year but also by low income fund participants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real thing I want to talk about today&mdash;and the main reason I rose today to speak to these amendments&mdash;is those workers who will be retrenched from BHP. I asked the Prime Minister yesterday whether he is prepared to give them special consideration. `No,' he said, unequivocally. He gave us a bit of hot air first, but when pushed to answer the question he said, `No, they'll be treated like every other Australian worker.' That means that they will be whacked like every other low income earner in Australia. That is the result of this package of bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) has pointed out that the Senate amendments do improve the package of bills, but that they are far from amendments that are satisfactory to us. That is why the opposition has chosen to oppose them in this place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of extra issues to which I previously indicated I wish to refer&mdash;and I will deal with some of those in a moment. I simply want to make it very clear to the House&mdash;and some will not understand it, I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3569"> know, because there are a couple of big words here&mdash;that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), when he spoke for the opposition when the Superannuation Contribution Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill came forward initially, said that while the opposition did not oppose the principle of this legislation&mdash;and that, therefore, he would not be voting against the motion for the second reading&mdash;it was an unholy mess. We moved an amendment then which said that it should be withdrawn and redrafted to achieve its purpose. That was defeated by the government, which felt that it was fine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We moved the same amendment at the second reading stage in the Senate and said that the principle this bill was trying to achieve was okay but that it was a mess&mdash;exactly as the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) made clear. We said, `Take it away and come back with a bill that actually does what you purport it to do. Come back with a bill that does hit the upper income earners, whom you are going to miss, and doesn't hit the lower income earners, whom you are going to hit, and that does not create all the administrative mess, the constitutional uncertainty and the chaos in the superannuation system that this proposal will create.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you defeated that proposal in the Senate. Therefore, we are confronted with a different circumstance where we have to deal with the final consequence of your failure to get this bill in order. We have given you every chance to implement a principle we share, but you have failed. Therefore, the logical consequence is that we will not vote for this mess, even though we are still prepared to support any bill that comes in that actually implements the principle you announced in your budget&mdash;not what this bill does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what the bill does. It proposes a massive increase in compliance costs and procedures&mdash;from a government supposedly committed to lessening the burden of red tape on business. There will be extra red tape imposed by this bill than removed by any of the other measures you have proposed&mdash;and it will be worse with the meas 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ures you announced on budget night with regard to super. It will mean a reduction in the benefits of all members of superannuation funds because of the administrative costs of the surcharge. We have a complete alienation of the superannuation industry, and all the related professional advisers, accountants, financial advisers and actuaries tell you that this is a mess and that you should take it away and start again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are missing one thing that is fundamental to the fair application of this proposition, which you said you would get&mdash;the cooperation of the states and territories. No state has said that they will apply this absurd proposition to their public servants. Therefore, you are going to have an unfair application of this bill: certain people who meet every other criteria of the legislation will not be affected by it. Some upper income people will not be affected by this legislation because they work for state governments, and it cannot be applied to them in the messy way you have gone about doing it. You need the cooperation of the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the people in the state governments getting paid $150,000 to $200,000 a year are not going to pay this. But the workers getting retrenched in Newcastle and the workers getting retrenched here in my electorate are going to pay. You are surprised that we do not like it. You are surprised that we say, `You've got it so badly wrong we can't support even the worthwhile principle.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very hard to take a principle as reasonable as the one which you outline and come up with as botched an effort as this. It must have taken a lot of effort by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), because I know that many of the people who advise him are competent people. It must be another example of that arrogance he showed at question time today when he said, `We don't need any advice. We don't need the tax office to tell us how to run it. We can make a mess of it by ourselves.' And he has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is certainly going to have an awful consequence for the national savings objective the government purports to have. It is destroying faith in the superannuation industry, which we so desperately need to have in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3570"> creased.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to speak on the Senate amendments to the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997. I am told that Ben Chifley had a saying that if something looked like a duck, walked like a duck and was generally seen in the company of ducks, it was fair to assume it was a duck&mdash;and so it is with this superannuation contribution surcharge. The Senate has insisted that this surcharge is a tax. It is something that we in the opposition have said all along. The government has insisted that this is not a tax but a surcharge. If you wanted to strike the middle course, you could probably say it is a tax surcharge. The bill will now be a tax. Unequivocally, the surcharge is now defined within the bill as being a tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to note that when the government said, `You ought to be in favour of this surcharge because it is really hitting those people better able to pay,' we said, `No, you've got to be careful because, as the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and a number of other speakers have mentioned, the sacked steelworkers in Newcastle will be caught up in this legislation,' the government ignored it. As the member for Hunter said, even when he pleaded with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in question time to have some compassion for these workers, saying, `There has been such a massive loss of work in one city; try to see if we cannot make some exemption for them,' the answer was no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make the point that the government argue that they are really trying to target the top end of town. We have said that the top end of town is not being targeted; they are hitting ordinary people. When they bring in their great savings scheme, where is the targeting in that? The Prime Minister gets up and says, `I'm a big man; I'm not going to

The opposition had concerns about the retirement savings accounts. You will recall that this was the pay-off to the banking industry by the government. Today in question time, talking about superannuation, the Treasurer said, `Oh, you're opposed to competition in superannuation.' Ironically, this element that is supposed to introduce competition in superannuation is guaranteed by the government&mdash;in the minister's second reading speech and every other speech&mdash;to give workers lower superannuation returns.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have a lot of time but I want to say that this is really sad because over the years both sides of parliament have understood the absolute necessity to improve national savings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a government that claims to want to encourage savings, and made a big showpiece of that in last night's budget, yet the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997 which is before the House actually discourages savings. This is a measure which taxes savings and drives people out of superannuation. It is not a superannuation policy because this government is trying to discourage people taking out superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government introduced in last night's budget a so-called savings measure, but it is a benefit for the rich and a paltry amount, if anything at all, for the very poor in our community. Why is that? Because to get the benefit, you have to save. We all know that the vast majority of low income earners spend everything that they earn, through whatever means. They cannot save and, therefore, they cannot get this benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting that even for those who would have gone into superannuation, people on average weekly earnings paying the equivalent of $1,000 a year into superannuation would have, under Labor's previous policy, got matched dollar for dollar every one of those $1,000 put into superannuation. This was a promise this government said it would keep, but ratted on the Australian population last night. It has not kept it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now a person who puts $1,000 into superannuation only gets $150. That is a $850 slug&mdash;$850 taken away from the battlers of this country. Yet the people at the top end of town, including the Kerry Packers and politicians, get the maximum of $450. That is the reason this savings measure introduced in the budget last night costs $2 billion when fully 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> implemented versus their previous commitment to honour and match the co-payment. That would have cost them $4 billion. It is still going to cost $2 billion, but the weight of benefit will go to the top end of town. The people at the lower end of the scale get nothing or a very minimal amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today in question time the Treasurer (Mr Costello) tried to go through his theatrics&mdash;Mr Smug playing to the gallery and to the televisions, saying, `When in all of Labor's 13 years did it do anything to encourage savings?' The answer to that question is that we did it consistently over our 13 years. We made a commitment to lift national superannuation in this country from zero&mdash;because there were very few wage earners in this country in superannuation&mdash;to 15 per cent by the turn of this century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we left office, that target was between nine and 12 per cent&mdash;nine per cent for everyone; 12 per cent for those who had started to make their three per cent contribution. Our promise was, for all those making the three per cent contribution, we would match it. That is how we would have got to the 15 per cent. But the fact of the matter is the decision that was taken last night stops that dead in its tracks. It means that no-one will put in more than the nine per cent. It means that the move to superannuation and therefore genuine long-term savings in this country has stopped dead in its tracks. Treasury has said we will get a greater lift in national savings through Labor's superannuation plan than any tax concessions on saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality now is the government will knock off up to six per cent of the target of our strategy. The further reality is this nation will be stuck with a nine per cent contribution to superannuation until Labor is returned to power. This is not a government committed to encouraging genuine superannuation; this is a government committed to only the top end of town. It is not a government with a commitment to or compassion for the battlers. The piece of legislation before us is just another demonstration of that. For that reason we will oppose it and we will persist with our superannuation strategy, which was the right strategy.  </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time in this place I have encountered a bill that encompasses every single thing that is bad and wrong about those opposite. It encompasses stealth, dishonesty and a failure to recognise its own mistakes. For that reason, for me this bill is something unique&mdash;and, I would suggest, it is unique for others who have served much longer in this place. It is a blatant repudiation of a cast&hyphen;iron pre-election promise that no new taxes would be introduced. An unequivocal election promise put many times by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in a read my lips fashion, was that he would not introduce any new tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is an ongoing, highly unyielding refusal to openly admit a breach of this promise. Contrary to the Bell committee's recommendations, which have had and will have no impact at all on the small business persons whom I speak to on a regular basis in my electorate, this will increase rather than reduce procedural paperwork, compliance costs and general red tape. Contrary to government rhetoric, our proposals and amendments would not have burdened small business with masses of paperwork. Small business already has to report the date and amount of contributions for each and every employee as a result of government changes to the averaging of superannuation contributions in the 1996-97 budget. That rhetoric is clearly spurious and goes out the window.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also implicit in this bill is the non-cooperation of the states and territories. They have clearly refused to collect this tax&mdash;and obviously it is a tax. Another component of this bill which encompasses in one piece of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation all that is bad and wrong about this government is that the amount of revenue estimated to be collected will in fact not be collected from those at whom the new tax is primarily aimed. Furthermore, the government's complete and utter lack of commitment to national savings borne out by this proposal makes its national savings objective pale into insignificance compared with our commitment to this worthy objective. What message does this bill send to individuals who are doing the right thing and saving for their retirement or to, more particularly, those individuals whom we are trying to encourage to save and take their superannuation as a pension? This government will tax them at a phenomenal level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also mourn BHP workers in Newcastle, and this legislation does nothing to help their plight. This government has done nothing to save the jobs of those in Newcastle. It has no industry policy. The Prime Minister, contrary to his undertaking, has refused to visit Newcastle. This bill will slug them with a tax as they hit the canvas, having suffered what could only be described as a knockout blow from this government, which could best be described as having fiddled while BHP burned. It is for those workers in particular that I mourn and on whose behalf I express great concern.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Superannuation, to the individuals who contribute to it, is an extremely important lifeline for their retirement days. Any government that starts changing superannuation laws needs to be very cautious that it does not disadvantage people who have, for many years, contributed under one set of rules only to discover in later life the ground rules have changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, from a national perspective, superannuation provides the basis for national savings and, under the former Labor government's formula, was for the first time establishing an onshore base of capital that enabled Australian industry to access large sums of money here, Australian dollars, rather than their being forced, as they basically have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3573"> been since the First Fleet arrived, to draw capital from overseas. All of that has been put asunder by this government's actions in its approach to national savings, in particular superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the couple of minutes available to me today, I want to draw attention to some of those impacts of this legislation which the government has ignored and which many people who are going to bear the brunt of these changes are sadly not yet familiar with. In the defence forces there are a number of people who receive not simply the base salary but a range of allowances in addition to that base salary. Indeed, most members in the services would receive some additional allowance, whether it be for the period of time they are on exercises and camping or because of the nature of the unit to which they are attached. For example, those that are involved in parachute units would receive about $1,600 a year on top of whatever other benefits they may get on top of whatever other allowances they may get. Those payments that those defence personnel receive do not contribute to their superannuation benefit at the end of their service. They are not used in calculating the superannuation benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, under the government's legislation, you will count that income for the purposes of determining whether or not they have gone over the threshold and will have to bear the brunt of your superannuation surcharge tax. So they get no superannuation benefit from that income, but they get the penalty you are imposing on them in this legislation. But, worse than that, in an act of absolute personnel management lunacy, your government is out there at the moment trying to retain highly skilled people&mdash;particularly in the air force, in areas such as key pilot positions and air traffic controllers&mdash;offering them a retention bonus, offering them $20,000 or $40,000 to sign up for another period of time because we need their skills. And we do need their skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what you have not told them is that every single one of them who signs will incur your new superannuation tax on their benefits at the end of the day. You will push every single one of them into a new tax bracket on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their superannuation. Put that in the brochure you send them and see how many of them want to take up the offer. At least be honest with the defence personnel in Australia and tell them, when you offer them the retention bonus, what you are going to do with the other hand, because most of them do not know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have actually been to a few bases and I have told a few of the people there. You should see the look in their eyes. You should see the attitude and the response not just from one but from a whole host of air force officers I have spoken to in the last two months where I have raised this issue with them. They cannot believe it. They cannot believe the government, their employer, would be so stupid and so underhanded to say to them, `You are so valuable that we want you to stay in the service,' and at the same time strip away from them, without telling them, the superannuation benefits they are going to get at the end of the day because you are going to slug them with this new tax. It is not only abhorrent in terms of personal savings; defence personnel are being duped knowingly by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time for people on the other side to actually come clean with that. It is time for people on the other side of the parliament to now explain to the service personnel why they think service personnel should pay extra taxes because they are willing to do what the government has asked them to do. They are willing to give a commitment to you and this nation to serve for another five years or seven years. In return for giving you that commitment, you are going to slug them with another tax. The worst part about this is that we moved an amendment in the Senate to fix this problem and you defeated it. You consciously defeated it so that they would be slugged with that tax. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a few remaining points I want to make. Up until now we have spoken about the areas that are covered by these amendments and why, welcome as they are, they do not go far enough. The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) has led me to the last points I want to make, which relate to those areas that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3574"> these amendments do not even address. I will not traverse again the points that he made so adequately about the problem as it relates to defence force personnel which was dealt with in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we try to analyse this legislation, we see that there is a very interesting question to be asked. The government claims this is a great piece of legislation. We have continually sought the actuarial report which was commissioned by the government into the operation of this new tax, but we cannot get it. As the Western Australia Liberal finance minister, Mr Evans, said, there must be some very adverse comments in that report. But it is going to stay a secret document in this open government! Another part of the charter of budget honesty hits the wall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me have a look at the amendments we moved that were defeated, that are not picked up by these eight and that are a cause of concern, and I will do so briefly. There is the fact that there is a proposal for advance payment&mdash;just a revenue grab; nothing to do with any of the merits in this. Many of the people adversely affected by this legislation who are not its target will in fact be slugged with a 22.5 per cent tax in the first year. There is the threshold issue which we have spoken about. There are the changes to the adjustable taxable income definition which I have spoken about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are serious problems about vesting with this legislation which we sought to correct. But you are going to leave the situation where people could still be taxed on money they never get. It is not very hard to fix and it is not big money, but you refuse to fix it. We could not convince the Australian Democrats of the merit of this; it was not part of the deal. So, unfortunately, I think those people are going to be hit. We have got some serious problems still about what happens with some of the defined benefit schemes and the amendments we moved, which would have ensured that they were affected only as intended, to the maximum of 15 per cent; but that is not going to be caught up either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two areas of concern to me that I want to just mention, because I think the principles are quite important. One is that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> everybody acknowledges&mdash;even the advocates of the legislation&mdash;that some people are going to get caught up, at least temporarily, having to pay. Then ultimately they will get their money back. But they are not going to get any interest on the money. So that is an effective tax. They will lose the use of their money&mdash;we are not quite sure for how long; up to a year, perhaps&mdash;and they will not get any interest on that money; the government will. So they are paying a tax when everybody knows they are not eligible. Even after they prove they are not liable, they will not get back the full value of the money that has been taken from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That money should have been in the superannuation fund of those workers for a year. This government is taking it, using it for a year and not recognising the loss of interest. There is no argument that it is a severe penalty on people who are not eligible. It is imposed on them after they have proved they are not liable. This is a very unfair measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a question of principle: the actuarial guidelines will determine the formula which will determine the tax liability of many hundreds of thousands of Australians, but will not be a disallowable instrument in the parliament. In a democracy, only the parliament should set the circumstances in which the citizen has obligations to pay money to the state. Even if you accept that everything else about the bill is right, how can you justify saying that the guidelines that affect the tax liability of Australians are not subject to review by the parliament? This is unique and wrong. Senator Harradine spoke eloquently about it in the Senate, and he was right: it does not cost you a cracker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a question of whether you get your revenue or not. It is a question of whether you act with principle in the way in which citizens' tax obligations are determined. Is the parliament the final arbiter of the citizens' obligation to the state? I always thought the answer was yes. If we pass this motion today, for the first time, the answer will be no. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The Senate's requested amendments Nos (3) and (4) to the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge Imposition Bill 1997 require the Commissioner of Taxation to take all reasonable steps to obtain a member's tax file number before imposing the surcharge where a member has failed to quote a tax file number and their surchargeable contributions are below $2,000. Further, existing members of superannuation funds at 7 May 1997 with contributions under $2,000 have a nil rate of surcharge imposed, even if they fail to quote their tax file number. Members who join a fund on or after 7 May 1997 will have the surcharge imposed at 15 per cent but are entitled to an amendment if they subsequently quote their tax file number. This supports the policy that low or middle income earners do not need to pay the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senate requested amendment No. (5) ensures that the $2,000 surchargeable contributions threshold in cases of non&hyphen;quotation of a tax file number is indexed in line with other indexed amounts under the surcharge legislation.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3577"> Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), I am going to speak on the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge Imposition Bill 1997 and it will be the opposition's comments on all the subsequent bills that will come before us. I will not be getting up and speaking on any of the others because, in effect, we had the debate on all the bills in the debate on the first bill. We all appreciated the tolerance of the chair in allowing us to range across all the bills. I am sure that that tolerance will speed up the overall process, even though it lengthened the consideration of the first bill slightly. So this will be the only other contribution we will make and we will not be dividing any further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), with whom I have discussed this, I know would have welcomed the opportunity, having voted with the government on those amendments, to actually vote against the bill because, although he supported the amendments, as we did, in so far as they moderately improved the bill, they did not leave the bill as adequate to reflect his concerns, but there is no procedural device available for that to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to make clear that our views on these subsequent bills are the same in principle as those to the first bill, that is, while we accept that the amendments improve the bill, they still leave all the bills inequitable and unjust. This bill in particular attempts very inadequately to address the fundamental question that we raised in the Senate in respect of our amendments that would have effectively excluded low to middle income employees from paying the surcharge. This attempt creates a very artificial distinction between prior to 7 May and post 7 May 1997 accounts and lots of middle to low income earners are going to be caught. It seems to me to be an exceedingly complex and entirely unfair arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you have is people in the same circumstances paying different rates of tax. That is not a good principle. In fact, it breaches all the fundamentally sound tax principles that I have dealt with in debating tax bills in the parliament over the last decade or so. We accept that that is the majority view of both houses and we will not take the time of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> House just to reiterate known and already articulated positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a source of serious concern to us. We will continue to talk about it in the community, we will continue to make clear in Newcastle, we will continue to make clear in Geelong and in all the regional cities being hit by the redundancies that are going to flow from the decisions made in the last budget that those workers are going to be affected by these bills. In discussion with the workers throughout the country, we will make it clear that many of them will be unfairly and unreasonably affected by what we hope is the unintended consequences of these bills and affected by what the government declares are the unintended consequences of these bills. I would hate to think that they were actually a deliberate misleading of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, the outcome is that people who were told that this legislation would not affect them will pay the cost and many of the people who are its target will not. This is a failed attempt to implement a principle that we could have supported. We will vote against all these bills because the amendments do not solve our core problems, but we will not be speaking on any of the others and we will not be dividing any further.</PARA>

Amendment No. 3 ensures that the surcharge does not apply to termination payments made by an employer that include an eligible termination payment made from an employee share acquisition scheme. This achieves a commitment by the government to leave the status of these payments unchanged and removes concerns that the surcharge may have retrospective application to amounts accumulated in employee share acquisition schemes prior to 20 August 1996.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On behalf of the government, I would like to thank those on the other side of this House who I understand wished to speak on this bill for their contributions to the amendments that have come back from the upper house and also for their consideration to make sure that these bills do go through the parliament tonight, as they are already two budgets old. I do appreciate the earlier comments of the opposition spokesman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate amendment to clause 38 in relation to this bill clarifies the policy objective of the regulation&hyphen;making power which enables regulations to be made about RSA fees and charges; that is, the amendment will ensure that the power to regulate retirement savings accounts, fees and charges is for the purpose of ensuring that the objective of a low cost product is met. The amendment was supported by the government because it is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3581"> consistent with the government's overall policy intention for retirement savings accounts, which is to provide a simple, low cost, convenient product that complements existing superannuation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further amendments that the Senate made to this bill inserted a new clause, clause 51A, and amended clauses 52 and 55 to ensure employees are given a choice before they are signed up to retirement savings accounts by employers. So, before an employer signs up an employee to a retirement savings account, they must give him or her application forms for four different superannuation vehicles: namely, the retirement savings account, the retirement savings account with an institution that is accepting the employee's salary, an industry based superannuation fund that the employee is eligible to join and, finally, another regulated superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For new employees, the employer will be able to open a retirement savings account for the employee where that employee positively opts for the retirement savings account within 28 days or fails to make any choice within that period. For existing employees&mdash;that is, those in respect of whom the employer is already making contributions to a fund&mdash;the employer will only be able to open a retirement savings account where the employee positively opts for the retirement savings account within 28 days. Further, if the employee is silent, the employer must continue to contribute to the employee's existing fund. The government supports this amendment because it is broadly consistent with our policy of promoting greater member choice of fund and competition in the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the various clauses on improper conduct in the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill, the Senate amendments to clauses 68 and 73, and the new 76A, will prevent retirement savings account providers from offering inducements to employers on the condition that they sign up their employees to retirement savings accounts. The government supports this amendment because it will prevent retirement savings account 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> providers from unfairly using their economic power vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis the employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate has removed the due diligence defence for retirement savings account providers who are subject to civil action for false or misleading conduct. This was set out in clause 168 of the bill, which relates to relief from civil liability. The due diligence defence provides a shield against civil liability where the false and misleading statement is due to such causes as a reasonable mistake or reasonable reliance on information supplied by another person. In effect, this provides a shield against innocent mistakes where due diligence was exercised to avoid the contravention. Similar defences are commonly used in other legislation, such as the Corporations Law and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government supports the amendment as a means of securing passage of the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill and meeting its election promise. However, government support for this amendment should not be taken as general support for the removal of due diligence defences from conduct and disclosure requirements in the financial sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government notes that the final report of the financial system inquiry&mdash;the Wallis report&mdash;affirmed the need for due diligence defences in relation to positive disclosure requirements. Notwithstanding our support for this Senate amendment, the government reserves its position on the general desirability of these defences, for consideration in the context of our response to the Wallis report.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another product of a government&hyphen;Democrat deal, and we will not be supporting any of these bills relating to the retirement savings accounts, although I will only be speaking once and we will not be dividing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and the Democrats did a deal on the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill. The Senate had deliberated on the legislation and voted it down. They defeated the third reading. That is a similar situation to the debate we had before. Right up to the end, we were prepared to give the government a chance to try to get this proposal right. But they did not get it right and, therefore, we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3582"> sought to defeat it and, in the first instance, we succeeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as is the case in such matters these days, the government and the Democrats went away and came to an agreement and, once again, to be fair, it is an agreement that improves the bill. Because of the amendments, it is a better bill than it was before them. But it is not good enough to warrant the support of this House, and it is certainly not good enough for the Labor Party&mdash;the opposition&mdash;because our view is that the interests of working Australians and their superannuation are not adequately protected and the basic, very important structure of the Australian superannuation system&mdash;which has been developed over the last decade with such a lot of effort and over such a lot of resistance from those who are now the government&mdash;is too important to be played with like this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the government in general&mdash;and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in particular&mdash;hate industry superannuation funds. They call them `trade union funds'. They cannot find the conspiracy, but they know there is one in there somewhere. They are like bloodhounds chasing it. In 10 years, they still have not found it, but they know it is there. And they will not stop until they find it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it really means is that trade unions have no right to be involved in the management of the nation's finances. They do not control them entirely. They just participate. I get a lot of complaints from employer organisations about the government calling these things trade union funds. I know people who run important industry funds&mdash;employer representatives who chair these funds&mdash;and they do not enjoy having their funds called `trade union funds', because their employer members contribute, share in the responsibility for these funds and choose the trustees for these funds. But the government hate them, and they will continue to seek to undermine them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that the biggest net contributors to the coalition in the last election campaign were the banks. So two and two, in this instance, quite clearly make four, and that is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what we have got in front of us here today&mdash;the outcome of those factors and nothing else. It does nothing to enhance superannuation. No Australian worker will get one extra dollar of superannuation as a result of this change. In fact, out of all the changes that have been made by the government to superannuation&mdash;at the cost to the credibility of the superannuation system that the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) spoke of in the last debate&mdash;not one extra dollar of superannuation will flow as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody knows&mdash;even its advocates&mdash;that retirement savings accounts are a low return product. Then why are we advocating them? What is the point? We are saying, `What we want is for you to have less. It is a great reform.' And it is under the heading of choice. I will come back to the detail of the choice in a moment, but it is a pretty rum old choice to say, `What you are being offered is a guaranteed low return product.' It ought to have a warning on it like the health warning on a cigarette packet&mdash;`Be warned this is a low return product'&mdash;before you sign up for it. So that is one of the areas of profound concern to us. The Senate killed these bills, and that is what deserved to happen to them but, as a result of this deal, we have them back before us. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us go to the detail of our concern, beyond that low return, its unfair impact on workers and its failure to deliver one extra dollar&mdash;for all this pain, there is not one extra dollar of national savings or superannuation. Beyond that, why are we doing it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is a very different product from the one promised during the March election campaign. We accept that the government said, before the election, that they would give this return to their banking supporters, and they are delivering. But they are delivering a very different product. It is no good anyone pretending that is not the case because, in the Senate, we were able to table the cabinet document to prove it, so it is not exactly a big secret any more. This is a different document and a lesser one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very concerned about the issue of fees and charges and their application to these products. You would have to say overall that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3583"> the history of banks with fees and charges does not give the Australian people confidence that leaving the banks to set fees and charges on workers' superannuation, on what is already a low return product, is going to take care of the interests of the millions of Australian workers whose superannuation we are putting in jeopardy by these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned that portability and transfer of moneys has not been addressed in the government and Democrats amendments. It is central to the government's election promise of providing a low cost, portable account for superannuation. It has not been addressed, and these amendments are inadequate for that reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are getting, for the first time for superannuation, are products with no trustee structure to underpin them. It has been the core of the security of workers' money&mdash;the onerous duties on trustees. When we were in government, we were frustrated by the way trustees were so cautious and so conservative. But that is a proper function. I sometimes might have wished that they made different decisions, but they are very careful in their proper protection of the concerns of the members whom they represent, and they deliver good results for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are making the first significant step away from the trustee structure, which has been a feature of contemporary Australian superannuation and in which Australian workers have confidence. We are finding that we want to increase national saving but we are undermining the confidence of the contributors to the most important element of our savings arrangement&mdash;the national superannuation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similar products have been offered in the United Kingdom and experience shows that they failed. In fact, I predict that one of the first things that the Blair government will have to do is fix the pensions mess that resulted from the then government, on the same ideological binge, encouraging individuals to take out bank superannuation products. It is a mess. People's retirement savings are in jeopardy, and the Blair government will have to fix it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret to say that that British precedent will be emulated here. The Thatcher government had similar bank superannuation products, and they were disasters.</PARA>

You are repeating the tragic mistakes of England that will have to be fixed. Lots and lots of workers' money in England is in jeopardy as a consequence, and I am seriously concerned it is going to happen here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over and above that, the fundamental and primary concern goes to the question of inadequate consumer protection. Of all the concerns, this is the most serious. We are very concerned that employees do not have adequate protection against being coerced into these products. The government&hyphen;Democrats deal does not adequately deal with the fundamental issue of third&hyphen;line forcing. We know that banks already have large numbers of sales personnel ready to go out to say to employers, `We will offer you discounted interest rates on your other loans from us if your employees take out retirement savings accounts with us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That process, so-called third&hyphen;line forcing, should be illegal. It should not be possible under this legislation for that to take place. We are concerned that the government&hyphen;Democrats deal does not adequately deal with third&hyphen;line forcing. We are fundamentally concerned.

This will reduce the administrative burdens and enhance efficiency for employers, particularly small business proprietors who open retirement savings accounts on behalf of their employees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has not been explained why an 1890s political structure&mdash;a convention&mdash;is thought to be appropriate for the 1990s. The conventions of the 1890s filled a political vacuum which no longer exists. Clause 6 of the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill accepts the constitutional convention as a given. It does not explain its necessity nor its functions, only the methods for its election. If we had to define the existing system, `de facto republic' would be far more accurate than `constitutional monarchy'. As for the monarchy, or the monarch, where is it, or are they in our present system?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed convention is both tainted&mdash;the method of election or selection virtually guarantees its failure&mdash;and unnecessary. The tainting, of course, is deliberate. If there is a low percentage of votes cast, if people find the obstacle race too much for them, and there is only a narrow majority for the republic, the argument for change can be discredited and disregarded. If there is a stacked deck through appointed delegates and the convention then goes against the republic, or if the convention is divided or cannot reach any agreement on the major issues, reform can be delayed interminably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1890s, conventions were needed because there were no federal institutions. In 1891, the members were appointed. All were serving colonial MPs, including premiers, from the six colonies and also there were three representatives from New Zealand. In the 1897&hyphen;98 convention, which the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) remembers so well&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. In 1897&hyphen;98, five colonies each elected 10 members. Queensland did not take part. All of the 50 members elected were past or serving politicians. Edmund Barton, for example, was temporarily out of the New South Wales parliament in 1897. The most significant non-political candidate, Patrick, Cardinal Moran, the Archbishop of Sydney, failed to win, although probably supported by the Right of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the New South Wales Labor Party at that stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An 1897 Sydney street directory would be an interesting artefact to have, especially if in mint condition, but not of much value in helping people find their way around. The harbour, Parramatta and Kirribilli House would be there, but there would be no bridge, airport or University of New South Wales. It would not really represent Sydney as we all know it. An 1897 Canberra directory would be even more useless. So with the constitution. The US still applies its constitution, operative in 1790, as written. We do not. One alternative might be to publish an annotated edition of our constitution with marginal notations against many sections which read, `Disregard this section,' or `This section has never been implemented.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1890s, there was no nation called Australia or even Australasia; it was a geographical term or a concept, not an entity. There was no national parliament, no body which could speak for the continent. There was no national political leadership. Completely new structures, including a constitution, had to be created. The leaders of the six diverse and distant colonies had zero years of experience with federation and a very shaky and remote knowledge of federal systems such as the US and Canada which they derived from the textbooks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Incidentally, the 1901 constitution has no provision for setting up a convention as part of the process of changing it. The original convention members did not aim for self-perpetuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1990s, Australia is a de facto republic already and has been at least, I would think, since 1942. There is a strong and growing Australian national sentiment. The Australian parliamentary system generally works well and votes give mandates to governments at elections. There is a national political constituency, quite distinct from that of each state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes proposed by the Keating government were symbolically significant but structurally minor, converting a de facto republic, which we are already, into a de jure or legitimate one. No new structures would be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3586"> created. One innovation that could be proposed is we might even go so far as to recognise the constitutional existence of a prime minister and cabinet, which the present constitution is completely silent about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have now had 96 years of experiencing the strengths and weaknesses of the federal system. The 1901 constitution was a very unsatisfactory document. Of its 128 sections, I estimate that 32 are irrelevant, anachronistic or purely transitional. I would invite the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), all of whom describe the `existing system' as perfect, to read aloud in here, on television or on radio chapter II of the constitution, `The executive government', and then say two things: firstly, `That's an accurate description of the way the system works now,' and, secondly, `I would not change a word.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be very unselfish of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister to show their commitment to chapter II because they would then have to give up their titles. The challenge can be safely made. They will never do it. Chapter II actually describes a top down, divine right monarchy with all powers in the hands of the Queen. Of course, it is all fairyland now. It was fairyland even in 1901. But do we have to maintain a constitutional commitment to fairyland into the 21st century?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best that can be said about chapter II is that it does not mean what it says. But some latter&hyphen;day conservatives say that we cannot change it either. The founding fathers in 1901 had the good sense to disregard the constitution as written. There is an unbridgeable gap between the big C `Constitution' and small c `convention'. My argument is that small c `convention' ought to be incorporated in the big C `Constitution'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have we learnt nothing from 96 years of Federation? Apparently not, say the fearful, the timid and the cynical. Our leaders talk about the constitution but give no evidence that they have read it. In this debate, it is amazing how few speakers have actually referred to it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Yet this is what the debate is all about. I suspect many of them think the existing system is in the constitution. I have news for them: it is not. Submissions to the Senate committee suggest an alarming range and deep confusion. Part of the transcript of the Prime Minister's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>  interview with Ray Martin in early February reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have to get it right. There is no such thing as a practice republic. We have a very stable system at the present time and if we are to change it must be absolutely certain that the system to which we are changing it is as good or if not better.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My plea to the Australian people is that this issue be not divisive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister's remarks in an interview with Laurie Oakes on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS>  program on 9 February illustrated a central confusion in the debate about the republic. He said `if anyone wants to change the system' then there would have to be extensive discussion and consultation until `an alternative model' emerged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But who wants to change the system? Nobody is proposing an alternative model&mdash;not him, not me, not even Paul Keating. I would settle for changing the document to accurately describe the system. My argument is that the preferred model&mdash;the system, as it is often called&mdash;is there already and working well. It is the 1901 constitution that is out of sync.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same interview with Laurie Oakes, the Prime Minister referred to the Governor-General as `our de facto head of state'. But Laurie Oakes could have followed that up and said, `Well, Prime Minister, you might describe yourself as the de facto head of government or the de facto Prime Minister,' because under the constitution that is precisely what he is. The office of Prime Minister does not exist as such in our current constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Prime Minister's status ought to be consolidated&mdash;and the Governor-General's, too&mdash;and, instead of having a de facto relationship with the Australian community, it ought to be the real thing, a de jure one. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3587"> Prime Minister could provide national leadership and end the existing confusion if he proposed the following question, or some variant of it, to the convention and then to the people, preferably first to an indicative, non-binding plebiscite to assess the level of popular support&mdash;something along the lines of the indicative plebiscite that was held on the national song back in 1977 during the prime ministership of Malcolm Fraser. My preference would be for a referendum question which read along these lines:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you favour an amendment of the Commonwealth constitution to entrench existing practice in which:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) the head of state is an indirectly selected person and does not exercise executive power;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) the House of Representatives, operating under the Westminster convention, determines after a general election which party or group of parties has a mandate to govern; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) a Prime Minister and cabinet exercise executive power?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe that is the question that we ought to be putting. I think Paul Keating inadvertently created a false expectation about what changing to a republic would mean. I fear that the Prime Minister's response creates a false antithesis. I am not aware of any responsible republican who advocates changing the system. The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) last night mournfully declared that he did not want Australia to adopt the US model. Well, he is not Robinson Crusoe in that. Could he provide the House with the name and address of anyone proposing this course? I have never heard it suggested in the course of the last three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The central fallacy is to assume that changing the constitution equals changing the system. It could be said that the reverse is the case. Would any of us recommend that students should read the constitution as it now stands to help them understand how our system actually works?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by making this point: our great grandfathers&mdash;it was only in Western Australia and South Australia that our great grandmothers might have been involved&mdash;were capable of making judgments on a wide variety of subjects in a federal system of which they had no direct experience or know 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ledge, just a very hazy understanding of what might have happened in the United States or Canada. Is it suggested that, after 96 years of working within the federal system, with an infinitely better educated electorate, our judgment would be inferior, that we would muck it up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most distressing thing about the nature of the debate is the kind of fatalism that seems to infect some members to say that we are not up to it, that if we attempted to do it, if we attempted to reach important decisions on critical matters, we would muck it up and damage the Commonwealth. We ought to have the same courage that our ancestors had a century ago. They had the guts to go ahead and make very major decisions where there was admittedly an element of risk.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the last remaining Privy Councillor in this place, it seemed to me appropriate that I might say a few words on this particular subject. I think, first of all, one should say that constitutional change has never been an easy subject. Of the 42 referenda that have been conducted, there have been so few that have been passed&mdash;some eight, as I recall. Constitutional change has, in the past, often dwelt on the same subject with an equal lack of success. For example, those referenda that suggested that the election for the members of the House of Representatives and the Senate should be conducted at the same time were put to the people on four occasions and defeated on four occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I wanted to do in opening was to first divert a little from the convention itself and say to a number of countries in our region to whom we are trying to encourage an understanding of democratic processes that it is a pity they find it so difficult to introduce into their systems the sort of particular election process without difficulty that has been put before the parliament in this bill, the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997. It does not mean that the process is not without some contention or without some difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, in Hong Kong, those of us who are involved and interested are concerned that there should be a provisional legislative 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3588"> council. Essentially there is now no electoral law to elect a new electoral council within that former independent territory that will become part of China on 1 July. I commend to Tung Chee&hyphen;hwa and those who are members of the provisional legislature an examination of the electoral processes of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, in Cambodia, I am one of those most concerned that there is no electoral law in place to allow the conduct of their second democratic election. Yet it is quite critical that it be held. That is a diversion, but it is important because in this place, for all the differences between us and some of the nuances of this legislation, we can devise  electoral laws which, having passed the parliament, we will all accept. It might well be that each of us would see processes that we would like different, whether it should be a voluntary election or a compulsory election or whether the postal voting system is applicable or not, but the point is that it is an effective and democratic process. I would say to both those countries that I would hope that they can look at what we are doing and perhaps see that it is not all that difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the legislation itself, I first want to say a few words about the process and then comment on some of the aspects of the convention. On the process, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who has just spoken, quite properly looked at the historical process of change. In my own electorate in Tenterfield the first of the constitutional conventions was held in the 1890s. The remarkable degree to which that 1885 federal Australian council was able to generate processes whereby there seemed in the 1890s to be greater capacity for dialogue between state premiers than now exists is something that I think might well be reflected on occasionally by those who attend COAG meetings who find it easier to find fundamental differences in their attitude than in those days long since where, for all its defects, they were finally able to come up through their own dialogue with a process of change. That to me is the most important part of our constitution.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it was passed by an act of the House of Westminster, it was an Australian constitution, with advice and consultation, but drawn more heavily from the United States constitution than from the unwritten constitution of the United Kingdom. I think it is important as we look at change in the 1990s towards 2001 that we understand that it is possible to look at change without fearing that change itself is a bad thing. I say that having started off talking about some of the referenda and the difficulties that have been involved in constitutional change. I think I remain the only member of this chamber who has attended each one of the modern constitutional conventions since they were first constituted by Gough Whitlam in 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point about those constitutional conventions, as the honourable member for Lalor has just suggested, is there is a large degree of unanimity in terms of the modernisation, if you will, of the constitution&mdash;eliminating certainly the anachronistic provisions within the constitution and making the constitution so that those provisions that are now relevant are there and deleting those that are no longer relevant. I think it is a pity that this constitutional convention, dealing as it is required only with whether or not Australia should become a republic, cannot perhaps advance constitutional change to the point of at least accepting the deletion of those anachronistic provisions. Once you move beyond that, there are difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with a number of other members of this place, I was privy to&mdash;I know it is something a number of us have been involved in&mdash;the production of a very good report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Constitutional change</EMPHASIS> by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of this place. Those who are interested in changing the constitution would do well to refer to it, not because it has any particular preference in the forms of change but because it has identified all the debates and all the product of recommendations. It allows in an annotated version reference to each section of the constitution to see where either there has been a referendum or there has been a recommendation for change and to understand as a result where we are in terms of what seems to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3589"> me across quite a lot of the constitution considerable unanimity that a number of the sections should be modified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So my first and fairly significant argument would be that I think it is a pity that we cannot look at something beyond just the republic in this convention and see whether we can come to an argument on the minimalist approach, if you wish to call it that, for at least removing those anachronistic provisions of the constitution. I say that having in mind that, if you can come to an agreement on that, it might help to remove part of the opposition that exists within the essentially conservative Australian electorate to the process of change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member for Lalor has just suggested, there is really nothing sacred about our constitution. It is not like Moses tablets handed down from Mount Sinai. It is a living, functional document which still provides the basis for our government legislative process. But people forget in the separation of power debate that it also constitutes the High Court. It not only sets the role of those of us who are within the legislature or identifies the role of the administration but also identifies the role and responsibilities of the High Court. That is an important part of why it is very much a living document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as the High Court, often amidst considerable controversy, has reached decisions which we feel intrude into our legislative process, we need to be aware that if we are going to change the constitution there is no reason why we should not intrude, if we wish, into their particular part of the legislation&mdash;in other words, the role and identity of the courts. Indeed, it has already been extended by statute&mdash;the fact that we now have Federal Courts and the fact that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is now considering a federal magistracy. These are all worthwhile extensions, not referred to in the constitution because the High Court has a separate role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see no reason why we should not, therefore, look at constitutional change. In doing that, I would hope for at least something beyond just that minimalist question and that we look towards those areas where everybody accepts there needs to be change. I think that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would help in the process of accepting the concept of change apart from the particular questions involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I want to refer to two aspects of the constitution about the role and responsibilities of the head of state. I mentioned in opening that as a Privy Councillor I am unique in this place. In days gone by all senior ministers and people like the late Arthur Calwell were members of the Privy Council. Arthur, in fact, was not at that time a minister. He was an `Hon.' because he had been a former minister under successive Labor administrations but was made a member of the Privy Council while Leader of the Opposition in this place, the point being that at that stage the Privy Council had both a legal division and an administrative division. People like Tony Blair, the recently elected Prime Minister of Britain, was a Privy Councillor before he became Prime Minister. They were members of the Privy Council because of the important function of members of the executive of advising the head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member for Lalor suggested, the head of state in Australia, while nominally the Queen, is in fact the Governor-General. The way sections 1 and 2 of the constitution work is that, while section 1 states `The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament'&mdash;and that is defined as consisting of the Queen, a Senate and a House of Representatives&mdash;section 2 immediately defines, in the form that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has defined as a monarchical republic, the Governor-General's designated responsibilities. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Governor-General appointed by the Queen&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which is in fact the only executive office now exercised by the monarch&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">shall be Her Majesty's representative in the Commonwealth, and shall have and may exercise in the Commonwealth during the Queen's pleasure, but subject to this Constitution, such powers and functions of the Queen as Her Majesty may be pleased to assign to him.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Without going into the nuance of that because I am rapidly running out of time, I think it is important we understand that the only role of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3590"> the monarch is that conferred by section 2 where it states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to debate that with you on another occasion; unfortunately, with 7&half; minutes left, I have no time. Section 64 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Governor-General may appoint officers to administer such departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor&hyphen;General in Council may establish.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think it is important to understand that the executive role of the head of state in Australia is in fact in chapter II. The point I want to make is that when people talk about the head of state they need to understand, not particularly as far as their own constitution is concerned but for the way in which our system works, that the executive function of government is in fact exercised by the Governor-General in consultation with ministers. We tend to think in this place, when we pass laws or when appointments are announced or policies promulgated, that this is where those things are in fact done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But neither federally nor in the states or territories are they in fact done in this place. They go from here and, either through the Executive Council or by signature of the Governor-General&mdash;or in the case of the states the state governors&mdash;are then promulgated into law, appointments are made and dismissals or resignations accepted. And there is indeed another process which is almost outside the light of day, which is the advice of and relationship between each of the continuing members of the Executive Council and the Governor-General as far as Australia is concerned. It is that which is one of the most significant and more important elements of the executive function of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no time to go into that in more detail, but I wanted to identify for everybody that the monarch's role is, as I have described, essentially the appointment during her pleasure of the person to be Governor-General and the Governor-General performs a continuing and important role as the executive head of government but subject to the disciplines imposed by section 63 of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking at the process for this convention, we need to look at what options are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3591"> available. I am one of those who is happy with the system at the moment. I certainly do not believe the timetable which Paul Keating laid down needs to be adhered to. I see nothing sacrosanct about 2001. I think it is a year to commemorate 1901. I think it is more important that the people of Australia understand and accept that, if we should decide we are no longer to be a monarchy, it is not going to fundamentally change the way in which our system works. I agree totally with the member for Lalor that very few really want Australia to adopt an American or French presidential system or one of the other alternative variants that are available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we want is essentially a continuity of our process. Again, it is easy to get into debate, but with 4&half; minutes left I am not going to. You could very easily say that we ought to get rid of the Senate. There are all those things. Look at the states and their relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is far more important, if we decide we are going to move away from a monarchy to some form of a republic, that we think of what alternatives are available. I would like to put to the House, in the brief time that I have available, what I see as probably an even more minimalist proposition than Paul Keating advanced and one that I think would allow that transition to a stage where I suspect at some time in the future we might want to move further to even greater independence. I put to this House that there is an alternative, which is that, instead of having, as has been proposed, a system of election of the head of state by a process of this parliament, an electoral college or the electorate at large or some other group, if we are going to move at all, it would be far better for us to constitute an Australian governors council.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Shut up for a minute, Daryl; I have 2&half; minutes. It is important we understand that, if we had an Australian governors council, we could then, through recommendations from the Prime Minister, after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, from state Premiers to the Australian governors council for governors, preserve our system with a genuine minimalist change. At a federal level, it would mean that the person who is the last Governor-General&mdash;providing he was alive; if not, then the most senior of the governors&mdash;would preside. If you were appointing a successor to the Victorian governor, for example, the immediately past Victorian governor would preside or, if not, the most senior of those who were governors-general or governors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By doing that, I would submit that you would be able to allow direct continuity of that one function that is defined within section 2 of the constitution. Instead of `appointed by the Queen' it would be `by the Australian governors council'. I would put in some conditions. At least section 44 should cover the requirements of the person to be nominated. If we change section 44, then of course it could well be that the same changes apply to everybody. But we have laid down certain requirements for a person to become a member of the Senate or the House of Representatives. I think it is appropriate that those same provisions should be applied. Section 44 actually refers to disqualification. But the constitution lays down provisions for a person to be capably made a member of the parliament. It really sets out in part 4, without identifying anyone in particular, that they could apply to the person to be made Governor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing that I think is important is that you have them subject to the same constraints as the Governor-General. So the Governor-General, having been pointed by that process, would act in accordance with section 63 of the constitution. In fact, what I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3592"> am putting to people is that, if there is to be change, there is a process by which you can have an Australian governors council which would maintain our federal system, maintain the system of appointment of governors-general and governors and would allow the continuation of Federation without prejudice to some future change that might well occur at some foreseeable time. I have actually said a little more and promulgated a little more of the concept elsewhere. But it is important that we think there are processes by which we can protect the system, and we do not want to feel that the constitution is inevitably entrenched. It is a living document and I think the process that I have suggested would in fact work. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite daunting, I must say, to follow the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who followed the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones)&mdash;two of the most experienced people in this House and certainly two people whose opinions on the issue of the constitution and its convention are certainly relevant and well respected, even though I would disagree with the right honourable member for New England as to what the outcome should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I enter this debate as someone who, in common with an overwhelming majority of Australians under the age of 40, supports a republic. It is certainly in the interests of those of us who support change for the constitutional convention, if it is to go ahead, to be one which is fair dinkum and one which assists the process of achieving as great a consensus as possible rather than one which inhibits and undermines the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I speak tonight in support of the amendments moved by the Labor Party in this House to the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill. Unless these amendments are carried, the whole process will certainly be undermined and really lead to nothing more than a waste of time, which will set back the inevitable process of change and do nothing to increase the cohesiveness of us as a society at a time when, given the current damaging questions of race being raised by the emergence of the One Nation party, the republic 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debate and the constitutional convention should be used so that they are a unifying force rather than a dividing one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, in my previous employment, was an ALP official and very proud to be one. I was proud to be a part of the ALP election campaign launch prior to the 1993 election because there the Prime Minister of the time, Paul Keating, outlined I think for the first time very clearly as an Australian leader that he would campaign openly for Australians to have their own head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It strikes me as astonishing that anyone in 1997 can argue that Australia should not have the right to appoint our own head of state. In Paul Keating's vision is something that is sadly lacking from the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this debate, because I think Australia has moved on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people in this House who were elected at the last election, including myself, are not, as might have been the case 40 years ago, totally Anglo-Saxon or Celtic. We do not have a view that our overall allegiance is to England in terms of the way that people in the Menzies era might have. It really is incumbent upon the Prime Minister and others to recognise that fact, that Australia has changed due to our migration program, due to the way that we see ourselves as a nation, so that we can stand on our own feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only argument that I have heard really against a change is from those who argue that there are some in the Labor Party who argue this just because we feel bitter about the events of 11 November 1975. I do not shy from that debate. If I was not before, I think it was due to the sorry events of that day that on that day&mdash;I was only 12 at the time&mdash;I became a republican, as did many of my peers. I was quite pleased, in fact, at being a student at St Mary's Cathedral. I was able to attend the demonstrations that were held in the Domain, my school playground, on the Friday after the coup of 1975. I must say that the Christian Brothers were very tolerant, because there were not many students in school that day and classes were effectively cancelled, not officially but due to students effectively voting with their feet.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3593">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then, I have been a republican, as I think are most people, certainly of my generation. I actually do not know anyone who is not, including those on the other side of the House, and they will tell you in private that yes, the present system is a bit of an anachronism in 1997. But I think what we have seen really, because the Prime Minister is someone who believes that the white picket fences are still there and who believes that Australia is the place today that it was 40 years ago, is an undermining of the whole process. Labor's amendments to this bill will try to address some of those questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first and most critical point is whether it should be a voluntary postal ballot or whether it should be a compulsory attendance ballot. The arguments are very clear. It seems to me that to argue anything other than that this debate is important enough for us to engage in the normal electoral process, at a time when everyone has argued&mdash;including the member for New England&mdash;that there is not a great understanding of our constitution and electoral process, is absolutely correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But under those circumstances, you do not introduce a one-off voting system to elect delegates to a convention that no-one could possibly understand. I have difficulty understanding the bill, and I got paid for 6&half; years to run election campaigns for the Labor Party&mdash;I must say, something that we did reasonably successfully in New South Wales over that period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sole argument appears to be one of cost. I ask this House: since when did democracy have a price tag on it? It really is an extraordinary proposition. It is envisaged in the explanatory memorandum to this bill that the cost of the election will be $35 million. The cost of the 1993 election, according to the AEC, was $46.6 million. It is estimated that a full and proper democratic election would cost $49 million at most. So you are talking in effect of a maximum figure of $14 million, in addition, to do it properly. If you have a choice of spending $49 million to actually get something that is useful at the end of the process or essentially wasting $35 million, then I do not think it is a matter of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increased cost. I think it is a matter of less waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not waste $35 million on holding a convention about which, before people even vote, people such as the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) are saying, `It doesn't matter.' He from the monarchist perspective says, `Even if 60 per cent of the people at the convention say that they support a particular form of republic, it won't really count for anything, because its credibility is undermined by the voluntary voting system.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it also stands in stark contrast that last Thursday there was an event in Melbourne&mdash;the opening of the casino. Sixty million dollars was spent on the opening of a casino&mdash;an obscene exercise by the mates of those opposite and the mates of the Kennett government. It is okay to spend $60 million on a casino opening, encouraging battlers to spend their money on gambling rather than on their families, on food, on housing, on cars, and on everyday life, but let us not spend $49 million on the constitutional convention! That is an absolute obscenity and something I think that does stand in very stark contrast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think also that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) today effectively pointed out Australia's important role internationally in terms of our development of the compulsory secret ballot as the Australian way&mdash;something which is called, internationally, the Australian ballot. Let us not walk away from that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week&mdash;another contrast&mdash;the minister for education announced the civics education package. We are going to go into the schools and spend all this money letting people know about the constitution. We are going to spend money on that, but we cannot spend money making sure that the election is fair dinkum, which comes down to my view that this is not really about money&mdash;it is about wasting money&mdash;but about making sure that the whole process is undermined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the process of the election and the structure of the convention there are a number of holes. One is the appointments process, whereby people will be appointed by the government. It is argued that this is so that we can ensure that there is proper representa 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3594"> tion, so that we can have indigenous people represented, young people represented, et cetera. But it ignores the fact that those groups are not homogenous. Surely in a democratic system we should allow those groups to elect their representatives. Let us allow ATSIC to elect the indigenous people. Let us allow YACA to appoint young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us allow a proper process which would feed into a system where people would be appointed by a joint parliamentary committee which would oversee that process, so that you have genuine representation and not a complete rorting of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who gets to decide who the ethnic community representatives are? To suggest that that is a homogenous community is extraordinary. There is nothing in the provisions of this bill that stops people just being plucked out according to the views they have on the constitution and on the republic. That undermines the faith of people in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My preferred position is that all delegates to the convention should be elected. It is not an unreasonable starting point that a constitutional convention should be democratic and that no-one should be appointed. But if you are going to appoint people, at least do it above board, at least have a process which allows for a bipartisan approach rather than the secret agenda that the government seeks to impose on the community in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of practicalities with the bill that simply are not allowed for and that our amendments to this bill attempt to fix&mdash;things such as the fact that the postal ballot means that the 200,000 people who are at any particular time overseas will be disenfranchised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Except in Antarctica, as the member for Lalor has correctly pointed out. Because you have how-to-vote cards distributed as if it were a normal compulsory attendance ballot you have people being assisted on the day. This process does not take into account the fact that in my electorate of Grayndler, for example, in over 40 per cent of households English is not the language they speak. But under this bill they are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> going to receive ballot papers and information with no ethnic languages provided&mdash;it will be solely in English&mdash;which disenfranchises many in the community from the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is worse is that the ballot papers are not even going to be consistent with the Senate ballot papers. The names on the tickets are not even going to be printed. What will occur is that on the ARM ticket or on the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy ticket there will be some abbreviations and just one name on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a supporter of the Australian Republican Movement. I find it pretty hard to give a vote to Nick Greiner, even though I agree him on this issue. I might want to number my ballot paper knowing who is getting my vote. Within those broad groupings there are differences of approach on the constitution. This will be a ballot paper whereby people do not know who they are voting for if they vote above the line. If you go into a polling booth in a general election and you vote Democrat or you vote Labor along the line you know where your preferences are going because you can see it; it is on display.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this process there will be registered how-to-vote cards, just like there are for the Senate, but you will not know. If you vote No. 1 ARM or Constitutional Monarchy or the Liberal Party or the Labor Party ticket or the Marrickville Residents for a Republic, you will not know where their preferences are going. And why wouldn't someone really cynical wake up to the fact that maybe you can run a ticket which sounds really nice, like `Marrickville Citizens for a Republic', but your preferences go to the monarchists? Why won't that occur? What is there to stop that occurring? Nothing. There are enough political professionals involved in this game of the Constitutional Convention that I would suggest that it certainly will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of other facts. Chances are that the two million people who change address every year will be left out in the cold as well. A point that was made to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee is very relevant. In submission No. 14 to the hearing that was held last Friday, a young gentleman by the name of Daniel Casey, of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3595"> South Caulfield, put forward a very compelling argument for young people, that is, people under the age of 18, to be represented. As he said&mdash;very respectfully, I must say: `At the next milestone for Australia, the sesquicentennial of Federation in 2051, I will be 70. Most of the over 18 delegates will be, I am sorry, dead.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to see a process&mdash;it is probably impractical&mdash;whereby young people of the age of 16, who I support getting a vote in general elections, would be allowed to vote in this process. But let us as a minimum allow them to stand and be represented. After all, they are going to inherit the results of the convention more than the generations of us who are older.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the real problems with this process&mdash;there are a number of difficulties which time does not allow me to go through&mdash;is the rorting, effectively, of the parliamentary representation, which is a breach of the tradition at previous conventions where there was equal representation. As it stands at the moment, of the 40 parliamentary representatives 25 will be from the coalition, only 13 from the Labor Party and two minor party or independent representatives. There is substantial precedent from every convention held from 1973 through to 1985 for equal representation. The failure to select the non&hyphen;parliamentary representatives also deserves to be looked at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing here is essentially a process being set up which is flawed from the beginning, a process which serves the objective of the Prime Minister to undermine an outcome which an ever&hyphen;increasing majority of Australians want, that is, a republic for Australia, one in which Australians have their own head of state. I think the preferred option, frankly, is to get on with it and have a referendum. Let us put it to the people of Australia because I think the outcome of that would be clear. The monarchists know that they are an ever&hyphen;increasing minority. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in joining in this debate because I think there are a number of things in this particular issue that need to be ex 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> posed. I wish to support the proposals put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the amendment that he moved earlier today in this debate. It is worth reiterating what this debate is not about, as well as what it is about. It is not about whether we want to choose the Queen to be the head of state or whether we want to have a republic. It is not about whether we want to have the Australian flag with the Union Jack in it or whether we do not. It is not about some of the more rabid points of view that are being put around the community at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this debate is about is how we get that process started. Unfortunately, too many lines have been drawn in the sand which people do not wish to pass over and there has been far too much&mdash;I nearly said `passion', but I don't mind passion in the argument&mdash;jingoism in the argument so far. What all that has done is help to destroy what should have been a very sensible proposition for Australians to consider. There is still time for us all to take a deep breath and try to decide how we come to some conclusion on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other countries around the world managed to sensibly make changes to their constitution to catch up with modern times and they did it far more sensibly than we are attempting to do it. I think the founding fathers, when they put our constitution together, decided to make it as hard as possible to do that in order to protect the smaller states. That was sensible in those days and there is probably less need for that now, but the reality is that that is there. The referendum process to change the constitution makes it very hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely, in the run&hyphen;up to this constitutional convention we should not be trying to strangle the idea at birth. That is what the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 does. This is a bill which has the fix already in. The government should either have the courage to say that they are not going to go ahead with this or have a fair ballot to have a fair convention. To try to rig the representation, as they have done, with the appointed nominees to start with, is a bit silly. There have been a number of constitutional conventions in this country since the 1890s. I went to one as a nominee of this parliament in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3596"> mid&hyphen;1980s. We did not have proportional representation there; we had a number of nominees of the Prime Minister and a number of nominees of the Leader of the Opposition. One wonders, of course, whether the government would have been so keen on proportionality if the last election had given them a majority of three or something like that. It suits the government to try to skew this, and it is the same for the state representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It just happens that around this country at present there is only one Labor state or territory government. So what have we got there? We have a fix in that too. Each of the states will send three people, the Leader of the Opposition, the Premier and another person nominated by the Premier. If the fix is in there, then you get two people from the government in all the states who will have a different from the government in New South Wales. Even in the government party here we will be very keen to see what the breakup of the people to represent this place is. If you talk to a number of people in the opposition, you find that on the opposition backbench there are a huge number of people who have a different view from the Prime Minister's view. One would be interested to see whether they are properly represented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the reason why the Leader of the Opposition has proposed this amendment. To have 16 parliamentary delegates appointed from the federal parliament consisting of eight members and senators appointed by the Prime Minister, six by the Leader of the Opposition, one by the leader of the Democrats and one to represent the other Independents in the place would give a more proper representation of the views around this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal also put forward by the Leader of the Opposition to increase the number of elected delegates to 80 to be chosen from the states and the territories so that you get a wider representation is a very good thing. Otherwise, if you start to have a convention where people have already tried to fix the outcome from the beginning, you will not get an outcome which the Australian people deserve. My point is that, if the fix is in, then the people deserve better than that and the government should look at some of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the proposals put forward by the Leader of the Opposition and, in a sense of fairness, deal with them properly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), a former member of the Queensland Liberal Party, recently attempted to establish a branch of her political party in Geelong. The attempt met with concerted opposition from a range of Geelong community groups concerned at the divisive impact her movement would have on the social harmony of our great city.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has always been a democratic society with proud democratic traditions and it is the legitimate right of any person to express their views on a range of issues and to set up branches of a political movement if they so desire. However, the member for Oxley ought to be aware that progressive elements in the electorate of Corio who value racial tolerance, who are concerned about unemployment and who treasure the social harmony of Geelong's multicultural society intend to challenge vigorously in public debate the more divisive elements of her political agenda. I am personally confident that once that debate takes place the narrow view of Australia and what it is and could become that is currently presented by the member for Oxley will be rejected by the overwhelming majority of citizens of goodwill in the Geelong region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put before the House today the record of great achievement of the Geelong community in embracing migrants and refugees from the four corners of the earth and providing them with a secure community environment in which to settle and make a new home and life for their families and contribute their talents to the development of this great manufacturing city of the Commonwealth. Their labours have built the great manufacturing firms of Geelong and their cultures have enriched the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3597"> social life of our community. So too has Geelong's Koori community contributed to the economic development and the cultural life of the region. These and other groups are naturally disturbed at elements of the political agenda being put by the member for Oxley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hanson agenda is fatally flawed. She pines for a Geelong and Australian community that simply does not exist, never can and never will. She apportions blame for the scourge of unemployment on minority groups and the immigration program, yet offers solutions that will massively increase unemployment in Geelong. Simply put, the implementation of the member for Oxley's agenda will not remove the teller machines from bank walls and replace them with young people behind the counters. The reality is that her agenda would cost Geelong thousands of jobs, decimate private businesses and wreck the future of thousands of families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One simple illustration demonstrates the point I am making. Ford, as a totally foreign owned company which is Geelong's biggest employer, recently invested over $1 billion in its Australian operations which secured the jobs of 2,700 Geelong workers. Is the member for Oxley seriously suggesting that the Geelong community should not have accepted that foreign investment in its Geelong plant? Without it, Geelong's economic future would not have been secured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley's agenda contains nothing new.

<SPEECH PAGE="3597" TIME="7.35 p.m." SPEAKER="Draper, Trish, MP" NAMEID="0L6" ELECTORATE="Makin" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House the harsh and deceptive conduct by Berklee Ltd towards franchise operators who, as a result of Berklee's company practices, have been financially devastated and demolished. As the member for Makin, I have been approached by constituents who have experienced significant losses after association with Berklee Ltd. These people have in the past been associated with Berklee Ltd in different areas of South Australia and have experienced serious personal and financial disadvantage. Consequently, some franchise operators have combined forces to seek justice in what appears to be a superior example of the failure by Berklee Ltd to meet any commitments and promises made to prospective owners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that my colleague the member for Capricornia, Mr Paul Marek, addressed the House in relation to this issue on Friday, 13 December 1996, and I strongly support his endeavours in this matter to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of background to my particular involvement, a delegation of constituents met with me and explained their concerns in my office earlier this year. To take one example 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3598"> from this group, Messrs Hossack purchased a Berklee franchise at 97 Brighton Road in the suburb of Glenelg in South Australia for $185,000 on 1 April 1989. At this time Berklee Retail Ltd claimed franchisees were granted distribution rights, so one could only purchase a Berklee muffler from a Berklee store and franchise operators could only purchase and sell Berklee products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this commitment continued only until July 1989 when Berklee Retail Ltd removed their embossed name from their product and began flooding the independent stores and retail outlets with stock. The franchise operators had no knowledge of this plan prior to Berklee's action. Further, this procedure effectively destroyed the Berklee franchises and left the operators bankrupt after investing their life savings into their small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of Messrs Hossack, an alternative enterprise, `Speedy Mufflers', commenced trading at a nearby location at 93 Glenelg Road in August 1989. Only four months after Mr Hossack and his brother purchased the Berklee franchise down the road, Berklee Retail Ltd was then contacted by the Hossack brothers and I understand their concerns were discussed. But this meeting, from all accounts, was unable to allay any of their concerns. Further, I understand that their concerns were considered unimportant. Prior knowledge of the establishment of the Speedy Muffler enterprise was denied by Berklee Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, a copy of the Glenelg Council letter sent to Berklee Ltd, dated 7 February 1989, supports the view that Berklee Ltd had prior knowledge of Speedy Muffler's plans and that they concealed this fact from the prospective franchise operators. Negotiations that Messrs Hossack, Murphy, Griffiths and Faggotter held with Berklee Ltd and their discussions with Mr Brian Graham, South Australian Operations Manager, and Mr John Rippon, National Marketing Manager, did not reveal this fact to those purchasing the franchises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, there were reports of tactics being employed such as cutting power supplies to the businesses during usual hours of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> operation, and Berklee Retail Ltd stopping payment of rent to landlords of the properties and effectively excluding people from their businesses by changing their locks. Messrs Murphy, Griffiths, Faggotter and Hossack took to sleeping inside their premises to protect their interests from further interference from Berklee Ltd. These disreputable strategies used by Berklee Ltd proved to be an obvious attempt to dissuade the franchisees from further action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Arguably, in advertising these franchises, Berklee Retail Ltd portrayed their enterprises to the prospective operators in a shamelessly deceitful manner. Further, a commitment was made to provide a 10 per cent royalty of total turnover, which would be paid by franchisees to be used for advertising, promotion and marketing, and demographic surveys. Mr Rippon also assured the franchisees that 50 per cent of these advertising funds paid by them would be used in their local area. Other undertakings such as training for the new staff, back&hyphen;up and support for the franchise operators and promised national advertising campaign were also not honoured by Berklee. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3598"><TITLE>Member for Oxley</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the adjournment debate tonight to condemn the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) for her statements on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>  program last Thursday night. Her comments on this program, I personally believe, exposed her for the hate&hyphen;monger that she is. I said as much when I brought forward a private member's motion on racism in June last year. It was a motion which condemned the member for Oxley and those like her who had disgraced themselves and the democratic process by playing the race card during the last federal election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While watching the member for Oxley flounder last Thursday night, I was filled with complete and utter outrage at the lies she was telling, not just in regard to Asian immigration and the numbers of Asian born Australians but in particular about the people of Fairfield, which is in my electorate, and the area of Cabramatta, which is just outside my boundary. I come into this House tonight to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3599"> set the member for Oxley straight on these matters regarding my community&mdash;a community which she obviously knows nothing about. I do not expect that what I say will make any difference to her whatsoever; she has proven herself incapable of even trying to listen to reason. But I am damned if I am going to let the people of my electorate&mdash;the people I have lived with and worked with for over 40 years; the people I have represented at all three levels of government for over 25 years&mdash;be attacked and smeared in such an outrageous fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We may have our problems in Cabramatta and Fairfield&mdash;and they are well publicised. But they are problems which are not specific to any one culture or ethnic background: they affect us all. We are also a thriving community, rich in civic pride and full of concern about each other's and our community's wellbeing. The member for Oxley has no such concern for us. She has been to Cabramatta&mdash;so I have been told&mdash;on a very quick, private, whistlestop tour; she has never set foot in Fairfield, to my knowledge. If she had any concern for our area she would not spread such inflammatory and divisive lies about us without concern for the damage and suspicion that they create. How brave of the member for Oxley to spread this malicious gossip and then not be around to pick up the pieces when it does its damage!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what did the member for Oxley say? She said, about Cabramatta's Asian population, `If you go to Cabramatta, there's street signs up in their own language.' That is an outright lie. The member for Oxley has lied on this point. If she has not lied and has simply based her comments on misinformation, I would suggest that she come into this House and admit her mistake and retract her statement. There is not a single street sign in Cabramatta, nor anywhere within the Fairfield City boundaries, which is written in Vietnamese, Chinese, Laotian, Khmer, Italian, Macedonian or any other language. Not one of the over 100 languages spoken in my community&mdash;apart from English&mdash;is used on any of our street signs. The street signs are written in English, they have always been in English and they will remain so.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley then said&mdash;and, again, I will use her words&mdash;`Ask the parents at Fairfield why have there been notes sent home with the children that their children must learn Vietnamese.' This is another lie. The children of Fairfield have not been told they must learn Vietnamese as part of some sort of sinister re&hyphen;education campaign. I have been assured of this by the district superintendent of the state department of education. Where the member for Oxley may be getting confused&mdash;and I know she gets confused quite easily&mdash;is that there are many language courses offered in the schools in my area. Starting from this year, all year seven students in New South Wales&mdash;continuing until year 10&mdash;are required to study one language for 100 hours in one 12&hyphen;month period in order to be awarded the school certificate. This is a language of their choice; no&hyphen;one puts a gun to their heads and tells them what they have to study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some primary schools in my area offer languages under the LOTE program&mdash;languages other than English&mdash;as part of their normal curriculum. For the kids this is an opportunity to learn a few key phrases in a particular language and some background on the culture. We should be thankful that this is the case. As for which language they learn, that depends on the resources available in the school and whether there are teachers working at the school who are proficient enough in a language to teach it. One year the language may be Vietnamese, the next it may be French. Many schools in my area also take part in the community languages program, which is designed to foster and further develop the language that kids from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds use at home. A child can only participate in the program after parental permission has been given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I thought it would do any good, I would invite the member for Oxley to spend some time in Fairfield and Cabramatta and see how 130 different cultures live happily together side by side. But I know it would be a waste of time, because she would not be coming to listen to our views. She has already proven herself to have a very closed mind on these matters. She would be coming to use our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3600"> community for her own ends and divide us with her prejudices in the process. I warn the honourable member for Oxley, keep out of my community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have before me extracts from some of the local newspapers. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Central Coast Express Advocate</EMPHASIS> has the heading, `Clubs in crisis'. An editorial from Bob Staines, the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Central Coast Express Advocate</EMPHASIS>, is headed, `Dump rise or be kicked out'. That is the effect that those tax rises are having on our community. The people of the Central Coast are outraged. Communities on the Central Coast rely on their local clubs, which input a huge amount of money to the communities of the Central Coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the federal member for Robertson, I have been working very hard to stimulate growth and employment on the Central Coast of New South Wales. I have been particularly involved in the community of Ettalong, through their main street program and through the work of people like Deborah Wales. I was thrilled when we launched the New South Wales black spot funding in the community of Ettalong. The reason that community was selected to launch the New South Wales black spot funding was the fact that the community had raised a large amount of money from the shop owners and the registered club&mdash;the Ettalong Beach War Memorial Club&mdash;to input into the construction of a roundabout to save lives and to help employment in Ettalong. All this sort of funding is now put at risk, simply because of this tax slug from the New South Wales Labor government. They have no consideration for the effect it is having.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears that the New South Wales government is trying to undermine all the good work that the federal government is putting into the Central Coast of New South Wales. Already we have had difficulties with the establishment of our international garden festival&mdash;the Planet Earth 2000 project&mdash;where the New South Wales government seemed to be intent on causing difficulties for the establishment of that project. I am pleased that that project is still going ahead. As I mentioned, there is now a real possibility that the black spot funding may be undermined because of the lack of community contributions that would have come from the clubs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have quotes here from the manager of the Ettalong Beach War Memorial Club. They had major plans for upgrading. The manager, Peter Hale, quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Central Coast Express Advocate</EMPHASIS> this week, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a $45 million project to rebuild the Ettalong club, including a 200&hyphen;room hotel, was now under review.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This project was the lifeblood of the township of Ettalong, a township made up of hardworking, battling Australians. This project was the economic stimulus to get this town moving again. All this has been put under threat by this ridiculous increase in turnover tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Mr Hale, this tax will cost 500 jobs over two years. Mr Hale also said that typical sponsorship was threatened to clubs such as the Umina Beach Surf Club, which the club was sponsoring for $75,000 over three years. This is just one of the examples of the good work that is done by the Central Coast registered clubs. The Central Coast Leagues Club, one of the biggest clubs in New South Wales, also stated that many of its community projects are at risk. The Central Coast Leagues Club gives assistance totalling $5 million a year to the community, and to cricket, rugby league, soccer, Aussie rules and other sporting groups. All these sorts of projects are now at risk, simply because of the tax grab from the New South Wales Labor government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the years, I have attended hundreds of naturalisation ceremonies and been associated with parliamentary colleagues from the state and federal parliaments and from the Liberal Party who, on every occasion, have extended their congratulations and best wishes to those people of Asian origin who chose to become Australian citizens. I have never had any reason to doubt their sincerity and I now know that members on both sides of this House deplore the incoherent and racist attitude that has been displayed, not merely in this parliament but outside this parliament, by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). She has the support of longstanding racist organisations who are only too happy to provide her with a platform&mdash;I refer to the racist and anti&hyphen;Semitic organisation known as the League of Rights. In over 30 years in politics, I have never heard any member of any parliament say of one group of constituents, `I will not deal with you, I will not represent you, for no other reason than that you belong to an indigenous group of citizens,' and I, of course, refer to the Aboriginal citizens of Oxley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the important aspects of this place is the unique position enjoyed by the Prime Minister, who has not only a role of political leadership over and beyond his direct political responsibilities to his party but also a moral authority. For some months now editorial writers, religious leaders and leaders of the ethnic communities have been asking the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to give a lead on this important issue and to demonstrate that in no way does the member for Oxley represent the broad views, or even the narrow views, of members of this House and the Australian community generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For months now church leaders, multicultural leaders, editorial writers and community leaders have been looking for that state 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment&mdash;not just on the basis that our trade with Asia would be affected or that the tourism industry in Queensland would be affected but on the basis that, over the years, ministers for immigration on both sides of politics have done a great deal to develop the sort of society in which we live: a multicultural society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister well knows&mdash;I do not have to remind him&mdash;that in my electorate there are many citizens who were victims of Hitler's holocaust. They learnt, through painful experience, that the first exercise before you got to the concentration camps or the gas chambers was to dehumanise the Jewish people so that they were not real people&mdash;they were a vague threat in all sorts of ways. There is no place in Australian society for that position to be developed against any member of our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) indicated that, due to the attitudes of the member for Oxley, there is no way she would get the preferences of the Labor Party, that she would be at the bottom of the ticket, and he invited the Prime Minister to adopt such a lead. I would have understood if the Prime Minister had said, `I would like to talk to my party about it.' I would have understood if he had said, `I would like to think about it.' But what we got was a pathetic no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, in adopting that position, the Prime Minister not merely failed to give an effective lead to his own party but also failed to give an effective lead to the people of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this year a mobile phone tower was constructed in Murrumba Downs, a suburb in the northern reaches of my electorate. I know that the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, is interested in this issue as well. It is pleasing to see him here. Having read his very early speech on this subject, I think he is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3602"> certainly someone who has assisted me in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular tower is an absolute blot on the landscape. It was erected in the space of one morning. It does not give me much pleasure to say this, but it is the product of an unholy alliance, in my view, between Vodafone and a local church which has seen fit to overlook the concerns of local residents in favour of the return to be derived from leasing part of its land to the mobile phone provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say `an unholy alliance' because Queensland churches anyway&mdash;I do not know about other parts of Australia&mdash;are put at a very significant advantage in the community in that they have a rates exemption because they carry on an activity of religious instruction and education, and otherwise ceremony and tradition. So they get a rates allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a church to abuse, in my view, that special privilege by entering into a commercial deal with a phone carrier is totally unacceptable and something that the state government, maybe even the federal government, has to look at. Certainly, the state government could use the Local Government Act, but perhaps the federal government should bring some influence to bear there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The positioning of the tower is alarming. It is in very close proximity to the Undurba State School and Inverpine Retirement Village and is immediately adjacent to a kindergarten. It is also flush&hyphen;up against the boundary of a neighbouring property. The particular person concerned was never consulted about the positioning of this tower by the church.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerned residents will be meeting at my office this coming week to discuss health and safety issues with independent expert, Dr Thiel of Griffith University. Vodafone representatives attending a recent meeting of the school P&amp;C Association were asked by a parent whether Vodafone had ever moved a tower. One of the representatives replied, `No, and it is unlikely that we would ever do so.' To make matters worse, the facility erected by Vodafone, subject to local authority consent, could be upgraded or used by other service providers. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, Murrumba Downs has another contaminant, namely, pay 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> TV aerial cables. This time it is not Vodafone but Telstra. The residents of one street&mdash;which, incidentally, was promoted as a quality estate, with all underground services&mdash;have been told that they either get aerial cables, whether they want them or not, or, incredibly, they pay $300 to have them installed underground. They have until 27 May to decide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say `incredibly' because there is no demand, it appears, in the particular estate to have these so-called services. Telstra is saying, `If you want them underground you pay for them,' but they do not want them in the first place&mdash;an extraordinary non sequitur, I would have thought. The residents presented a petition to the local authority, the Pine Rivers Shire Council, about the Telstra plans but, until the new telecommunications code takes effect on 1 July 1997, it is powerless to intervene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other side of my electorate, at Everton Park, another elderly constituent has found the Optus pay TV aerial cables and an attendant large black box affixed to the electricity poll near his home so intolerable that he feels like climbing the pole with bolt cutters to rid himself of the eyesore. In my electorate, Vodafone, Telstra and Optus have caused their share of distress. People are forced to cop this sort of thing and it is really unacceptable&mdash;1 July cannot come soon enough.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We on this side of the House will not detain the passage of this legislation for too long. I should signal at the outset that both the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1997, which are the bills under discussion this morning, are supported by the opposition. My friend and colleague the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) will be raising some issues associated with the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1997 that he believes need to be addressed. In the main, these are not, I think, controversial by their nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, in fact, seeks to change the way in which excise duty is calculated and paid on stabilised crude petroleum oil from three times a month to once a month and will take effect from 1 July this year. These amendments are in conjunction with amendments which are contained in the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1997. The second thing that this bill does is to remove liquid petroleum gas, which is currently excise free, from the application of the tariff act. Thirdly, this specific bill decreases the excise duty on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene by 0.75c per litre, with effect from 1 September 1997. This is as a result of an over&hyphen;collection of duty during 1995&hyphen;96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reductions also take account of the reduction in operating costs of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the forecast growth in airline activity. I am not sure about that reduction in operating costs for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority with the recent appointment there. I am sure, as time goes on, we will see how effective that is, with the pay&hyphen;off to the new deputy chairman of that organisation by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This affords me the opportunity, whilst these two bills are within the House, to make a couple of passing comments in respect of petroleum and to actually pay a compliment to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser). It is not often, I suspect, when a budget is less than 24 hours old that an opportunity can be taken by the opposition to pay a compliment to a minister for having taken a decision which is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances and which probably has been long overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am talking, of course, about the crackdown on dangerous fuel substitution. I say to the minister that this is a very appropriate and timely decision the government has taken. As was announced last night in the budget, the government is going to clamp down on dangerous fuel substitution by introducing chemical tracers for concessional fuel. This should be bad news, as the minister pointed out in his press release, for shonky operators who sell fuel blends containing concessional and waste fuel products as automotive diesel in order to avoid tax. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3606"> The concept embodied in that, of course, is very significant in terms of the bills that we are debating here this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your benefit and, I am sure, for the benefit of other members, that this is a practice which has been going on for some time. What has tended to emerge&mdash;certainly in metropolitan areas and in cities such as my own city of Wollongong&mdash;is the growth of service stations which are not linked directly to one of the major suppliers in this country. The effect of that is that people have been buying in fuel from different sources and, as a consequence, the mix that has been retailed by these smaller operators has probably not been the purest form of fuel that should be sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect that that has had is that it has been a real boon for automotive repair shops and automotive tuners in my electorate of Cunningham, because consumers who see that they are getting petrol which is often several cents cheaper than at a service station operated by Shell, Mobil, or whatever, on the opposite corner to them suddenly find that one or two uses of this fuel lead to dreadful engine problems in their vehicles. As a consequence, they have to take them off to automotive repairers, to people who are charged with the responsibility of tuning these engines up, and what they are finding is all manner of muck contained in that particular fuel blend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted to see that the minister is here. Minister, I was just singing your praises for the budget initiative last night with respect to the crackdown on dangerous fuel substitution. Now that you are here, let me congratulate you, face to face. It is a measure that is long overdue. I was just relating some circumstances in my own electorate where, in recent times, this has been highlighted as a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have done, on this side of the House, is conduct a price watch on petrol in a number of electorates. Over a few months now, one of the issues which is constantly coming up is the concern about the shonkier dealers, people who are buying fuel mixes which often contain sediment and have a whole range of other problems, or the mix that has been put into that fuel has been inappropriate. I was saying, Minister, that it has actually improved the opportunities for people who tune up vehicles to have a tremendous business in Wollongong, because a number of these service stations are now operating. So I say to you again that the measure that you announced last night in the budget is a very welcome one in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To return to the legislation before the Main Committee, the opposition has no problem with the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997. We give it our unqualified support. I want to thank the minister for the opportunity that was provided to me and my staff for a briefing on this particular matter and the courteous way in which that briefing was conducted by officers of his department and from the Australian Customs Service. It is refreshing to see that level of cooperation and I appreciate it greatly. I wish this legislation speedy passage through the Main Committee and, indeed, through the parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just say a few words on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1997. The Howard government came to office with simple promises to the Australian people: we promised to talk with Australians, not at them; we said we would give Australians a say in public policy and make public policy making a public matter once more. That is the principle that has made the Charter of Budget Honesty a keystone of fiscal responsibility at the federal level. It is a principle that has fuelled much&hyphen;needed reform to tax collections for the tax law improvement project; likewise with the small business deregulation task force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3607">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gives me precious little satisfaction to learn that, as recently as March last year, this parliament was passing about three times as many acts as its Canadian or British counterparts and that the amount of paperwork generated by the parliament has expanded exponentially in recent years. These are not issues that are in some way irrelevant to the needs of the Australian community. The government's election policy said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Complex and convoluted laws require lawyers to interpret them. The more complex the law, the longer the lawyer will take and the greater the cost. The average citizen has little hope of understanding the laws.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The prospect of lawyers profiting from the misfortune of the public and the inadequacy of the parliament does not please me, for one, nor the government as a whole. For this reason I am honoured to speak on the legislation before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two bills we are addressing seek to clarify the law so as to ensure fair and efficient excise collection in the industries of stabilised crude petroleum oil, crude oil and liquid petroleum gas, better know as LPG. Instead of forcing producers to calculate excise amounts and make payments of excise 36 times a year, this concurrent legislation will increase the length of that prescribed division to a month. The result&mdash;one&hyphen;third the number of calculations of payments in a year&mdash;will help alleviate the administrative burden presently imposed on crude oil producers. The reforms will also reduce the government's meddling in this market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reforms are motivated by a commitment to greater flexibility and understanding on the part of government and reflect significant changes in the crude oil industry itself. In the mid&hyphen;1980s, the current excise system allowed the government to take advantage of the boom in Bass Strait crude oil production. In fact, it has been noted that in 1984&hyphen;85 $4.2 million was collected in this manner in excise payments. Since then, significant amendments have been made to the collection system as the crude oil market was deregulated and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987, which determines the volware price of crude oil, was passed. Yet the administrative mess that necessitated 36 annual payments and calculations remained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the extension of the petroleum resource rent tax regime to Bass Strait reduced the number of payees to only three, excise collected on crude oil dived to $12.2 million in 1995&hyphen;96. It seems ridiculous to continue with such an outdated and burdensome system on such amounts of collectable excise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the amendment bills before us have been developed by the government in full and open consultation with the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. The amendments also ensure consistent treatment of LPG by making production of LPG excise exempt by removing LPG from the ambit of the tariff act. This will remove the administrative burden on producers of LPG and the government, and bring the treatment of offshore LPG production in line with onshore LPG production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments are also being made to the rates of excise duty on aviation gasoline, better known as avgas, and aviation kerosene, better known as avtur&mdash;a very welcome move in my own electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I commend these two bills to the House and state to the parliament my hope that we will see similar legislation in many other areas of Commonwealth law and taxation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1997. They are appropriately being dealt with together as a package. In a strict portfolio sense, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), the shadow minister for small business and customs, has dealt directly with the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill. As shadow minister for resources and energy, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3608"> I propose, as my colleague the member for Cunningham indicated, to make some comments about the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, in his second reading speeches on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill in his own right and on the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill on behalf of the Minister for Resources (Senator Parer), detailed the arrangements to be effected by the package of legislation. In effect, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill change the way in which excise duty is calculated and paid on crude petroleum oil from three times a month to once a month from 1 July of this year. That bill removes liquid petroleum gas, which is currently excise free, from the application of the tariff act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill reflects those changes and also removes the requirement to determine the volume weighted average of realised prices for oil producing regions which have exceeded the excise free threshold but have not produced oil at a rate which attracts an excise liability. It also removes the need to determine a reference price for oil for the following month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are technical provisions which provide for better administration. They are supported by industry. The relevant formal industry association, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association&mdash;APPEA&mdash;supports these measures. They are supported by the opposition on the merits, but also because they were initiated by the now opposition when in government. They did not reach the stage of legislation, but the substantive decisions had been made prior to the last election. If they had reached the stage of legislation and been introduced by the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), in his then capacity as Minister for Resources and Energy, I am sure his speeches would have been almost precisely the same as the speeches of the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) on the occasion that he introduced the bills in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are technical bills, but they reflect important policy and a shift in the nature of tax arrangements so far as the petroleum industry is concerned over the years. This was touched upon by the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) in his contribution. Basically, they reflect the change of taxation arrangements, so far as the petroleum industry is concerned, from excise or royalty to resources rent tax. That is a secondary tax, or a tax on profit, which is generally regarded by the petroleum industry&mdash;it is certainly regarded by those on this side of the parliament&mdash;as being a more appropriate taxation regime. It taxes profit. The petroleum industry, based as it is on the high risk of exploration, regards this as a more appropriate arrangement. Certainly, on our side of the House, we regard it as a much more effective arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Excise, so far as petroleum is concerned, is currently only payable on a small number of petroleum producing fields. Since the diminution of production in Bass Strait, we are really talking about the Jackson field in south&hyphen;west Queensland, the Harriet fields in Western Australia and, when production starts in the course of the next financial year, the Wannaea field in the North West Shelf region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst these bills and measures are technical, they do reflect some significant changes in the petroleum and oil industry over the years. In the 1970s and 1980s the crude oil regime represented the Commonwealth's most significant petroleum production taxation mechanism. In some years that collection was as high as $4 billion per annum. We are now in the hundred million range, or lower.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3609">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of a decline over those years in oil prices coupled with, as I have indicated, the development of the resources rent tax and movements in those areas, we have seen the Commonwealth's collection move more comprehensively to resources rent tax. We have also seen the diminution of Bass Strait as a production area. Whilst I am sure the member for Forrest and the Minister for Small Business, like me, puts on his selfish parochial cap and says that to some extent the expense of Bass Strait has been at the great burgeoning of the North West Shelf so far as the national mix is concerned, that has also been reflected by the Commonwealth's collections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those remaining crude oil areas which are excisable, as I have indicated, now come into the hundreds of millions or less, rather than the $4 billion peak. We are dealing with much smaller areas. The administrative and technical changes which are being made really reflect a significantly smaller volume production. Whilst the regime which is proposed to be amended by the bills was appropriate in earlier years for much larger production areas, it is administratively unsound for the current volume of production. It is administratively inefficient. The regime places an unnecessary burden, not on only the department but, also and more importantly, on industry. Consequently, these measures are supported without reservation by the opposition. Like my colleague the member for Cunningham, we compliment the minister on bringing it forward.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the speakers, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) and the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). I note the congratulations from the member for Cunningham on our initiatives in regard to fuel substitution. I am sure that as the Shadow Minister for Customs, he would also be pleased with our program to substantially upgrade the Customs marine fleet. I know that he has had some interest in the Customs area in the past and our initiative of $26 to $27 million over the four&hyphen;year period and the major upgrade of the Customs marine fleet both in size and number will help Customs in their role to secure our borders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of these bills is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987. As honourable members have stated, these bills are a legislative package which include, firstly, an alteration to the arrangements for the calculation and payment of excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil. The proposed amendment here reduces the calculation and payment of excise duty on stabilised crude oil from 36 times per financial year to 12 times per year&mdash;a significant cutting of red tape in anyone's language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 also require consequential amendments to the calculation of volware prices under the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act. It is proposed that these amendments will commence on 1 July 1997 to avoid any difficulties that may arise from the overlap in the two different timing arrangements during a financial year. The proposed amendments to the Excise Tariff Act and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act have been developed after consultation with the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill removes LPG from the ambit of the Excise Tariff Act. At present, LPG produced from offshore fields that came into production after 17 August 1977 is excisable under this act, although the current rate of excise on LPG is `free'. This bill makes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3610"> the production of LPG excise exempt by removing LPG from the ambit of the Excise Tariff Act. This will remove another unnecessary administrative burden from the producers of LPG and the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill also proposes decreases in the rate of excise duty on aviation gasoline&mdash;avgas&mdash;and aviation kerosene&mdash;avtur&mdash;of 75c per litre, with effect from 1 September 1996. The decreases in the excise duty on avgas and avtur were the result of an over&hyphen;collection of excise duty on these products during 1995&hyphen;96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction also takes account of the reduction in the operating costs of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the forecast growth in airline activity, which will lead to increases in the consumption of aviation fuels. The decreases were proposed in Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 of 1996, which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 16 September 1996 and took effect from 1 September 1996.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Broadcasting Services Legislation Amendment Bill and the cognate bills that we are dealing with today are supported by the opposition. I will explain our reasons for supporting these three pieces of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, on the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1997 and the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1997, we believe that in many ways the current government is implementing the views of the former government and the former minister on this issue&mdash;that is, that the government is seeking to ensure that the community continues to get a return from the private use of frequencies for radio and television broadcasts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3611">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, certainly ever since we have had television and over the many years of the existence of radio, we have had an expectation that those companies that are awarded television and radio licences should pay an annual fee to the taxpayer as a return to the community for allowing that company the exclusive use of the scarce radio electromagnetic spectrum. One of the difficulties which arose during the time I had the honour to serve as the minister for communications was an anomaly that emerged in the Broadcasting Services Act, as originally enacted by this parliament. The anomaly was that all of the existing radio and television licence holders knew that they were up for a certain annual licence fee, but the act provided for the auctioning to new licensees of new frequencies. As the act was originally passed by the parliament, they would be auctioned, the government would get the maximum price, and those licensees would pay no licence fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that immediately meant that every one of the existing radio licence holders was knocking at the government's door to demand that the anomaly be removed by exempting them from having to pay annual licence fees&mdash;which would have been a massive handout to all of the existing radio and television licence holders. Given that these are some of the most profitable companies in Australia&mdash;although, admittedly, some of the people involved in the radio industry are small families in the bush and are not large companies&mdash;it would have been ridiculous to have given such a massive financial benefit to some of the largest companies in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The alternative way to overcome the anomaly was to impose the same regime on the new licence holders as has traditionally been placed on the existing radio and television licence holders, which is what the former government said it would do and what this government is now implementing; and this is one of the main reasons we are supporting the proposal which is before the committee at the moment. We think the public should continue to receive that annual payment in licence fees as some return to the community for the exclusive use of that scarce spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Broadcasting Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 also clarifies the powers of the Australian Broadcasting Authority to inquire into on&hyphen;line services. This is as a result of some questions being raised about the excellent work that the ABA has been carrying out in investigating the regulation of on&hyphen;line services in Australia. At my request during the life of the former government, the ABA produced a report, which was tabled after the change of government, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investigation into the content of on&hyphen;line services</EMPHASIS>. It is quite important that we do not leave it to the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and the Office of Film and Literature Classification to look at the issues of regulation and censorship that will inevitably arise with the development of the Internet and other proprietary on&hyphen;line services, probably through subsets of the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and many other members of this House welcome young children and schools being given increased access to many of these high&hyphen;tech pieces of equipment that equip them with better skills for better jobs in their future life, but there are many community concerns about some of the material to which children can easily gain access through the Internet. This has been the subject of a number of stories, some of which have exaggerated and sensationalised the threat. Many parents have quite legitimate concerns about how easy it may be for their children to look up how to make an explosive bomb from agricultural chemicals, or about how some people might use the Internet to transmit photographs involving child pornography, for example.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3612">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While most people think of the Internet these days as a mechanism for transmitting words and data, dangerous information available could include, for example, how to make a bomb. It could also be used to transmit photographs but, in the not too distant future, it will be easier for people to transmit audio signals&mdash;and, of course, video is not too far away at all. As a community, we have established quite strict categories for the regulation of film and television, and it would be quite ridiculous for us to have tough regulations on classification and censorship in film and television but to allow a whole new method of communication to develop that bypassed those regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many complex issues are raised by this, because in many ways it is impossible to regulate the Internet. Australia cannot pass laws which govern the citizens of all the other countries that are connected to the Internet. Despite the complexity, some countries have tried to regulate this and have tried to pass laws which put the onus on the Internet service provider to ensure that there is no illegal, outrageous or dangerous material available through that particular company's access to the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a great debate in the US Congress about how some conservative members of Congress wanted to make the Internet service providers&mdash;companies that provided access to the Internet&mdash;legally accountable for any unsavoury material that people could get access to through the Internet. I think quite rightly the US Congress, after a lot of debate, a lot of heat and I am not sure how much light, decided not to go down that path. I understand that in some countries in Europe that debate is still wending its way through their legislatures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia we have tried to make sure that there is cooperation between the federal government and the state governments on ways that we can make it an offence for people to store and misuse material they may get from the Internet. A number of charges have been laid in recent years arising from this and I think we have to see if we can come up with commonsense ways to ensure that we are doing all we can to protect Australian children without passing laws that are unenforceable or laws that try to impose legal obligations on Internet service providers that are just unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The long&hyphen;term hope for the side is that a number of the large software companies are developing software filters. I am sure that several members present would be aware of some schools that have developed their own smaller pool within the Internet which simply restricts quite severely the material that young children in a school can access on their school computer equipment, perhaps limiting their access to material that is stored on CD&hyphen;ROMs and other material. That is one way to impose some restrictions on what children at various schools can access, while also giving them the additional training and skills to use this new technology, which is welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue that is dealt with in the Broadcasting Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 is a change to the cross&hyphen;media ownership rules. The change which is proposed in this act is something which the opposition supports. It seeks to make a minor modification to the rules in the way they affect small companies in one particular service area&mdash;Brisbane. The difficulty that has arisen in Brisbane involves Australian Provincial Newspapers, a company which owns 4KQ, one of the major radio stations in Brisbane. The company also owns the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Times</EMPHASIS>, which is the main daily newspaper in Ipswich.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3613">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cross&hyphen;media ownership rules were meant to restrict common ownership between the main radio stations and the main television stations in capital cities and also in country towns. In the case of Brisbane, it was meant to restrict common ownership in the television stations, the radio stations and the main metropolitan dailies of Brisbane. It was never intended to impose some restriction on a paper as small as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Times</EMPHASIS>. The fact that the legislation quite deliberately set out to ensure there was no common ownership between 4KQ and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> has, because of the way the legislation is worded, had an unintended effect of saying that there cannot be common ownership between the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Times</EMPHASIS> and 4KQ. It has led to some quite ridiculous circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the legislation, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Times</EMPHASIS> is included in the cross&hyphen;media ownership rules if more than 50 per cent of its circulation is within the service area of 4KQ. The company ensures that it complies with the law by distributing free of charge sufficient copies of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Times</EMPHASIS> outside the 4KQ service area so that those within the area are less than that 50 per cent threshold. As a result, large quantities of newspaper and newsprint are being used for no benefit other than to ensure that the law is not breached on cross&hyphen;media ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposal is quite sensible. It simply seeks to say that if a paper such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Times</EMPHASIS> has a total circulation which is less than two per cent of the total newspaper daily circulation in the city concerned, in this case Brisbane, then we do not intend to have that paper caught up in the cross-media ownership provisions. As I understand it, the circulation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Times</EMPHASIS> is about one per cent of the total Brisbane circulation so it meets that concern without any difficulty whatsoever. That minor change of cross-media ownership is something that the opposition is willing to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the cross-media ownership rules are on the table here today, I am sure you would be surprised if I was not tempted, as a former minister, to make a few passing remarks about the tar baby which this government has attached itself too, the tar baby of the Prime Minister's attempts to water down, if not abolish, the cross-media ownership rules with all of the media speculation that this is to benefit Mr Packer's company.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation seeks to amend the cross-media ownership rules which were introduced in 1987. Some people try to say that, in some way, those 1987 rules were meant to punish the Fairfax group. It is true that John Fairfax, after changes in its ownership, did not comply with the cross-media ownership rules and it ended up selling off some of its media assets, as did Rupert Murdoch, and as did the Herald and Weekly Times group. That was because in those cross-media ownership rules we said that no&hyphen;one should be able to own a television station and a radio station, or a television station and a major newspaper in the same city.</PARA>

It is quite clear that those rules affected Mr Murdoch as much as it affected the Herald and Weekly Times and Fairfax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important point about this legislation and the way it is seeking to change the cross-media ownership rules is that it is trying to restore the balance in the cross-media ownership rules.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would like to encourage the member for Bass to return to his position as the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman as soon as possible. The point I am trying to make, not picking up too many of the interjections, is that a lot of people on both sides of the House support that principle, that you should either be big in television, a prince of the screen, or be involved in newspapers, but you should not be able to have both. That is the crucial point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1991, the current Prime Minister, John Howard, actually signed a petition saying that he was opposed to any further concentration of media ownership. What gets me is that Mr Howard is now going against the position that he adopted in 1991, a position that an overwhelming majority of members of the Australian parliament had in 1991. The member for Bass at that time signed the petition. It was the view of the overwhelming majority of people in 1991 that Mr Packer should not be allowed to get control of Fairfax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has changed today? Why is Mr Packer advancing the arguments to allow Mr Packer to purchase the Fairfax Group? To have the cabinet of Australia sit down and work out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3615"> whether the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> can be carved off from the Fairfax Group, to allow the cabinet of Australia to try to redesign the media landscape is, I think, the height of impertinence. It will only advance the interests of one company, and that is Mr Packer's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important point I want to make is that some people are saying that we need to abolish these cross&hyphen;media ownership rules that are before the committee here today. The people, such as Mr Howard, who are saying that we need to abolish the cross&hyphen;media ownership rules are saying that in some way that means we will end up with stronger Australian companies. Mr James Packer goes around saying that this will mean that they could export the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> to the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with that theory is that Rupert Murdoch took his company to the rest of the world, and he did that from a very small base. He started in Adelaide with an afternoon newspaper, I think it was. He picked up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Mirror</EMPHASIS> in Sydney. He also had a loss&hyphen;making paper in those days called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. He was able to go off and purchase newspapers in Britain and the United States and build up his global media empire. When he started investing overseas, he was much smaller than Mr Packer is today. Look at the Seven Network: it has recently made a major acquisition in the United States in MGM. Channel 7 is much smaller than Mr Packer is today. This argument that Mr Packer has to swallow more of our media assets so that he can look for opportunities offshore is completely bogus. It is an argument that I hope government members will put to the strongest possible questioning. The clear statements from Mr Stokes and others is that this is an argument that simply does not hold water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I finish, I would like to say that a few of us, including the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), have been through these debates before. The debate that took place during the last parliament was probably one of the most important decisions that the Keating Labor government made during its time in office. A loophole emerged in the cross&hyphen;media ownership rules that if people were not in control they could build up their cross&hyphen;media shareholdings. We asked the Australian Broadcasting Authority for a report on that loophole. The loophole meant that Mr Packer was able to get more than 15 per cent of Fairfax, as long as he could not be proven to be exercising control. We got independent advice from the ABA. The ABA recommended that we return to the clear number of no more than 15 per cent. That is what we did when we were challenged: we restored the strength of those cross&hyphen;media rules because they are important to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know the pressures that are placed on governments and members when these interests are being discussed and debated. I simply say that I respect the strength and courage which has been shown by a number of members of the government who have spoken out publicly on this very important issue. I hope that, when this debate reaches a conclusion in future months, we will be able to say that, in Australia, no one person can own a television station and a major newspaper in one of our capital cities. I hope at the end of the day we can say that, in Australia, we have kept the integrity of those cross&hyphen;media ownership laws so that we have made sure that debates in Australia are still carried out and reported by a media which is as diverse as possible, given the very high concentration that we already have in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very important that we do not allow the media in Australia to get even more concentrated than it is today. It was one of the most important issues considered by the last government and it will be one of the most important issues discussed by this government. I think it will be one issue which will tell whether Mr Howard has the courage and the strength 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3616"> that he showed on gun ownership. It will show whether he is willing to carry that over and show some courage and strength on an issue that affects Mr Packer, and affects the way parliaments and politics are debated in Australia. It is an issue that I think is going to be very important for the future of our country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Taking up where the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) left off, I most certainly would express my very strong opposition to any moves that would allow further concentration of media ownership in Australia. It would be hard to point out a single other country on earth where some 75 per cent of what is read and seen is owned by three people or, arguably, just two people. That is not a healthy democracy; that is a very unhealthy democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all due respect to the member for Dobell, I think that there was a little dodging, ducking and weaving on the issue of who was responsible for what. Both <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rise and Rise of Kerry Packer</EMPHASIS>, which is a very famous book in Australia, and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Bold Riders</EMPHASIS>, which is another very famous book which talks about the so&hyphen;called `corporate cowboys' of the 1980s, both delineate that the moves engineered by Mr Keating and Senator Richardson resulted in the two magnates, Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch, making over $2,000 million. The difference in the value of their shares prior to the media ownership changes and after the media ownership changes was some $2,000 million: a very cogent argument for having destroyed and torn a big hole in the democracy of Australia! I would not like to see this government walk down the same pathway. I pay tribute to the opposition spokesman, who is taking quite a courageous stand on this issue, and a very good one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said those things, I would also like to pay tribute, which is called for here because we are talking about cross&hyphen;ownership today, to Margot Kingston. It took a lot of courage to take an open stand as she has done. If the ball bounces the other way, I think she will be looking for another job fairly speedily. I admire courage and integrity. In North Queensland, we have been very blessed with people of great courage and integrity in our media, and Alex Rainey, John Nutting and Kirsty Alfredson are three people who leap to my mind and are associated with the ABC. Whilst the ABC is not involved in what we are talking about today, the preservation of that institution standing upright gives a diversity of ownership that is desperately needed in this country, particularly in light of the damage that was done to democracy in this country by the previous Prime Minister. I am pleased to hear that the Labor party has supposedly changed its spots. We wonder if they would be taking the same position, if they were in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking about these things and about licensing, I think that all of us would agree with the proposal before the House with respect to the licensing charges to television broadcasters, but I cannot speak about this issue without raising some ancillary problems that exist, and I am very pleased that the Minister representing the Minister for Communications is in the House. In one piece of monumental and almost mind&hyphen;numbing bureaucratic stupidity, not just 100 but hundreds of narrowcast licences in regional Australia were, I am told, handed out to a single person for a charge of $20 per licence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have tried to buy those licences, and the same person is charging&mdash;and has been paid, I am informed&mdash;many thousands of dollars for those licences. One person told me that the person said that he wanted $20,000 for the licence. It is a piece of absolutely extraordinary incompetence that anyone could have been responsible for this. You may say that we cannot redress without providing compensation, but this is such an absolutely outrageous case that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3617"> the person concerned could not possibly apply for compensation if other narrowcast licences are issued over those same towns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where the rubber meets the road here is that regional broadcasters throughout outback Queensland would have liked to have got some of those licences so that they could put TAB services into those towns. For tiny towns of 1,000 or 2,000 people, they were being asked for $20,000 from a person who had filled out a form and put up $20. It received, I am told, most certainly over 100 of these licences throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was a lovely little windfall. If we are talking about $10,000 per licence, then this person made a million dollars out of a few days work filling out the necessary forms and putting up $20 per licence. It is a most extraordinary event. The fact that it has not been rectified is beyond belief, as far as I am concerned. I refer this case to the Minister for Communications and the Arts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of providing licences for some of these small towns, the bureaucracy controlling this area is not taking a sensible and flexible approach to the granting of these licences. With the proposal before the House that owners of radio stations now be able to have an interest in newspapers, there has to be some flexibility and sense built into the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That particularly applies in country Queensland where we had the ridiculous situation where none of the locally owned radio stations could get the licence to provide the TAB service to the people. We went for three years without that. When the bureaucracy eventually got around to making a decision on that, it gave the TAB of Queensland exclusive rights to that coverage, thus tearing a big hole in the little locally&hyphen;owned regional radio stations throughout Queensland. I do not think good judgment was exercised there at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further issue on the subject of television is that television broadcasters pay a common fee. They pay a licence fee to the government, but really what the government has given them is a monopoly that is controlled by three people. That is an enormously powerful asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not be hypocritical enough to say that we should listen to Mr Hilmer, but it seems to me that the decision makers in this place take their riding instructions from him. It seems to me that those riding instruction are always the wrong ones&mdash;they do not take the good ones. However, if we were to take the principles of those policies seriously three people would not be given the licence to print money through the ownership of these three licences. The most common fee paid by the TV broadcasters is very low compared with the enormous benefits that flow from the three&hyphen;man ownership of this Australian monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That monopoly was produced by the decision making of the people opposite when they were in government. They stand condemned for moving towards the situation we have today where we have three networks, and regional television has almost ceased to exist in Australia. It has been destroyed. As our image of ourselves in regional Australia has been destroyed, so too has the soul of the people of regional Australia. Members opposite can take responsibility for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent survey of young people in Australia asked them to list the 20 most famous people they knew of and looked up to in Australia. Not one Australian was listed amongst the 20 people that they knew of and looked up to. That is a direct result of the networks we have that buy programs from overseas and thus project an image to these young people of overseas 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3618"> people. Our image of ourselves is lost completely, and with it a very large proportion of our sovereignty, and that will have disastrous consequences for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in canvassing these issues today there are two other issues that need to be addressed and I would be doing a great disservice to the people of Kennedy if I did not address them. In the western towns of Queensland, while some of those towns can pick up the satellite pay television, most of the people there have mean incomes that are so low that it would be very difficult for them to pay for pay television and the vast bulk of those towns cannot get pay television anyway. There needs to be some flexibility built into the system to allow us to take the pay television signal down to earth and relay it. There are some new technologies that will allow that but in my discussions with the licensing authority for Australia, I really have had a very large level of ignorance and a very low level of helpfulness so I would have to speak with some criticism of the officials and the department in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue relating to television licensing that we are discussing here today is the fact that all of those western towns in Queensland can receive channel 7 and channel 9 albeit without the advertising. There are little gaps in there and we just have a blank television screen where the advertising should be. But in places where we have very few recreational pursuits&mdash;entertainment is a better word&mdash;available to us then television becomes a very important entertainment resource to us. We have no local picture theatres, we have no theatre&mdash;not that too many people would go to theatre&mdash;we have none of those things in these country towns and yet we do have channel 9 and channel 7. The existing laws do not allow us to pick up those television broadcasts and there is just no reason or logic attached to that. There was in days past when channel 0 was up on the satellite by itself and put a very special satellite service into regional Australia. Maybe there needs to be some protection for that but really the way the situation is working at the present moment, I would find it very difficult to argue against the people's right to be able to take the channel 9 and channel 7 service that they can get right now. But they are not allowed to because of the laws that exist in Australia. A person in Brisbane is able to get the four channels but a person in Julia Creek is only able to get one channel and that is channel 0.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In days past, there was a full television crew out in Mount Isa. I do not wish to criticise channel 0 and the people that are in Mount Isa today work very hard but it is no longer a proper journalist set&hyphen;up where the journalists go all over the countryside picking up news items from western Queensland. That situation no longer exists in central Queensland or in the mid&hyphen;west of north Queensland. The arguments that existed before are not there today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, an excellent charitable institution in the state of Queensland operates in my electorate and they unfortunately got caught as one of the COT cases. When we talk about communications and fairness to everybody&mdash;as we are talking here about fairness to everybody by allowing a regional newspaper to go into towns and the television broadcaster's most common fee&mdash;we are trying to establish laws that are fair to everybody. There are some really dreadful problems in there with the big institutions. If there is any watering down of the media ownership rules and the ownership of the media becomes more centralised, we then have huge institutions that become not only unreactive but enormously oppressive. In this terrible case, it was admitted in the Senate estimates that $7 million has been spent fighting 20 or 30 of these COT cases, one of whom is a charitable institution in the state of Queensland, looking after crippled children. When institutions get big, not only do they become unreactive, but they also become oppressive.</PARA>

They have been agreed to by the opposition and I gave detailed second reading speeches in the chamber some time ago. We are pleased that the opposition has joined us and that these bills will go through. I might make a few remarks about some of the things that were discussed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) talked about the issue with regard to on&hyphen;line services. That is not part of this legislative package. I want to point out to the Main Committee that the issues that he was talking about are in a piece of legislation that has been introduced into the Senate and is yet to come to this place. His remarks, all the same, were well made on access to Internet and protection. How one might limit access to some of the activities that one might find on the Internet is an issue that each member in this place would be concerned about. Most certainly, the government is and the minister is as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that he made, and he did wander a little, was about the cross&hyphen;media ownership change in this piece of legislation that relates to an uninfluential newspaper being in the same market as a radio station. This amendment is designed to correct that position, primarily in Ipswich in Queensland, and he accepts that. He went on to make other comments about cross&hyphen;media ownership and related those back to 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some regard for the member for Dobell. He was a former minister and did chair a rather well&hyphen;known committee into media law. His comments are noted, but he would not expect me to comment on those matters other than to say that these are issues actively being considered by the government at this time. There have been comments made by many and sundry. I am sure that will continue. That is the nature of the debate which is being held but the government, once it has fully consulted within the government and with all its members and more broadly in the community, will make a decision in the broader public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) made a well&hyphen;informed contribution about these matters. Some of those issues of a technical nature relating to signal access, the impact of localism and so on have been taken up by my colleagues from the department who are here. They will be able to address some of those issues more directly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You made one point about narrowcast licensing. I was not aware of that issue. I would make the point that narrowcast licensing is somewhat qualitatively different to radio licensing in that they receive what is known as a transmitter licence from the Spectrum Management Agency and attract a cost recovery fee. I do not recall what the limitations are under the act, even though I was the one who brought it into the parliament in about 1991 on behalf of the opposition. I am sure that matter will be subject to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) reviewing some of the issues with the SMA later this year or in 1998. That matter will, I am sure, be taken up and answered to your satisfaction. I thank you for drawing that matter to our attention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the opposition have already indicated to the government, we are quite comfortable with the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill. It carries through further stages of the reforms of the dairy industry which began under our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3621"> administration and continues that thrust, so we have indicated that the passage of the bill will not face opposition from us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a few observations that I would like to make in respect of the dairy industry and my colleague the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) will be following me in making some comments. It is worth pointing out that, whilst this bill provides for an increase in the levy to be paid to the Australian Animal Health Council to ensure that the AAHC and the system around it is capable of maintaining and furthering Australia's animal health standards, the legislation does not provide at this point for an increase in the levy. It simply makes it possible for the industry to apply to the government for the right to do this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would say to the industry is that when it comes to the point that they are looking for an increase in the levy, and knowing full well that such an increase is accompanied by a government matching contribution&mdash;don't hold your breath. From what I have seen from the fine print of last night's budget, particularly in the allocation to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the allocations are all on the downward slope, not the upward slope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one thing we will have to be cognisant of&mdash;and I put the government on notice now on this matter&mdash;if we are to proceed with the extraordinary rate of progress that has been made in this industry. I note from current statistics that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has provided in the second reading speech that we have now reached production levels of nine billion litres of milk per year in the dairy industry and we now have exports of the order of 50 per cent of that production. Assuming that we are now in the stage where those exports are profitable, it should be remembered that when Labor's reform of the dairy industry began back in the mid&hyphen;1980s, much of Australia's export produce from the dairy industry was significantly subsidised by the domestic consumer. We have now turned that around and are on a forward path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key point I make about that is that the science is vital. I think that is well understood by the farm community. It is understood by government, I hope. So when it does come to the point that the industry is proposing an increase in the levy and that means, therefore, an increase in the budget allocation to that science to ensure that the Animal Health Council and the research that flows off it is available, then there should be no penny&hyphen;pinching about this on the part of the Treasurer (Mr Costello).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to foreshadow a concern that, given the trend of budget provisions, particularly as they affect primary industry, this does not sound as straightforward and as easy to win as we might think. So, it is on notice to the government as one of the matters we will be committing to because we want to emphasise the importance of this commitment to research and development of science in the development of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am speaking about the dairy industry, I could not avoid making some observations on some of the allocations in the budget announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) last night. They pertained very relevantly to people in the dairy industry. The first thing I want to make an observation about is what I call the `great savings con'. What we saw announced last night was that a previously committed and opposition guaranteed contribution to the incomes of farmers and farmworkers in the form of superannuation contributions to be made by the government, has been snatched away. And it is interesting to note that an ordinary farmworker about 30 years of age working through to age 60, be it a dairy farmworker on wages around the level that dairy farmworkers get&mdash;and we all know what they are&mdash;would have received 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3622"> a government contribution in the order of about $100,000. Instead, what has been offered has been snatched away&mdash;</PARA>

It is Australia's quarantine standards and the level to which we protect the dairy stock and develop it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another one of the great hoaxes presented in last night's budget and all over the press this morning is the claim that we are actually increasing funding for quarantine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well, yes we are. If you go to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy's budget, you will find that it has been cut. The funds are being made up from&mdash;guess where?&mdash;the world's greatest environment package. A one-off lump sum that was promised for the environment is now being milked to cover up a range of substantial funding cuts which will have to be redefended. This is the point I make. It will have to be redefended.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3623">

At some point, new funds are going to have to be fought for and they will not be there.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, as I am making the point here, we are seeing the great savings con. We are seeing the funding of the primary industry budget off the back of a broken promise. We are seeing no prospect whatsoever of funding being available in the budget of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to support an increase in the dairy produce levy, unless the members opposite are saying to us now and to the dairy industry, `Yes, when you want it, it will be there'. It will be there by poaching more from the world's greatest environment fund or we think somehow we can win the case against the Treasurer who has been ripping the heart out of funding to rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will explore this as we go down the track. As I said, the member for Corio and I have recently visited the region of Gippsland in Victoria and looked specifically at the dairy industry. The member for Corio will tell you about the factories that we visited and the dairy produce issues that we have looked at.

I call on it to rethink the slashing of funds in country regions. I call on government members opposite to get in there and turn around this great savings hoax. I call on them to give the dairy farmers and their workers back their superannuation contributions, knowing that they will never have any savings to qualify for the great savings hoax. The only people who have money to qualify for the great savings hoax in the farm sector are the corporates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum up, the opposition is perfectly relaxed with this legislation in the form that it is in, but I foreshadow to the dairy industry and to members opposite that I can see very clearly that we are providing for the industry to apply for an increase in the levy. The levy is vital to the science behind the research on the future wellbeing of the dairy herd in Australia&mdash;there is no question about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the hook behind all this is that, under current arrangements, there is a dollar for dollar subsidy off&hyphen;budget for any increase in the levy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) and I must admit that I found his speech totally confusing and his logic convoluted. I can understand why he is part of the opposition. If the only contribution he can make to this debate is to make spurious claims about things that really do not make much sense, then I guess he will spend a long time in opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking to the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill, I endorse the words of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). He talked about the importance of this levy and the importance of ensuring that Australia's animal health service system is capable of maintaining acceptable national animal health standards which meet both consumer needs and market requirements in domestic and international markets. As he went on to point out, the Animal Health Service is jointly funded and jointly owned by the states and the Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is about raising the ceiling on the amount of levy that can be charged on the dairy industry. It is not actually about raising the levy per se, but it does recognise that the current level of levy is very close to the previous maximum research levy rate and, therefore, it is important to allow that flexibility and scope for an industry that chooses to increase its contribution to research to be able to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was amazed by the extraordinary insinuations that the member for Burke came up with, suggesting that, if the dairy industry actually increased its contributions, he was not sure that the government would match it. That is a load of nonsense. He then went on with some 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3625"> convoluted logic about finding the money from part of the budget, but not the part of the budget that he said it should find it from. Again, that seems to be utter nonsense. Really, we expected better from him in his contribution to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also make some reference in passing to the fact that the member for Burke made another extraordinary claim about the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) by saying that he had made no comment about the current seasonal difficulties that are facing dairy farmers in his region. I can say that I happened to hear on the radio in the last couple of weeks the member for Gippsland drawing attention to that very fact. I suggest to the member for Burke that he ought to do a bit more research and that he ought to do his homework instead of coming in here and making absolutely nonsensical statements which only go to show one thing: how totally ignorant he is about the whole issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that we ought to draw attention to is that in last night's budget there was a tremendous announcement about the whole question of quarantine and the contribution that the Commonwealth is making to quarantine. This very much reinforces the government's commitment to the dairy industry, because we all know how important it is to have a really first class quarantine service that will in fact ensure that, when we talk about animal health and about reaping the benefits of the research from such things as the dairy produce levy, they do not in fact get lost because we have not maintained the world's best quarantine standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That contribution is very welcome. It is a very big plus and it shows, most significantly, that we have a government that recognises how important it is in primary industries&mdash;and the dairy industry in particular&mdash;to ensure that we do maintain very high standards. I commend the minister for that initiative. I believe that it shows again that the government is very much in touch with the needs of the dairy industry and also very much recognises that we have to maintain the highest standards possible and not allow industries such as the dairy industry to risk the importation of some disease that could put at risk not only our domestic consumers but also our very significant export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now take up some of the issues that the minister talked about in his second reading speech. He spoke about the significant growth in recent years in the dairy industry, with milk production in the current financial year expected to exceed nine billion litres for the first time on record, which is a tremendous achievement. But, as he pointed out, half of this production will be exported, with the value of exports expected to be about $1.8 billion. That is a fantastic achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will expand on those comments of the minister and talk about them from the local perspective of, in particular, the south&hyphen;west area of Victoria&mdash;which I have the great honour to represent and which is also shared by my colleague and good friend the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). What we have seen in the dairy industry in the south&hyphen;west corner of Victoria is enormous changes over the past 80 years, and what we are now looking at is a very significant industry that makes very significant contributions not only to the economy of Victoria but also to the economy of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian dairy industry is now producing about 62 per cent of Australia's milk; but, better and more significant than that, is the fact that it is also producing about 85 per cent of Australia's dairy exports. The Victorian dairy industry is the state's largest decentralised industry, adding about $5 billion to the economy. As I have pointed out already, Victoria is the largest dairying state. We have more dairy farmers, more dairy cows, more milk produced and more butter, cheese and milk powder manufactured than in all other states combined. In 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3626"> fact, the south&hyphen;west diary industry, which is just one part of Victoria, is larger than the combined dairy industries of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania, and the flow&hyphen;on benefits to local industries and to the local economy are enormous. But not only that: it is a very efficient industry. As the Boston Consulting Group found in 1993, our dairy industry is among the producers of lowest&hyphen;cost milk, by world standards, and we rank alongside New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the contribution that dairy farmers make to the community is very significant. The average farmer spends around $2,400 a week on farm input and services. This has a major impact in a local community. The growth that has been achieved by farmers in the region is very impressive. Over the last 10 years, Victorian dairy herds have increased almost 40 per cent to average 143 cows per dairy. They are forecast to average around 200 cows in four to five years time. These are fantastic achievements. This is fantastic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing to note about the dairy industry in Australia is that the production per cow over the last 25 years has literally doubled. I listened to an eminent scientist talking about this who went on to suggest that not only has that been achieved; there is also an expectation that production will double again over the next 25 years. It really is an industry that has a very proud record of achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also significant to note the input to the local community. For every 100 jobs in the dairy industry, there are another 110 created in associated activities. To put it another way, for every dollar of farm output, there is another $2.80 worth of goods and services created as a result of dairy processing and associated activities. As a result, in the south&hyphen;west region of Victoria, the dairy industry is responsible for the employment of around 10,000 people. South&hyphen;west Victoria produces around 30 per cent of Victoria's milk from around 2,000 herds and under 400,000 cows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing to note is the sheer size of investment in the region. This is an industry of great significance, but also an industry of confidence. Recently we have seen Bonlac spend $50 million at Cobden in my electorate. We have seen Murray&hyphen;Goulburn spend $35 million at Koroit in my electorate. Warrnambool Cheese and Butter is spending around $50 million over five years in their expansion. Nestle, also in Warrnambool, is undergoing a $30 million expansion. These are big investments and they show that this industry has significant confidence and is a major contributor, not only to my region of the state of Victoria, but also to the whole state and, indeed, to the whole nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clean and green reputation of this region puts the local dairy industry in a prime position to make the most of opportunities in the increasing export demand in Asia. It is worth noting just how significant this export demand is. As the Asian region becomes more affluent and seeks alternatives, such as more dairy products, we are seeing that the opportunities are enormous. For example, while the average Japanese currently eats 1&half; kilograms of cheese per year, this is expected to increase to 2&half; kilograms by the year 2000. That will mean an additional 120,000 tonnes in exports and it is obvious that much of this will come from Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing to pay tribute to is the dairy community, which has shown that it can respond to challenges. These people are not waiting for it to happen; they are working to make it happen. We have seen the challenges that will be there for the future. We obviously have to continue to seek new export markets and that is being done. We still have to deal, as a national government, with attacking some of the problems of the incentive programs&mdash;as they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3627"> are called by other countries, such as the United States&mdash;and how we can best make sure that, through the World Trade Organisation, our dairy farmers are not disadvantaged by some of the trade barriers that still exist in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, if you look at our share of the world dairy trade, it has more than tripled since the 1980s. It has gone from three per cent to 10 per cent. It is quite an impressive record. In fact, I would suggest it is an extremely impressive record and one that all Australians ought to be made more aware of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, despite all the opportunities in Asia, if the Australian dairy industry continues to increase at its current rate, our market share in Asia will actually decline. In other words, while we are continuing to improve our performance and the volume and value of our exports, the opportunities are so great that we are going to have difficulty in meeting those opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing to note about the region is that in 1977 there were 8,500 dairy farms in the region. Twenty years later&mdash;this year&mdash;that figure has dropped by around 6,000 but, despite this, productivity has continued to increase by about three per cent per year. I think it is also worth looking at some of the ways that the industry has not only made these great strides but is continuing to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look, for example, at some of the ways that the south&hyphen;west is positioning itself for the 21st century we will see a number of things that I think are very impressive. For example, under the property management planning funding we will see local farmsmart coordinators being appointed. They will work with the dairy farmers and with risk managers to look at the best ways of risk management to cope with some of the unavoidable seasonal difficulties. This is the positive way that the local dairy farmers are setting about to look at some of the difficulties that the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) seemed to want to dwell on so much. Rather than taking his negative, pessimistic view, they are looking forward and taking a positive approach to see how they can better improve their lot and manage those sorts of risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the WestVic Dairy, which has several projects running looking at both the scientific and the human side of the industry. We have seven Focus Farms up and running between Swan Marsh and across to Mount Gambier in South Australia, and the information that is gained from these farms is being transferred through support farmers and to the communities. We have the Target 10 program, which is all about increasing pasture productivity and optimising pasture development&mdash;again a very significant project. We have the farmsmart program and we also have the Demo Dairy which was recently set up just outside Terang. That is another example of just how the dairy industry can in fact ensure itself that it is doing the very things that are needed to improve the productivity and consolidate the position of the dairy industry in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as that, there has been an enormous amount of work undertaken by the United Dairy Farmers of Victoria, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the WestVic Dairy&mdash;as I mentioned&mdash;and Glenormiston Agricultural College and the South West College of TAFE are in the region. All of these factors are ensuring that we have a strong, vibrant, healthy, growing industry that is taking up the challenges of the future and is not sitting back saying `Look what we have achieved so far' because they recognise that they have to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the interesting spin&hyphen;offs, or side developments, is the Acme field days. Here again is an example of this region taking up the challenge in the dairy industry and building a very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3628"> successful field day. It only started 15 years ago and has gone from 20 exhibits in the first year to 450 this year. I was very proud to have the opportunity to open these field days because I think they are one of the highlights of the agricultural agenda of the year in my region. From around 600 visitors in the first year the number now exceeds 20,000 at the field days&mdash;it is now the biggest dairy field day in Australia and is also recognised internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the sorts of achievements that have been going on in my region. I cannot overlook the achievements of the Warrnambool cheese and butter factory itself, a cooperative that has been extremely successful and has moved with the times. As I mentioned earlier, it is in the process of undergoing a $50 million expansion. Some of that has already been done but in five years that is a tremendous achievement. The Warrnambool cheese and butter factory began in 1888 and it has expanded every year. The new expansion that it has just announced is going to serve 600 suppliers. That is an example of a cooperative that can actually make sure that it is not only in tune with today's needs but is planning for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the dairy industry in my region, in fact in Australia, is an industry that has been one of the quiet achievers in the Australian economy. It has been a quiet achiever because it is made up of people who want to get on and make the future happen rather than just letting it happen. Therefore this bill, which allows the opportunity for the industry to increase its efforts into research, is to be commended. It quite clearly shows that the dairy industry has recognised the value of the research which, of course, is matched on a dollar for dollar basis by the Commonwealth government, and it recognises the importance of increasing that effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, it recognises that if an industry is to be able to continue to be competitive and to expand into markets in Asia, in particular, and elsewhere, it has to have access to the best research it can afford. I commend the industry for being forward looking in this. I believe that its contribution to the Australian economy will continue to grow. Most significantly, I believe that the south&hyphen;west dairy region of Victoria&mdash;in my electorate&mdash;is going to continue to be a leader in the dairy industry in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dairy farmers throughout the length and breadth of this country will tell you that it was the Kerin plan that set up the prosperity of the Australian dairy industry, followed by the Crean plan, and supplemented by the measures of Labor governments. Those are the things that have propelled this industry to the forefront of rural industry in this nation today. I can understand that the sheep man over there, the honourable member for Corangamite&mdash;I stood against him in 1984 for the seat of Corangamite&mdash;is a bit testy on this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you a bit of history, Mr Deputy Speaker. In the 1984 campaign, John Kerin and I went into the Heytesbury settlement, which was then in the electorate of Corangamite but is now in the electorate of the honourable member for Wannon. We went to a meeting of dairy farmers in the Heytesbury shire hall. They had been stirred up by the honourable member for Corangamite and his cohorts in the Liberal Party. Indeed, if they had had a rope there that day, they probably would have hanged us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We delivered a fairly blunt message to them but it was a visionary message and one that has set the industry up for the prosperity that it enjoys today. We simply said to them, `We don't like the fact that over the next 10 to 15 years many dairy farmers are going to be restructured out of this industry. But there is a window of opportunity and you have to restructure and prepare yourself for the competition that is going to come from New Zealand and from the changes that are going to occur in the domestic and the international marketing environments.' We were opposed at that time bitterly by the honourable member for Corangamite and his cohorts, the rural Liberals, throughout the length and breadth of Victoria. If we had not had the vision, the political commitment and the will to restructure this industry, the prosperity that it enjoys today would simply not be there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the facts of the matter. Looking at 13 years of Labor government, not only did we introduce the great plans that restructured and repositioned this industry for the prosperity that it enjoys today, but we were the government that opened up the international marketplace where previous coalition administrations had failed miserably. We were the government that provided the labour market assistance programs that saw 1,000 dairy industry traineeships raised under the Working Nation program. It is the present government which has taken that away from the dairy industry in Victoria and the dairy industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Wannon has the temerity and the gall, if I might be so presumptuous&mdash;without going outside the bounds of propriety in this debate&mdash;to mention the Demo Dairy. The Demo Dairy in his electorate was funded under the regional development program that was abolished by the Howard government in its first budget. The one initiative that he stands up for in this particular chamber, where he says to the dairy farmers of Australia, `What a magnificent initiative this is,' we funded in the previous Labor government. His government abolished the very scheme under which we funded it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WU5">Mr O'CONNOR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Don't you, member for Corangamite, as an old sheep man from the Western District, come and tell me about your great interest in the dairy farmers of your particular constituency. We knew all about that in 1984 when you opposed the very measures 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3630"> that have now brought the industry to the prosperity that it enjoys. You opposed it bitterly. You stirred the farmers up at that particular time against the government of the day that was trying to put a plan in place to guarantee the prosperity of those farmers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when you get up to speak about how good this industry is and how important it is to the Victorian economy, how important it is to the regions of Australia and how significant it is to the export effort, at least have the decency to say that it was a Labor government that put the industry plan in place. Have the humility for once in your political life to get up in this place and say, `I was wrong; I was wrong to oppose the plan at the time; I was wrong to stir up the dairy farmers in the Western District against the candidate for Corangamite'&mdash;me at the time&mdash;`and the then Labor minister, John Kerin.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said to you, we were lucky to get out of Heytesbury alive at that time. It was due in no small part to the way we persuasively argued to the dairy farmers that it was in their interests to come on board with us and not listen to the prophets of doom floating around the Western District at that time. I hope the honourable member for Corangamite, who is in this chamber, does take my advice and get on his feet today to congratulate me and, of course, the then minister, John Kerin, for the excellent plans that we had, and then have the humility to say, `I was wrong.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with what is being said by the honourable member for Wannon and no doubt it will be reiterated by the honourable member for Corangamite. The dairy industry is one of the brighter spots in the rural production landscape.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an industry which has undergone significant adjustment over the past 20 or 30 years. The farms are fewer, and the farmers are fewer, but the farms are producing more milk than they did in the 1970s. That structural adjustment has resulted from the introduction of new technologies and reduced levels of assistance over time that have forced the industry into looking for greater efficiencies and greater productivities. Those structural adjustments have been brought about also by changes in domestic and international marketing environments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to this position with personal experience as the son of a dairy farmer in the Western District who knows quite intimately the process of structural adjustment that has occurred in this industry over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall past days&mdash;as does the honourable member for Corangamite; we were reminiscing over in the corner. He is a sheep man now but he assures me that in his younger days he did the same thing as I did&mdash;milked the cows by hand. The herds were small, the farms were small and the output was delivered to the factories in cans. The production of fodder on farms was done by a lot of labour associated with that dairy farming operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my father's day and in my day on the farm in the Western District, the great technological innovation was milking machines. The government of the day, which was a Liberal government, actually gave a subsidy to dairy farmers to put in stainless steel vats to assist in the storage of milk on farms before its collection. Times have changed. If you go to a dairy farm today there is massive capital investment in new technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the particular area in which our farm was situated, the surrounding farms have been amalgamated into one farm and a rotolactor dairy now milks around 350 cows in an irrigated farm operation which is extremely productive. If you look at the production of fodder on farm, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3631"> you will see that a lot of that can be done now by one or two people with the fodder being stored in round bales on the farm and being produced with heavy equipment. Times have really changed in this industry and massive increases in productivity have come with the changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the outlook for the industry, generally it is projected to expand over the medium term in response to rising world demand, especially in South&hyphen;East Asia. The outlook for the industry comes off the back of the improved skills of dairy farmers and it comes off the back of improved herds and breeding programs and the introduction of new capital equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the manufactured milk sector is concerned, there is a positive outlook in that sector. Growth in milk production, which has been alluded to already in the debate, will be used mainly in the manufacture of butter, cheese, milk products, milk powders and other milk products. Unfortunately, the sales of market milk are not forecast to rise dramatically, but the big growth will be in the sales of manufactured milk and in the export of cheeses and other milk powders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We look also to the spectacular exporting performance of this industry. We note also that exports are expected to rise in the medium to longer term. That reflects the increase in production which has taken place in the dairy industry today, the relatively small demand that will be generated in the domestic market and, more particularly, the spectacular growth which is predicted in the South&hyphen;East Asian market for manufactured milk products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important impact the dairying industry has on key regional areas in Australia and in my state of Victoria has already been alluded to in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dairy industry does provide direct employment on farms. It is a source of extensive value added employment in country areas in the Western District, Gippsland and Goulburn Valley, with the great manufacturing production cooperatives and, of course, it is an important source of private investment. We have seen the trend to small value adding on farms. I was at the recent alternative farm vision expo in Geelong and one of the winners in that expo was a small concern producing specialty cheeses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the industry faces challenging external conditions in the longer term. It still faces heavy competition from New Zealand, from the policies of the European Union with its heavily subsidised cheese exports, and from the US farm support programs which provide subsidised exports into our traditional markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Burke alluded to the fact that he and I had recently visited a very important dairy production area in Gippsland in the state of Victoria. We met with local farm representatives in the Morwell area who have been experiencing severe drought conditions. They have experienced abnormal rain patterns and this has meant that farmers have not been able to harvest fodder on farms, fodder stocks in the region are nearly exhausted and external sources of fodder are drying up as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I gave a commitment to the dairy farmers of that area that I would raise this matter on the floor of the parliament to see if we could excite the interest of the federal minister, as the state minister for agriculture had not even paid the dairy farmers of Gippsland the courtesy of visiting there in a time of desperate need for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some farmers in the Gippsland region are spending upwards of $1,000 a day to maintain fodder supplies for their herds and they are going into debt to do this. The herds in the area are in danger as a result of the climatic conditions that have existed there and the situation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3632"> will not really be improved by the breaking of the drought. The existing provisions of the national drought policy do not permit the exceptional circumstance provisions of the scheme to be brought to bear in the case of the Gippsland farmers. There is, however, a strong case for assistance to be provided on the basis of the severity of the crisis that these dairy farmers are facing and the rare climatic circumstances that have prevailed up to this time. Despite the recent rains, the problems for these farmers still exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effects of this situation have been heavy financial burdens falling on dairy farmers in that region and a rundown in the quality of their herds. Sharefarmers have walked off properties and rural businesses in the Gippsland towns have been affected. As a result, there is a severe adverse regional economic impact pending in the Gippsland area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I mention that in the hope that the Victorian agriculture minister takes another look at the plight being faced by the Gippsland dairy farmers and, perhaps with the federal minister, engage in some discussions as to how the plight of these farmers, and others who face rare and exceptional circumstances, can be accommodated within the ambit of the national drought scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I visited the Goulburn Valley and met with a local UDV representative, Alan Burgess, and I discussed with him a range of issues related to dairy farmers in his region. Those matters ranged across features of local production; competition in the manufactured milk sector in the region; the recent anthrax outbreak in the Goulburn Valley; the supply of quality water for manufacturing milk production; health and education issues affecting farmers; research and development funding, and the need to constantly work on improvement to costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, most interestingly, what featured in our discussion was the manner in which the dairy industry in Victoria had utilised labour market programs under the previous Labor government. They had raised 1,000 dairy industry traineeships in the past three years. The industry has recognised the importance of having a stream of skilled young people coming into the industry and assisting in its productivity improvements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These positions were abolished, as I mentioned earlier, by the first Howard budget when it cut $1.8 billion from labour market programs, and it has cut further labour market assistance in the current budget. I will not dwell on the matters in the budget that will affect the dairy farmers because the Deputy Speaker who sat in the chair previously did get a bit testy when these issues were raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will return once again to the basic proposition that I started with, that coalition members get up in this parliament and talk till they are blue in the face about what a great economic state this industry is in and what a magnificent contribution it makes to the Victorian regional economy, to the national economy and to the national export effort. The member for Corangamite, do yourself and your party and the parliament the courtesy of getting up now and acknowledging the plans that were implemented by Labor governments that have brought prosperity to this industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in this cognate debate on the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill and the Australian Animal Health Council (Live-stock Industries) Funding Amendment Bill. However, before the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) leaves the chamber, he might listen to what I have to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted that the member for Corio could take the shadow minister to Gippsland and show him a real live dairy farm so that the shadow minister might understand the industry. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3633"> At least I will concede the point that the member for Corio understands the industry, having been brought up in it, having participated in it in his early years, having grown onions and having been part of a very fertile farm at Alvie, near Colac. We are delighted that the member for Corio, who has no dairy farmers in his electorate, has been good enough to take the shadow minister to see the real and genuine conditions of the dairy industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I would like to put on the record is that I broadly agreed with the Kerin plan and I refute the claim by the member for Corio that I was against it. I draw to his attention the fact that whilst he was lucky to get out alive from the Heytesbury shire hall at his meeting with Minister Kerin, I likewise was lucky to get out alive on two occasions in the Colac hall after meetings with the UDV. Some of the views presented there were very strongly held by members of the UDV and dairy farmers in that region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, the Kerin plan basically had the concept correct. The plan was that the dairy industry should export to those markets that provided a competitive price and that the fresh milk market was no longer the be all and end all of the dairy industry. Like the member for Corio, I battled long and hard to bring about a better export focus for the dairy industry. I have said on the public record that I agreed with the Kerin plan and, in general, I fought a battle with members of the UDV at that time as they campaigned to maintain a protected domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Corio would recall those arguments quite well. Mr Kerin fought a lengthy battle, particularly with the state of Victoria and with those farmers who wished to maintain the fresh milk market premium rather than sell on the overseas market, which at that time was not all that lucrative. I refute the claim that I did not support the Kerin plan. I have put on the record my support for the Kerin plan and its eventual outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I draw a distinction between Mr Kerin and the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). The member for Hotham considered himself to be an outward looking minister in the previous government but has had a turnaround on the tariff debate in recent times. The member for Hotham has completely changed his former free trading approach to the dairy industry, the TCF industry and the car industry. He has been converted to an internal, high wall tariff supporter when formerly he was very strongly supporting lowering the tariff position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the member for Corio to get himself on the record as to where he stands on these issues since he is so clearly a free-trader for the dairy industry, an industry that has to meet world market conditions&mdash;the uneven playing field of the EC producers, the uneven playing field of the Canadian producers, and the uneven playing field of the American producers who are supported by the USA taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that the member for Corio does know something about the dairy industry, unlike the shadow minister. At least the member for Corio has some hands&hyphen;on experience. I accept the view that seasonal conditions are difficult in Gippsland, but I am not sure that the former government or the current government could bring about a change in rainfall in Gippsland or in western Victoria.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was all your good work, was it? I am delighted to hear that you have such a major influence on the outcome of the dairy industry in Gippsland. This bill imposes a levy on dairy producers to fund the dairy industry's contribution to the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3634"> Animal Health Council. It doubles the maximum research levy, which may be set to fund the activities of the Dairy Research and Development Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Animal Health Council is a positive development in the formation of a national body to oversee animal health policy around Australia. As other members have mentioned, the recent anthrax outbreaks in northern Victoria highlight the need for a strong emphasis on animal health issues, especially for Australia, which has traditionally benefited from a clean, green, disease free image. We need to defend this image and make sure we have a national policy to maintain this island as genuinely disease free, in most cases, in our animal industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the hands&hyphen;on management of the disease outbreaks remains with state governments and health authorities, the Australian Animal Health Council now exists as a national policy coordinating role. I again commend that conceptual arrangement. The council is an unlisted public company, formed on 18 August 1995 by a meeting of the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I commend the attitude that it is a commercial organisation, funded in a commercial way with commercial objectives. It has a broad role to advise the industry and the government on animal health issues, to develop and maintain a national animal health information system, and to develop and manage animal health programs around Australia. Previously, as I have said, there was no national animal health body to advise and assist the Australian animal health service system to maintain acceptable national health standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The membership of the Australian Animal Health Council is comprised of the Commonwealth government, state and territory governments and industry bodies. All livestock and animal related primary industries have agreed to contribute to the funding of the organisation. I list them for the record. They are: the Chicken Meat Federation, the Egg Industry Association, the Dairy Farmers Federation, the Cattle Council of Australia, the Pork Council of Australia, the Sheep Meat Council of Australia, the Australian Horse Council and the Wool Council of Australia. Many members of the House would have had some association with those particular groups in relation to animal health problems and some of their policies with regard to imports and exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was agreed that the various industries would contribute to the Animal Health Council roughly in proportion to the numbers of livestock for which they are responsible. Up until now, the dairy industry has funded its contribution through reserves, but the industry felt that in the future the most effective way to fund its contribution was through a transparent levy on producers. I think this is an acceptable way to go, that research and development and animal health issues are funded in this way for the general good of the industry. The resolution passed by the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dairy industry should fund its contribution to the cost of financing AAHC by a levy on all farmers which would be similar to a levy applied to all farmers to operate EXANDIS&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">this was the forerunner to the AAHC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">prior to its determination on June 30th 1995.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The amount of the levy on dairy farmers will be modest. Again, I think that is important. There is always a tendency for these levies to rise. It has been estimated by the Australian Dairy Industry Council that the average dairy farmer will pay about $20 per year towards the council. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3635"> Again, I support that general concept that this would be a small amount for each dairy farmer to pay to maintain a disease free status here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the bill relates to the doubling of the maximum research levy which may be prescribed. The money raised by the research levy on the dairy corporation goes to the Dairy Research and Development Corporation for the purpose of conducting R&amp;D for the benefit of the industry as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maximum of the levy at present is 2.3c per kilogram, milk, butterfat equivalent. It had been set at or near the rate for some three or four years at the industry's request that the maximum rate be raised. Again, the industry has made the request rather than the government. There is now a realisation that we have reached a ceiling and if the Dairy Research and Development Corporation is to respond to the needs of the industry in the future, the levy must be increased modestly. The industry has requested the levy be increased so the initiative comes from the representatives of farmers and the processors themselves&mdash;again not from the government. It is important to realise that, although the maximum allowable rate of levy will be doubled, the actual levy charge will rise only slightly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have here a letter from the Chief Executive Officer of the Dairy Industry Council, Helen Dornom, to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, dated 19 June 1996, which sets out the case for the increase. She says in that letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Dairy Industry Council seeks a change in the maximum Research Levy . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ADIC has agreed to increase the legislative maxima to the equivalent of 5 cents per kg milkfat.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whilst recommending the change to the maximum, the ADIC is not at this stage foreshadowing an increase in the research levy, but simply allowing for an increase over and above the 1996&hyphen;97 research levy. According to the Australian Dairy Industry Council, they would like the levy to be set at 2.9c per kilogram, that equivalent a modest rise but one which is necessary if the Dairy Research and Development Corporation is to continue its good work. Apart from the market support levy, the research levy is the most significant paid by dairy farmers. They also pay a promotion levy for generic and domestic and overseas promotion and a corporation levy which goes to fund the Australian Dairy Corporation. These levies are considerably smaller than the research levy of 2.3c per kilogram of milk fat equivalent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I have had some reservations about promotion levies, statutory marketing arrangements and all those things&mdash;the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) would understand&mdash;I do think there is a case for the industry providing resources to protect its disease free status and encourage further research in the whole area of animal welfare and animal disease control, especially in view of the export potential from the dairy industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just add to the remarks of my good friend and colleague the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) who made some observations about the dairy industry in western Victoria, which is really a very important part of the dairy industry of Australia, with respect to my colleague from Lyne. I think we provide about half the dairy product from Australia and, over the last two decades, there have been quite remarkable changes in the way in which the dairy industry has been structured. We had some interchange with the member for Corio about the attitude of the industry in relation to the Kerin plan and there is an emphasis on the dairy industry now being an export industry with the capacity to provide very good returns to those producers without relying on the fresh milk market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3636">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reliant on the Outlook Conference of 1996 for material that I will use to make some broader observations on the industry. The number of farmers have halved over the last two decades. The number of cows are down 20 per cent and, of course, with the introduction of supplementary feeding and improved genetics, the dairy industry has improved quite remarkably. Australia and New Zealand are low cost countries in terms of production and compete very favourably with every other country around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the significant things that people tend to overlook is that we do not have the problem of a northern winter where the dairy cattle are housed for three months. Our dairy cattle have free range conditions and I think that gives us a tremendous comparative advantage and a big international comparative advantage in our ability to sell the product competitively. So Australia and New Zealand now move into the demand and supply position in terms of milk products around the world. The free trade rules under GATT and the Uruguay Round introduced in 1995 have provided that there are reductions of subsidies in northern America and in Europe, so Australian dairy farmers are now, under the Kerin plan which I acknowledge, able to compete favourably on the world market without the unlevel playing field subsidised by taxpayers in Europe and taxpayers in northern America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the observation that the dairy industry is competing on the world markets, handling the ups and downs of the price which just in recent months has dropped a little bit although long&hyphen;term expectations are encouraging. I draw the obvious comparison of this industry in the electorate of the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), in my electorate, the electorate of Wannon and in Gippsland in Victoria where they are competing on the world market, no matter what, with the automobile industry which still enjoys a tariff protection of 22 per cent and the TCF industries which enjoy protection levels of 37 per cent and are protected from the vicissitudes of international trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the comment of the member for Wannon when he was talking about the total production of nine billion litres of milk. That is a far cry from the restrictive attitudes of policy makers that we would only produce five billion litres of milk in Australia if we did not export. The attitude was that we would supply the domestic market and if we managed to do that at a profitable rate, then we would move to the export market if it suited us. The changes that have been brought about by the Hilmer competitive arrangements in terms of fresh milk again have contributed to that. This debate was going on during the 1980s when fresh milk was sold at a regulated price. Now there is a movement by all state authorities under the Hilmer competition policy that the fresh milk price will tend to be regulated over the next three or four years and will be integrated into an export price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly the liberalised trade, as I say, around the world has ensured that the dairy farmers are meeting the expectations of markets in Asia. They are getting profits out of this expanding market of South Korea, of Japan and of other emerging Asian nations that have the capacity to buy these dairy products. That is a far cry from a domestically orientated market industry that concentrated purely on the high profit fresh milk market of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, and Adelaide to a lesser degree. It now has an export industry based in the electorates of Wannon, Corangamite, Gippsland and in the seat of Murray. Of course the other states provide, broadly speaking, milk product for the domestic population with some export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the dairy industry is a great example of an industry that has made some fundamental changes, reinvested in the processing facilities, utilised the grain feeding and supplementary 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3637"> feeding of their animals, improved production through increased genetics, been prepared to make changes and been prepared to meet export market requirements in terms of quality and price. From a situation in the early 1980s where the arguments and the orientation were for maintaining a domestic market focus, they have now moved to be a very profitable export industry providing export earnings on the world market for Australian farmers and Australian consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bill especially in terms of its general philosophic thrust to maintain the quality of health, the quality of hygiene and the quality of research that needs to be maintained in animal industries across the board and in particular, in the dairy industry.</PARA></SPEECH>

This bill before the House is a clear indication again of the progressive attitude that is prevalent right throughout the dairy industry today. That attitude has certainly been a key factor over recent years in developing the dairy industry into what it is today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just before I touch on a few elements of the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Amendment Bill, I want to make some comments about the contribution from the last opposition speaker, the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). He made reference to the fact that, whenever legislation about the dairy industry is being debated in this place, members of the coalition, particularly members of the National Party, are always in here crowing about what a great industry it is. Of course, we are in here crowing about what a great industry it is. The former member for Murray and shadow minister for primary industry, Bruce Lloyd, represented an area in Victoria that has probably more dairy farmers in it than what there are in New South Wales. It is a very important industry to our constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also made reference to the fact that it was originally the Kerin plan that started the metamorphosis, I suppose, in developing the dairy industry into the successful industry it is today. He is correct again. We have never argued that or disputed that. We have supported it. At the end of the first I think it was seven years of the Kerin plan, when it was being renegotiated&mdash;I think the then minister for primary industries may have been the member for Hotham (Mr Crean)&mdash;it was supported&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did not understand the industry but, again, the coalition supported it. It is one of those things that we see from time to time and we are desperately trying to get other industries to get their focus in the same direction. The dairy industry, pre the Kerin plan era, was inward looking. They produced milk for the city markets, the market milk, as it is called. If there was a bit left over, they did a bit of processing and tried to export where there was a bit of an export market. They have now changed the focus to target those export markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was not involved in this place in those days but I was working in an industry in my local area where we have a large and vibrant healthy dairy industry. Notwithstanding the fact that the Victorians have stolen one of our processing plants&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="McARTHUR" NAMEID="VH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VH4">Mr McArthur</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is efficiency.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SU5">Mr VAILE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it has nothing to do with efficiency. That in itself is an indication of the future for this industry. I do not know how much help there has been from the Premier of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3638"> Victoria but that plant is being replaced with a brand new plant on a greenfield site in Victoria. The point I want to make is that the industry is continually looking forward. It is looking to improve itself, and looking to better production techniques to improve efficiency and gain better access into those export markets, without the assistance or protection of some of the more corrupt initiatives of some of our competitors. I instance the US here and the dairy export incentive program that it had from time to time. There are also the current arrangements under the CAP in the European Union. The member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) highlighted the fact that for half the year or more the dairy herds in those European countries are housed indoors and are grain fed. Without the subsidies that they receive, they would not have a hope of competing against our products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is just another part of the artillery that the dairy industry is putting together. They are prepared to contribute more, as a result of this bill, to research and development through the AAHC. They recognise that it is incredibly important that we maintain a healthy herd in Australia. We have to be continually on the lookout for the new diseases that are developing. We have seen what happened with world beef consumption as a result of mad cow disease in Britain. It was not anywhere near Australia but it had a detrimental effect on the consumption, world wide, of beef. That is just part of the problem that our beef industry faces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the dairy industry continues to improve. In those early days there was a great rationalisation in the numbers of dairy farms. Those farms have got bigger and more efficient. We are going to go in 1996 from producing 9.055 million litres to 9.411 million litres. The value of exports is going to go from $1.905 billion to $2.122 billion. A lot of people lose sight of the fact that Australia is a major exporter of primary products and, of course, the dairy industry is very important at the centre of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a comment on the importance of undertaking initiatives as the industry and the government are with the introduction of this bill where that levy is going to be increased. I think the member for Corangamite alluded to the amount of money that producers would be paying in this levy. But the more important point is the principle of having the levy paid directly from the producer into that fund, which all goes to research and development, so that it is completely transparent. It is not going through their industry organisations. As is pointed out in the explanatory memorandum and in the Bills Digest, this has been supported by industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> states that the doubling of the levy rate has the support of the Australian Dairy Industry Council, so they understand that they have to continually protect the product that we have and the reputation that we have. Australia has a fantastic reputation as far as primary products are concerned. We have to continue to protect that. The government recognises that. We recognise that we have to protect that reputation through the funding that we provide to AQIS and in continually improving the processes that AQIS undertakes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested in some comments in a publication called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Commodities</EMPHASIS>, which listed the figures I quoted earlier in relation to the capacity of milk production in Australia and the value of those exports to our economy. But the article also had some comments about world price forecasts. World prices for manufactured dairy products are forecast to rise. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">World cheese prices are forecast to increase by around five per cent to average $US2,390 a tonne in 1997&hyphen;98. The expected stronger growth in prices for cheese products compared with other dairy products reflects continuing strong demand growth and reduced volumes of subsidised European Union cheese exports as part of WTO commitments. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3639">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The European Union is expected to be able to meet WTO commitments because strong internal demand for cheese, particularly in Germany, and a slower growth in EU cheese production is likely to reduce internal pressures for increasing export subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Something that I continually raise in this place is my concern and my healthy scepticism about trade liberalisation. Australia has gone well down that path by comparison to other nations around the world, particularly in the dairy industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a very successful structure established within the dairy industry. It was not being subsidised by taxpayers; it was within the industry, supporting the development of export markets. I am referring to what originally started as the Kerin plan. Everybody in the industry contributed to that because everybody benefited; whether they were providing manufacturing milk or market milk, everybody benefited. That has been acceptable. But with the finalisation of the Uruguay Round and the establishment of the WTO, somebody, somewhere&mdash;whether it was in one of the European cities where these things are based, or in the WTO&mdash;decided that the mechanisms that had been established in the dairy industry were GATT illegal. So they had to be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry, being as dynamic as it is, was able to deal with that quite expeditiously. They developed a mechanism whereby they could replace that original all&hyphen;milk levy with a contribution to develop export markets that was acceptable as far as the World Trade Organisation was concerned. We have done that and the industry has responded quite expeditiously, so they can continue in the positive manner that they have over many years. But we do not see that from the nations that we compete with for world export market share in this industry. Anybody who has travelled to Europe and raised the issue of the common agricultural policy with any of those European countries knows that you get met with a stony look and a blank wall with regard to any moves to address the inequities that that policy creates. Those are the sorts of mechanisms that we have to compete against.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I still question the pace of change. We are being asked in Australia, in my view, to lead the way with regard to trade liberalisation, tariff reductions, getting rid of subsidies and the impediments to the clear transparent forms of trade. But my view is that we are not following the rest of the world; we are leading the rest of the world. We are trying to lead by example in Australia. And let us not be deceived in this, that Australia has a small population, a small economy by world standards and we are not leading anybody. We have not got the muscle to push other nations around, and I believe that we should be a little more diligent with regard to our industries in Australia, monitor how it is travelling overseas and do what we have got to do to keep pace. We all support trade liberalisation, but not at the expense of Australian industry and certainly not at the expense of the Australian dairy industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an expected continuing growth in Australian milk production, and the expansion in Australian milk supply is expected to continue in 1997&hyphen;98 with production forecast to increase by 3.9 per cent. This growth is based on a forecast increase in cow numbers and on milk yields returning to their longer&hyphen;term trend following the dry conditions in 1995&hyphen;96&mdash;that came out of that journal again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the member for Corio&mdash;and I did not hear the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) before him&mdash;was criticising again government members' contributions to debate on legislation that is relative to the dairy industry on the basis that we are continually crowing about what a good industry it is and how well it is going. It is going well. Those figures substantiate it. We understand that there are very dry conditions in Victoria, but in times past there have been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3640"> very dry conditions in New South Wales and in other dairy production areas. That is not the fault of the industry. The industry as a whole is progressing well and is performing extremely well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> And as an individual that represents an electorate that has a predominant primary industry, the dairy industry, I will continue to get up in this place and represent the views of the dairy farmers in my electorate. They have progressed and gone with the times and, in my view, the dairy industry leads our other agricultural production industries in Australia, in terms of what its farmers have done in developing their industries through self&hyphen;help. They do not come around with their hands out to government and say, `You prop us up. You do this. You do that.' They are proactive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure that we are debating today in this dairy produce levy bill is a proactive move, supported by the industry. They are going to increase the levies payable so that they can ensure the protection of the health of the herd in Australia and they want to make those levies direct so that they are quite transparent. They do not want any organisations like the World Trade Organisation criticising Australian producers for being corrupt, or saying that it is another hazy sort of subsidy. They want to make those levies direct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, it is important that we answer those criticisms that have been levelled at the government by the opposition members this morning in debating this bill. It is important that we recognise the job that has been done by the industry as a whole, and particularly the industry leaders over the last 10 or so years. We acknowledge that the initial development of the Kerin plan started this process, but it was not going to work without the absolute commitment of all the players in the industry: the producers, the processors and the exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against the odds and despite the corrupt practices of the European Union and, from time to time, the American dairy industry with their subsidies on milk powder into South&hyphen;East Asia, one of our major markets for milk powder, the industry has progressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And before I finish, I will make a comment on my views of how the dairy industry will deal with their situation as they face up to the reviews that are being implemented as a result of the implementation of the Hilmer national competition policy. As there is a requirement for a review of the activities of all the statutory marketing authorities across Australia, I believe that the dairy industry will come through that review process as having modernised itself, as being very competitive and as being able to maintain an argument that there is a provision of public benefit in the way the industry is structured now, without having to dismantle it for the sake of some ideological dogma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the member for Corangamite is still here. I point out that this industry is unlike other primary industries in that it is genuine about the way it performs in the modern world as far as a liberalised market is concerned. I do not support change for change's sake. I do not support change just to ensure that something fits into an ideological model. I acknowledge that there are areas of our economy that need change, but I do not believe this is one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This industry has made the hard yards over the years. It really is an example to other primary industries in this nation. They should get off their backsides and do something about their product, and not just produce a bit of excess and say, `We can't sell that in the cities so 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3641"> we will export it.' They should target their export markets and earn export dollars for the Australian economy. This industry is a perfect example of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the industry, I support what is proposed in this bill. I believe it will further encourage the development of an industry that is really going to be important to the Australian economy as we move towards the year 2000. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak today in support of these important amendments contained in the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill 1997. The dairy industry is one of Australia's key export industries. Most of the Victorian part of that export industry is in the electorate of Murray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before the House today does a number of things. It imposes a levy on milk producers to fund the contribution of the dairy industry to the Australian Animal Health Council. It also doubles the maximum research levy rate which may be prescribed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Animal Health Council is Australia's peak animal health body. Its main function is to ensure that our animal health standards are world best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the previous speaker&mdash;the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile)&mdash;said, there is no room today in our highly competitive markets for food and fibre for any industry that is less than world best. All industry has to be competitive in terms of its costs. Those costs include the amount of dollars that have to be spent on animal medication, in making sure that animal health is always at a peak. Our reputation in Australia for the export of animals and dairy product is beyond reproach in terms of its safety for human consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Animal Health Council is funded by Commonwealth, state, territory and industry contributions. Until now, the dairy industry has contributed to this organisation through the surplus moneys paid to the Dairy Research and Development Corporation&mdash;these were left over when the exotic animal diseases program ended&mdash;and also through grants from the Australian Dairy Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other industries like beef, wool, sheep production and so on agreed last year to a package which introduced a similar system to the one that is now before the House. That package received bipartisan support in both chambers, and the support of the minor parties and independents in the Senate. These amendments have wholehearted support throughout Australia, given that they seek to give an industry more self&hyphen;sufficiency and more dollars to make sure that we have disease free status for our dairy production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The activities of the Australian Animal Health Council are crucial to Australia as we seek not only to reach world best&mdash;I suggest we are just about there at the moment with our dairy production&mdash;but to maintain that footing in our highly competitive markets. Therefore, the importance of world&hyphen;best research and development in the areas of animal health cannot be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Animal Health Council, when it was established in 1995, was in many respects ahead of its time. It recognised the significance of partnerships for growth between industry and government. It was a model advocated by the Nairn report for adoption in relation to plants. This council recognises that there are important animal health issues which cross industry boundaries. They must be responded to nationally in a coordinated manner. All of the Australian industry needs to be involved.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3642">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our continued growth in export development across all of our agricultural industries is dependent on our being able to demonstrate the highest possible standards of animal health and quarantine services in Australia, particularly in relation to border checks and risk analysis assessment. Our budget, just announced last night, adds substantially to this country's ability to put in place world best quarantine services. More than $70 million are now going to be dedicated to ensuring&mdash;as we have ever more visitors to Australia&mdash;that we can stand up and do the best possible to stop diseased animals or plants from coming into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the good news that the Olympic Games will be here shortly. Of course, that exposes us to many more pressures at the borders. We expect a great number of visitors. We will have to make sure that our quarantine services are up to speed and that the people coming to our Olympic Games are not hampered or held up at our airports but, at the same time, are exposed to the most rigorous testing of any product that they might bring in inadvertently&mdash;or perhaps deliberately&mdash;that could put our animal or plant industries at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very important initiative in our budget last night, and it shows that our government understands the significance of agribusiness in Australia. It not only gives lip&hyphen;service to the importance of the agribusiness industries but it also puts the dollars there to make sure that we can sustain our world best practices. Where we are still a little short and need more research&mdash;perhaps in introducing more feedlot technology for some of our animals, for example, our poultry or our piggery industries; or introducing new forms of agriculture&mdash;we will take on board world best practice. We will test that world best practice in Australia and make sure that none of our changes in animal husbandry are ever compromised in terms of the disease factors that could be introduced with new systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advantage of this amendment is that the levy allows the Australian Animal Health Council to plan, coordinate and have total industry involvement and cooperation across the nation. It is exactly what we need and it is what this bill promises to deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hardly need to say that the dairy industry is one of our most successful agribusiness stories in Australia, and the previous speaker acknowledged that. The dairy industry in Australia has a long history. It began as the milk cow of the early settlers; a few more cows were milked; the billy was taken around; and the milk was sold in an unpasteurised form. We used our dairy industry as a means of settling a lot of our returned servicemen after World War I and World War II. The industry has played a great role in our social engineering in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, the management of our dairy industry has nothing to do with social engineering. It is businesslike in every way and shape. In fact, in the electorate of Murray, it is world best in terms of its current technology. Its cost competitiveness has been recognised by joint ventures with Snow Brand, one of Japan's leading dairy manufacturers, which has come and joined forces with our Tatura Milk Products factory in Tatura. Together, they manufacture infant formula to the highest standards of hygiene. That infant formula is re&hyphen;exported throughout South&hyphen;East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very recently, we had another greenfield development when Mitsubishi and Meiji joined Murray Goulburn at Cobram. In recognition of the long&hyphen;term sustainability of our dairy industry, they entered into an agreement. They now manufacture infant formula in conjunction with one of our dairy icons, Murray Goulburn, and they, too, export that infant formula into South&hyphen;East Asia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3643">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, if there was ever a major disease threat in Australia, those exports would be compromised&mdash;infant formula or any form of food&mdash;as they are highly susceptible to consumer lack of confidence. In Australia, we are preparing our industry with this funding levy to ensure that we are always on the front foot when it comes to doing the research and development, to ensure that we have the best information, the best advice and the best management practices on our dairy farms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electorate of Murray is one of Australia's largest producers of dairy product, in our Goulburn, Loddon and Murray valleys and it is the home of Australia's dairy export industry. In particular, besides the infant formula that goes straight out into South&hyphen;East Asia, we are also targeting the high value added ends of the markets in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. We are already experiencing some of the biggest market growth in Japan, where we are neck and neck with New Zealand in claiming about one&hyphen;third of that export market for our dairy product. As well, within our own domestic market for dairy products, we have some of the highest dairy product consumption in the world, and so it is equally important to make sure that our domestic consumers are protected from any disease that could enter the food chain and jeopardise both the consumption of products and human health in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already, in the dairy industry, a number of support programs. They have, over the years, helped our industry to grow from its infancy and to establish a form of dairy production which does not depend on artificial feeding of animals all through winter. We still have range reared animals to a very large extent in Australia, and many would argue that this is the healthiest way to produce dairy product: beta carotene from the sun is still to be found in our dairy products. The previous government support programs have been always of enormous support to the Australian industry. Now, of course, that dairy industry has come of age. It does not need, and has not asked, in recent times, for handouts. The levy system, which involves our dairy producers contributing towards their R&amp;D costs, is the sign of a mature industry with mature members who understand that the industry needs to stand on its own feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry does look to government to maintain a fair and equitable trading regime in our region and to make sure that our quarantine services are as good as they can possibly be. It looks to our government to insist that the tariff regimes that we face in other nations should be brought down, in line with WTO obligations and commitments. But, in this bill, we are certainly not asking for any form of subsidy, handout or support. As I say, this bill is evidence of a mature industry that can stand on its own two feet and that understands that it needs to make a contribution so that it can be in control of its future. The Australian Animal Health Council levy will ensure that we can be world's best, cost competitive, and that both Australia and overseas countries continue to benefit from some of the world's best and safest dairy product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to be able to support this amendment bill today. I believe, as I said before, that it is a mark of a mature industry, an industry that understands what it has to do to stay world's best.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Mr Deputy Speaker said, I am going to make some concluding remarks on the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill and cognate bill on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson).<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Before I do that, I want to make some comments in relation to some of the criticisms that have been made from the other side of the House, and I will conclude with an outline of what the bills seek to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, let me say that the shadow minister's performance here clearly underlines his position as remaining very much in the shadows for an awfully long time. He really was not quite across the issue at all. The comments made from the other side of the House were in relation to the government's support for, and commitment to, research and development. Let me make it quite clear that we do fund research and development on a dollar for dollar basis: a dollar from the government for every dollar contributed by the industry, up to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production. Last night, that commitment was locked up in the federal budget; so any suggestion coming from the other side of the House that we are not committed to delivering on research and development is a fallacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another benefit of the coalition in government has been our responsible approach to the management of the economy of our nation. This has had a dramatic effect on the small businesses of Australia, the primary producers of Australia and, in reference to this bill, the dairy industry in this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since coming to government 14 months ago, official interest rates have fallen by 1.5 per cent. Every 0.5 per cent reduction in official interest rates delivers a saving of $90 million to the farm sector alone. It benefits all farmers, because everyone can participate in those lower interest rates. It also helps the processing and manufacturing sector of the dairy industry, to which this bill refers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our financial management has seen official interest rates at their lowest point for 30 years&mdash;unlike Labor's disaster, where they took interest rates to the highest we have ever seen in this nation. So Labor members should not come into the Main Committee and lecture us about the budget last night. They should get their facts straight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is acknowledged that drought is starting to return to some parts of Australia, and we acknowledge that there are some dairy farmers in those areas who will have their capacity to maintain production affected. We are concerned that drought is once again creeping into many parts of Australia, but let me remind the other side of the House that it was this government that extended by six months the exceptional circumstance provision for that recovery phase for those producers who had come out of drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might remind the other side of the House that they had a recovery phase of six months post the revocation of drought status from an individual or a region. We extended that at the end of last year by a further six months, effectively doubling the recovery phase. The shadow minister is not in the House, and he is obviously going to remain very much in the shadows whilst ever he comes in peddling this misinformation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do understand the plight of rural Australia. We understand also the importance of the dairy industry to regional Australia. Many members on our side of parliament have indicated 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3645"> the importance of the dairy industry and the importance of this bill to the dairy industry, because the dairy industry is one of our great success stories in agriculture in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only have we seen the dairy industry modernise itself, we have also seen it become more and more world competitive. It is important we continue to support them in their efforts to make sure they remain cost competitive. The latest commodity bulletin, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Commodities, Vol. 4, No. 1, March 1997</EMPHASIS>, shows that the prices received from processed commodities and dairy products will increase over 1997&hyphen;98 from an average of $US1,530 a tonne to $US1,970. That is an increase in world prices for butter and skim milk powder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are to make the most of those forecast price increases and let the dairy farmers capture their share of that market, we have got to make sure we provide them with the best possible economic climate in this country, we support them with research and development and we make sure the changes to the industrial relations legislation allow for the processing plants and the farm labour side of things to be world competitive. Otherwise, they will not make the most of this opportunity and avail themselves of the increased prices and demand that are forecast to flow into the world dairy market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments contained in these bills will assist the industry enhance its capacity to undertake animal health and research and development activities in the future. This will safeguard the industry and lead to further improvements in our competitiveness in both domestic and international markets and increased profitability for all sectors of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important point is that the Australian dairy industry has given its full support to these legislative amendments contained in these bills. So we not only have the support of the dairy industry, but the government understands the need for these bills. We have supported it and we are not doing anything that is in conflict with the dairy industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I want to say that we will deliver on R&amp;D. It is the base for building a more productive agricultural sector in Australia. We will deliver in terms of our Natural Heritage Trust Fund which will flow into many regional areas of Australia and benefit the agricultural sector and, at the same time, create jobs in regional Australia. We are also committed, as per the budget last night, to making sure that our quarantine service is not underfunded, that it has the funds it requires to make sure that we remain free of diseases which could accidentally arrive on our shores. I thank all those members from both sides who have made a contribution and I commend the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) 1996 Budget changes to English language programs did impact upon Program 4 but did not impact upon Program 3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government identified significant savings in the 1996 Budget through simplifying labour market programs and cutting back on ineffective programs. Consequently, the Government reduced funding for training programs by one third overall in the current financial year. Savings were achieved in programs such as the Special Intervention Program, now part of the Job Seeker Preparation and Support Program, which was a major labour market program providing English as a second language training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Department is unable to provide information on a State by State basis of savings in funds. The Department's programs are administered on an Area basis and Area boundaries are not congruent with State boundaries. In addition, it is not possible to quantify the impact of the savings because the use of labour market program funds in Areas is determined by labour market circumstances which change from year to year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) It is anticipated that there will be some reductions in the number of English courses funded, however, the Department is unable to provide an estimate of numbers of teachers or job seekers likely to be affected. The Department contracts courses from a range of providers who determine their own teacher numbers.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3648"> Airservices Australia have provided the following advice:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The figures quoted are indicative of the fuel capacities of these aircraft types. Precise figures may vary, depending on the configuration and operator's specifications for individual aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the quantity of fuel loaded may vary in accordance with the individual operator's requirements and the type of flight involved, e.g. less fuel is normally carried on short haul flights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) During the period 1 January 1970 to 18 December 1996 a total of fourteen occurrences were reported to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) involving pilots misidentifying Essendon Airport for Melbourne (Tullamarine) Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In each case the error was detected at an early stage by Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) and the aircraft redirected to Melbourne Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of these fourteen occurrences, nine involved high capacity aircraft engaged in fare paying passenger operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) 747 passenger aircraft on a southerly approach to Melbourne Airport overfly Essendon Airport, using its instrument landing system, before making a right hand turn to align themselves with Melbourne's runway 34.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All aircraft approaching Melbourne (or Essendon Airport) Airport are under positive ATC control and are immediately redirected if misaligned at any stage. As an additional navigational aid, strobe lights have been in place for a number of years on the approach to Melbourne's runway 34.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has advised that there has not been an incident of a 747 aircraft mistakenly landing at Essendon in the 26 years that Melbourne Airport has operated. Accordingly, the FAC considers that it is not necessary to have safety and disaster precautions in place in anticipation of such an event. In any case, Essendon Airport, as with all other FAC airports, has an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Aerodrome Emergency Procedure that draws on the resources of both State and Federal Governments as the level of demand or incident requires. The FAC also notes that according to BASI investigations if, for whatever reason, a 747 was to land at Essendon Airport it could do so safely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The FAC has advised that Essendon Airport's management has before it a number of "in&hyphen;confidence" proposals. These are in various stages. Some are advanced to a level where lease documentation is ready for execution, some are in a conceptual design stage, while others are still in early negotiation phase. They include both aviation and non aviation development. It is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the aggregate value of these proposed investments given their different stages of development. Some may not proceed for commercial reasons, and the future of a number of these proposals is dependent on the Government's decision&hyphen;making on the future of Essendon Airport.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1 (a) The net public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) is a measure of the public sector's direct call on financing which is met by non&hyphen;government sources. At the broad public sector level, it is determined by the cash deficits of all levels of government (including both general government and public trading enterprise sectors) after adjusting for the effect of inter&hyphen;government loans, and payments by the Commonwealth of superannuation and compensation provisions of the public trading enterprise sector. The PSBR may also be disaggregated into net financing requirements (NFRs) for each level of government and/or institutional sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Historical data on the movement of the net PSBR are contained in ABS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Government Finance Statistics, Australia</EMPHASIS>  publications and the annual Budget Papers.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The broad goal of the Treasury portfolio is to advise and assist the Government in the management of the Australian economy.

One of the Treasury's policy objectives outlined in the plan is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3650"> the "maintenance of a stable macroeconomic environment with low inflation and a sustainable external position, which is conducive to promoting enduring growth in economic activity and hence employment".

Net worth is determined by a range of factors including receipts and expenditures and changes in the value of assets (ie appreciation/depreciation). Whether a secular decline in revenue would contribute to lower public sector net worth would depend on other factors affecting public sector net worth. Important elements would be movements in outlays and changes in the value of assets and liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The data indicate that, as a share of GDP, the fall in national saving since the mid&hyphen;1970s has largely been due to the weakness in public saving since that time. In turn, the weakness in public saving reflects the large underlying Commonwealth budget deficits from the mid&hyphen;1970s to the mid&hyphen;1990s, with only occasional surpluses achieved. The Government therefore gives priority to improving public sector saving by addressing its own saving performance at the Commonwealth level.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Lump sum compensation payments for personal injury are awarded in compensation for loss or injury sustained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The compensation provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 apply to lump sum compensation payments made wholly or partly in respect of loss of earnings or loss of earning capacity to a person who has received or claimed a social security income support payment for the period in respect of which the compensation is paid. In these situations, 50 per cent of the lump sum is usually taken into account. Lump sum compensation payments in respect of non&hyphen;economic loss only are not subject to the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) From 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1996, the average period recipients of lump sum compensation payments made wholly or partly in respect of loss of earnings or loss of earning capacity were precluded from receiving a social security income support payment was 100 weeks</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) From 20 March 1997 the divisor used to calculate preclusion periods will change from the all person average weekly earnings amount (currently $572.10) to the amount above which no pension is payable to a single person under the income test (currently $400.80 a week).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time the divisor is changed, partners of lump sum compensation recipients will be removed from the preclusion provisions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) On 26 February, Mr Lindsay Fox telephoned me as a courtesy to inform me his Foxerco consortium had successfully bid for the lease on Avalon Airport. I am advised that there have been no discussions between my Department and Foxerco in relation to the establishment of an airfreight facility at Avalon Airport. The Departments of Finance and Defence have been primarily responsible for the leasing of Avalon Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) and (3) In relation to the article in the Australian of 17 January 1997, even with some changes in available freight space on passenger operations, it is still the case that at present around 90% of air freight transported to and from Australia on scheduled services is carried in the belly hold of passenger services. This position has been reinforced by the major expansion in passenger services with currently 54 international and Australian carriers operating some 700 services per week to and from Australia. Freight carried on these passenger services is supplemented by 28 weekly dedicated freighter services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current level of belly hold capacity on scheduled passenger services per week means that there is a well developed and sophisticated transport system which provides freight capacity to a wide range of gateways and destinations. Importantly, the level of scheduled passenger services means that freight space is often available at much lower rates than would otherwise be available if freight capacity was only provided on dedicated freight services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department has advised that there is a large amount of unutilised capacity overall on international routes to and from Australia. While the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> current level of freight capacity operated by dedicated freighters and belly holds of passenger aircraft flying to and from Australia is generally sufficient to meet the current demand for air freight exports, constraints do exist on certain routes during peak export seasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To overcome these constraints Australia is adopting a liberal approach to negotiating dedicated freight capacity and approving supplementary and charter services to meet market demand during these peak periods.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Some limited data on aircraft movements is available in graphical form. More comprehensive data covering both passenger and aircraft movements has been requested from the Atlanta authorities but is yet to be received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. The main conclusion of the review is that the runway and terminal facilities at Sydney Airport will have sufficient capacity to cope effectively with the traffic demands associated with the Games even with the current curfew arrangements and an 80 movements/hour cap on aircraft movements. This conclusion will be kept under review to take account of additional data which will become available in the lead up to the Games.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has endorsed the use of Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) for all infants. However, HBV has not yet been included in the standard infant schedule because it is only available as an additional injection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NHMRC has advised that parents who do express an interest in infant HBV should be encouraged to have their children vaccinated, as long as compliance with other schedule vaccines is not compromised.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NHMRC has also emphasised that the progressive introduction of universal infant and pre&hyphen;adolescent vaccination should be in addition to continued and vigorous implementation of the previous recommendations for selective hepatitis B vaccination for those at risk, i.e. all infants born to HBsAg+ mothers and to all infants from communities with a hepatitis B carrier rate over two per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The NHMRC reviewed recommendations for Hepatitis A during 1996. Hepatitis A is not recommended for universal vaccination.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Genetically modified soya beans have been granted approval in the USA that allows them to enter commerce in that country without differentiation from conventional soya beans.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Australian Defence Force was involved in the Formula One Grand Prix which was staged in Melbourne over the period 6&hyphen;9 March 1997, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A 10 minute display by the RAAF's Roulettes aerobatic display team on 7, 8 and 9 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A flypast by a single F/A&hyphen;18 aircraft on the race day. An F&hyphen;111 aircraft was also scheduled to make a flypast, however, an unserviceability which developed enroute to the Grand Prix required the aircraft to return to base.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Use of an area in Albert Park Barracks by the organisers and a catering organisation for the duration of the event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total additional cost of supporting this event was calculated at $108,000; however, because the operational aircraft involved undertook meaningful training enroute to and from the venue, the majority of this cost can be assigned to training. The additional cost of involvement was therefore reduced to approximately $28,000. This figure does not include the short duration participation by three local military bands on 9 March 1997. The organisers were not charged for the use of the area in Albert Park Barracks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Grand Prix organisers had legal responsibility for, and Defence has been advised that they took out insurance to cover, any injury or damage to third parties in the vicinity of Albert Park resulting from event activities on the ground. Defence took responsibility for any injury or damage that might have been caused by the activities of Defence aircraft or the Army parachute display team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Grand Prix organisers were responsible for the environmental impact of the event. However, the ADF also monitors the environmental impact of its activities. No adverse environmental impact resulting from ADF participation has been identified.

The opportunity to redeem points, however, is restricted by the airlines' conditions, eg. not all flights have seats available for frequent flyer use, not all destinations can be reached using a specific carrier and their partner airlines, and there are "block out" periods by the airlines (peak times) when no seats are available.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No. Frequent flyer points were to have been used for a Sydney to Darwin trip on 19 September 1996. However this trip was cancelled and has been rescheduled for later in 1997 using frequent flyer points. On each internal flight booked for me a request is made for a frequent flyer fare. The restrictions the airlines maintain in allocating a limited number of frequent flyer seats per flight, the requirement by the airlines to book these fares in advance, as well as the frequency of changing flight details at the last moment before leaving, make it difficult to utilise the frequent flyer program effectively. Every effort is made within my office to comply with the Government's current policy of using frequent flyer points for Ministerial travel wherever possible.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="3687" SPEAKER="Smith, Warwick, MP" NAMEID="GJ4" ELECTORATE="Bass" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Sport, Territories and Local Government; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr Warwick Smith</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra has advised that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) Telstra has entered into a multi&hyphen;year sponsorship agreement with Super League.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Telstra is managing its overall employment levels within the context and veracity of Telstra's current business plan. On this basis, Telstra is planning staff reductions of some 22,000 staff from 1996/1997 to 1998/1999. Staff whose positions are made redundant will be offered redeployment where available or voluntary redundancy. Those staff choosing voluntary redundancy will also be eligible for Telstra's new Career Transition Service. This service has been developed to assist employees in finding a new job as soon as possible. Whilst Telstra is committed to the principles of fairness and equity in the redeployment of staff, involuntary redundancy does remain an option where no redeployment or relocation opportunities can be identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Due to the presence of unsafe levels of airborne asbestos fibres in Wittenoom and its immediate surrounds, Telstra has taken the position that it will no longer install or maintain services in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra advises it has an obligation under the law to provide a safe work environment for its employees. Based on medical and scientific evidence, Telstra has concluded that it can neither reasonably nor adequately protect its employees against the risks associated with exposure to asbestos. Telstra's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3688"> position relies heavily on the extensive medical and scientific evidence contained in the 1994 Western Australia Legislative Assembly Select Committee Report on Wittenoom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra has held discussions with AUSTEL and with Wittenoom residents about a number of alternatives for serving the town. During February, the repeater site at Wittenoom failed. In accordance with Telstra's policy of not unnecessarily endangering the health and safety of its employees, Telstra installed two payphones 1.2 kilometres outside the town on 14 February. Telstra has also agreed to provide to St John's Ambulance Service in Wittenoom, at no charge, hardware for effective radio service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) Telstra is constructing a broadband cable network as a platform for a range of communication and information services, including Pay TV. Telstra and News Corporation have entered into a joint venture to provide Foxtel Cable Television using Telstra's broadband service. During 1995/96 Telstra invested some $113 million as its share of the joint venture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Whilst specific projections on profit are regarded as commercial in</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&amp;(c) confidence, Telstra considers that results to date, combined with future projections, are in line with Telstra's expectations and demonstrate the value and the future potential of the investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)As the Chief Executive Officer of a major Australian company with international business operations and alliances, Mr Blount is required to undertake extensive and frequent overseas travel. Mr Blount's overseas travel commitments include an average of some 5 Telstra related business trips per annum to the USA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No. It is inappropriate to provide details about an individual's taxation affairs which remain a matter between the taxpayer and the Australian Taxation Office. This approach is consistent with the requirements of the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</EMPHASIS>  which includes specific secrecy provisions to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) No. Telstra's partnership is a separate commercial agreement with Super League&mdash;not Rupert Murdoch or News Limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Telstra as a national and international enterprise must make sponsorship decisions on the basis of its expanding business, and not on any one geographic location. In Telstra's view, Super League offers the advantage of both a national and international competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra has no intention that any of its sponsorship decisions be contentious. Telstra has chosen to sponsor a new venture with international ambitions. In addition, Super League has an extensive junior 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> development program which Telstra also sponsors, and which was a critical part of the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rugby League is the biggest spectator sport in Sydney, Australia's largest market, and in Brisbane. It has a rapidly growing presence in Adelaide, Perth, Townsville and Newcastle, and will soon expand into Melbourne. It is the only winter sport that can offer the exposure an organisation like Telstra requires. Super League's presence in Auckland is also important, as Telstra consolidates its position in the New Zealand market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Super League has strong financial backing and enables Telstra to reach a mass market. The association with Super League, and particularly the Junior Development components including sponsorship of the Under 19 and Under 17 competitions, will enhance Telstra's brand by reaching a family and youth market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package of benefits attached to the Super League sponsorship are substantial. The package gives Telstra the equivalent of naming rights sponsorship of the ten clubs currently in the competition, plus others as they come on board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ten clubs are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Townsville&mdash;Brisbane&mdash;Canberra&mdash;Canterbury&mdash;Cronulla&mdash;Penrith&mdash;Adelaide&mdash;Hunter Valley&mdash;Perth&mdash;Auckland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra also gets Nationwide exposure via Super League broadcast on the ABC plus nationwide coverage on Foxtel and NSW/Queensland broadcasts on the Nine Network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The leveraging of the sponsorship will be provided by the Super League itself, rather than Telstra. Unlike usual sponsorships where Telstra invests heavily in "below the line" costs to make the sponsorship perform, the Super League sponsorship fee includes all such costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra is confident that this sponsorship will enhance its brand position in Australia and internationally, as well as giving opportunities to expand its business through such an association with Super League.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) A total of 2664 civilian positions have been abolished in Defence from 2 March 1996 to 28 February 1997. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the number of positions abolished in any given period is not a reliable indicator of staff reductions. For example, some positions abolished might be replaced by others in different parts of the Department and at different levels. Further, it is usual, for a variety of reasons, for any department's establishment to contain a certain number of positions that might not be able to be filled within available resources; a certain proportion of these positions will be abolished from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, in the period covered by this question, the number of civilian staff in the Department decreased by around 1650 with some 1500 staff accepting voluntary redundancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Australian Navy Torpedo Maintenance Establishment (RANTME) and the Army Malaria Institute (AMI) (both previously based in the Greater Sydney region) might both be considered to be Defence "offices" which have been closed since 2 March 1996. However, many of the functions and staff at RANTME have subsequently been relocated to other Defence locations in metropolitan Sydney, while the AMI has subsequently been relocated to Enoggera, QLD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The existing Defence civilian personnel information management system, CIVILPRISM, is not able to breakdown the abolished positions into localities.

Of the five submissions that did specifically address administrative test breach penalties (Australian Council of Trade Unions, Offenders Aid and Rehabilitation Services of South Australia Inc., The Brotherhood of St. Laurence, Australian Council of Social Service and National Welfare Rights Network), most advocated the introduction of a rate reduction period rather than a period of non&hyphen;payment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. $12 million over three years is included in the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget allocations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) A range of activities over three years is planned under this funding allocation, including activities administered under the Science and Technology Awareness and the Enterprise Education components of the Innovation Culture Program of the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, as well as support of enhanced youth&hyphen;focused activities by the TV and radio science units of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recent call for applications for grants from the Science and Technology Awareness Program has received a significant response and has identified projects such as school curriculum resource materials; innovative drama, games and competitions (including internet aspects); hands&hyphen;on and interactive science shows and exhibitions; residential summer schools; and visits to schools by gifted communicators. All of these are directed at promoting science to young persons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the auspices of the Science and Technology Awareness Program there is also support for teams in the Science Olympiads. At a broader level but equally relevant to young people will be the allocation of science awards for excellence, including the Australia Prize and the Daley Science, Technology and Engineering Journalism Awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a component to enhance the uptake of innovative activities, with specific activities aimed at improving school/industry links and development of small business career information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Publicly announced initiatives include: $1.83m to the ABC and support for teams' preparation and travel to the annual Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics Olympiads competitions to the value of $750,000 over 3 years, as well as enhancement of an Innovative Culture through enterprise education initiatives to the value of $2.45 million over three years. In the order of $4 million of funds over three years in the Science and Technology Awareness Program is also made available as grants to support specific awareness&hyphen;raising projects which are proposed by individuals and groups. This year's process for identifying successful recipients of the Science and Technology Grants is currently under way, with a public announcement expected in the near future identifying those who were successful in their application. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3707"> $1.88 million over three years has been allocated to the Australia Prize and the Daley Awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Raising awareness of the importance of science and technology for Australia's economic and social development requires attitudinal and cultural change, which is a long&hyphen;term proposition. Activities being conducted under the Science and Technology Awareness Program are part of a strategy which is designed to contribute to the objective. Individual elements and activities target specific groups in the community, and each project supported has specific milestones and outputs which are judged to contribute to the overall Program strategy. Research on Australians' attitudes to science and technology is commissioned to evaluate the Science and Technology Awareness Program.</PARA>
