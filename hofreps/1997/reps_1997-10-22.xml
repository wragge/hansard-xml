<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959, the Civil Aviation Act 1988, and other aviation&hyphen;related legislation. The amendments to the Carriers' Liability Act and the Civil Aviation Act mainly relate to the Commonwealth's initiative in introducing a national scheme requiring air carriers to carry mandatory non&hyphen;voidable passenger liability insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This requirement means that, in the event of an air accident, passengers, or their relatives, are assured as far as possible of receiving compensation to the amount of $500,000 per passenger for their death or injury. The Commonwealth requirements are reflected in complementary state legislation, so that a mandatory passenger liability insurance scheme will operate nationally to cover all commercial flights in Australia. Uniform application of state legislation will not come into effect until these Commonwealth amendments are enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal amendments proposed to the two acts are of a minor nature and are intended to make the administration of the national scheme simpler, and thereby ensure the full and effective implementation of the Commonwealth's initiative. The amendments to the Carriers' Liability Act will authorise the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA, to directly administer both the Commonwealth Carriers' Liability Act and the complementary 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> state legislation, rather than under delegation from the Commonwealth and state ministers responsible for transport. This will clarify the position on State&hyphen;Commonwealth delegation of powers, and powers of enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, to assist the Civil Aviation Safety Authority further with the enforcement of the national requirements, offences under the state acts must be regarded as Commonwealth offences. To this end, the Carriers' Liability Act will also be amended to enable Commonwealth authorities to investigate and prosecute offences under the state acts as if they were Commonwealth offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further minor amendment to the Carriers' Liability Act will allow Australian governments to self&hyphen;insure their risks under the act, instead of requiring them to take out commercial insurance. At this stage, Commonwealth and state government agencies are required to insure any passengers that they occasionally carry for reward, in accordance with the Carriers' Liability Act requirements. However, it is not the practice of Australian governments to carry commercial insurance. The bill therefore provides that, where both carrier and insurer are the Crown, the carrier need not have a stipulated contract of insurance to satisfy the technical requirements of the act, but must still satisfy CASA that the arrangements it puts in place for coverage of passengers satisfies those requirements of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the Carriers' Liability Act and the Civil Aviation Act will also impose conditions upon air operators' certificates, AOCs, which will require that operators continuously hold the mandatory passenger liability insurance required by the Carriers' Liability Act. Therefore, these amendments will give CASA the authority under legislation to more effectively prevent an operator carrying passengers without the mandatory insurance. CASA will be empowered to cancel, suspend or vary an AOC where an operator allows that insurance to lapse, but continues to carry passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes a number of minor corrections to other aviation related legislation. The corrections, of a formal or typographical nature, in the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Act 1995 have retrospec 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9442"> tive effect, in order to ensure that they have effect from the original date of commencement of the provisions being corrected. The retrospective repeal of certain amendments in the Civil Aviation Act 1988 is purely to remove them, as they are no longer necessary. The corrections and the repeal have no effect on the rights, duties and obligations of any person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal amendments in this bill will ensure effective protection of an aviation consumer's entitlement to adequate compensation in the event of an air accident, anywhere in Australia. This will fully implement the original intention of the Commonwealth's initiative, in reforming this aspect of consumer protection in the aviation sector. I present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, Australia owes a significant debt to the men and women who have served in defence of Australia. The purpose of this bill is to protect and preserve one of their long-standing compensatory benefits, a subsidised housing loan under the Defence Service Homes Act 1918.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has been very pleased with the reduction in interest rates. This is continuing good news for the economy in general. However, the reduction in the market rates for housing loans has significantly reduced the value of the beneficial interest rates that have traditionally been available to borrowers under the defence service home loan scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill introduces a guaranteed minimum subsidy that will ensure defence service home borrowers retain an interest rate advantage of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at least 1.5 per cent lower than the benchmark rate, regardless of future changes in the market interest rates. These changes will take effect from 5 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benchmark rate is the average unregulated standard annual rate of interest applied to the largest number of owner occupied housing loans provided by the five largest banking group providers of housing finance in Australia. This guaranteed minimum subsidy provides a simple means for responding to and accommodating future fluctuations in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also introduces a single rate of interest for those many borrowers whose loans may comprise two or even three different rates linked to different levels of borrowings. Each of these multi-tiered loan rates will be collapsed into a single interest rate. The effective new interest rate will depend on the current mix of interest rates on a particular loan. This arrangement will benefit many borrowers and means the abolition of the 10 per cent interest rate which has been an issue of some concern to the veteran community. Until now they have been prevented from repaying their 10 per cent tier faster than the lower tiers. Its introduction is part of this government's continuing commitment to providing and improving justly deserved compensation measures to the veterans and war widows of our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Continuing this rationalisation of the defence service home interest rates, this bill will reduce the interest rate on additional advances and on advances made for essential repairs. In reducing the interest rate on these advances, the government completes its reform of these rates which it began during the 1996-97 budget when a lower interest rate was introduced for certain new additional advances. All advances will now have an interest rate of 6.85 per cent or less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defence service home scheme is administered jointly by the Commonwealth and the Westpac Banking Corporation. The administrative arrangements are set by agreement between the Commonwealth and Westpac. Following any legislative change some consequent amendments need to be made to the agreement. In addition to those implementing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9443"> lower interest rates, these amendments will reflect changes in business and banking practice since the original agreement in 1988 and the need to simplify administrative procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this bill once again demonstrates the determination of this government to preserve and protect the benefits of veterans and their families. The bill not only benefits many people by direct interest reductions, but the guaranteed minimum subsidy provides an important, continuing protection of the benefits under the defence service home scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

This means there will be a two&hyphen;year effective period for staff to transfer from September until fund transfer day and then 18 months after that date.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I introduced my comments on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill</XREF>  last night and I take this opportunity to complete my contribution to the  discussion of this bill. The first thing I want to do is refer to comments that I heard from the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) on Canberra radio this morning. The member for O'Connor, in response to a protest being conducted around Parliament House at present, made the claim that these amendments to the Native Title Act make no provision at all for the extinguishment of native title. He challenged anyone to identify areas of this bill where native title is extinguished. Let me indicate at least two areas of this amending legislation where that quite clearly occurs. Proposed new section 23G of the bill says that prior grants of non-exclusive pastoral or agricultural leases will have extinguished native title to the extent of any inconsistency and any such extinguishment will be permanent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also draw attention to that first area of the bill which quite clearly makes provision for the extinguishment of native title, despite the claims by the member for O'Connor to the contrary. Let me draw the House's attention to proposed new section 24MD. It provides 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9446"> for the extinguishment of native title through compulsory acquisition by government of such title as the means by which `non-exclusive' leases are upgraded to `exclusive' leases. This section also provides for  compensation to the native title holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am concerned about is that the member for O'Connor would make the claim that this legislation does not extinguish native title when, quite clearly, it does. The question I raise is this: if, in the face of the fact that this legislation quite clearly extinguishes native title, the member for O'Connor, who has a responsibility to the government in this area of public policy, makes the claim that it does not, why does he make that claim? There is only one explanation for that&mdash;that is, the provisions to extinguish native title provided for and contained within this legislation are completely unconscionable. So what the government does and what government spokesmen attempt to do is deny that extinguishment is contained within the legislation when, quite clearly, it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This consideration of amendments to the Native Title Act that we are undertaking at the moment comes at the end of a number of very significant developments which have taken place in the last 30 years in connection with the rights of Aboriginal people as citizens of Australia and as the original owners of this whole continent. Firstly, there was the 1967 referendum. The amendment to the race provision of the  constitution is one of the points which is under some dispute concerning its legal implications and whether or not that provision of the constitution can be used by any government against any racial group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I participated in the debates at that time and I voted and I have no doubt, nor would anyone else who participated at that time have any doubt, that the Australian people amended that section of the constitution to ensure that the Commonwealth government would be able to legislate in favour of Aboriginal people and not to their detriment. There is no question that any single person who voted in that referendum in 1967 believed that they were empowering the Commonwealth government to legislate prejudicially against Aborigines. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next development was the Mabo judgment which repudiated forever that absurd concept of terra nullius&mdash;the idea that this Australian continent was unoccupied prior to European settlement and, for that reason, was unowned.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had the Native Title Act 1993. I want to emphasise that, at that time, negotiations between the Labor government, which was responsible for that legislation, and Aboriginal Australians were conducted. Agreements and understandings were reached. Concessions and compromises were made and the general principles of that Native Title Act emerged from those discussions, from those honourable agreements which this government is now attempting to set aside and to repudiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said last evening that I acknowledge that there are parts of the native title legislation which need to be streamlined and which need to be clarified, but I am aghast that members of the government would use that fact to condemn the whole of the native title legislation. I have never seen a more cynical approach to any piece of legislation&mdash;or for the purposes of any amendment in this chamber&mdash;than the attitudes which have been expressed by members on the government side. For example, they have made the observations that, since Aboriginal people are more concerned about employment, education, health, housing and sanitation, we should forget native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal Australians are in need of many things, including an honourable and an honest recognition by all Australians of the principle of native title, which is a common law right&mdash;and there should not be any attempt made by legislation moving through this parliament to deny that common law right. The Wik decision is again based on the common law rights of Aboriginal people. The decision made it perfectly clear that pastoral rights of leaseholders and the native title rights of Aboriginals do coexist but, in cases where they are in conflict, the rights of the pastoral leaseholders will prevail. Graziers in Australia wanted certainty; they were given certainty in that decision: in cases of conflict, their interests will prevail. And that is not enough. It is not enough for the government and for those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9447"> forces behind the government which are forcing their hand, I believe, at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have got some serious doubts about whether the government really want this legislation to go through. That might sound surprising but I do have genuine doubts about that. They know that it is very likely that the Senate will not pass the legislation. They know that, if the Senate were to pass the legislation, litigation would hold it up in the courts forever. There would be multiple claims and there would be continuing litigation before the High Court, so it would all be delayed. It would be confusing; it would be expensive. There would be massive compensation involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what does this attempt, or alleged attempt, on the part of the government to enact this amending legislation allow them to do? It allows them to go back to their constituents&mdash;to those people who have misrepresented the impact of the principle of native title&mdash;and say, `We fought the good fight. We took all of those opposition forces right to the line. We did our best but we were rolled.' So I do have very serious reservations about the purposes of the government in pursuing this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said that the pastoralists and the miners wanted certainty and the Native Title Act and particularly the Wik decision gave them certainty. We do not hear so much about certainty any more. What we hear about now is security, but security for whom&mdash;for the dispossessed or for the expropriators? Let me say&mdash;and I am interrupting myself on this matter, Mr Speaker&mdash;that I recognise myself as a receiver of stolen goods, as a receiver of stolen property, because Australia was settled by Europeans but we now accept that terra nullius was an unsound concept. Aboriginal Australians occupied and owned the whole of this continent, but now I own pieces of it. I did not buy it from them. It was expropriated from them and transferred to me, and every person with any property rights in Australia is in exactly the same position. The pastoral rights have been confirmed as being supreme. As far as mining and exploration are concerned, the arrangements should be negoti 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ated, but this amending legislation also attempts to upset that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not lose sight of the fact that there are very, very serious legal doubts about the legitimacy of the changes proposed in this legislation&mdash;whether it is contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act and whether the constitution itself will allow this legislation to be effected, even if it does become part of the law. I have indicated that there will be massive litigation and massive compensation. And will it improve the position of the pastoralists&mdash;the leaseholders? The answer, quite clearly, is no. In fact it will disadvantage them; it will be prejudicial to them. The whole question of their right and their capacity to utilise the land for pastoral purposes will be placed in very serious jeopardy and it surprises me that they are not aware of that. It surprises me that they do not act accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the two particular provisions in the constitution are the race power, section 51(xxvi), and the external affairs power, section 51(xxix), under which this legislation almost certainly will be challenged and very likely will be successfully challenged if in fact it is passed by this parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words about the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , because in my mind there is no more significant area of concern for Australia than trying to overcome the tragic divisions that have emerged in the treatment of the original inhabitants of Australia, or those who came here 50,000 years ago or whenever it was, and those who came only 200 years ago. It is an extraordinarily difficult and challenging time. As a member of successive governments and oppositions, I do not think any government has yet got it right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are enormous problems in trying to identify ways by which we can give Aboriginal Australians the same hope and the same opportunities as every other Australian. I do not believe you can achieve it by isolating them. I have not been to South Africa, other than to pass very briefly through the airport at Johannesburg, but I would not want any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9448"> thing parallel to apartheid to be introduced into this country. I think we have to find ways, therefore, by which we can learn to live with all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I totally reject the views of the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). It is very important for today's Australians and future Australians that they learn to live with people whatever their racial or religious origins. We do not want to introduce into this country divisions, whether they be based on race, religion or origin. We certainly do not want to introduce divisions on the basis of the colour of a person's skin. We have to find a way by which we can accommodate the views of those who make up modern Australia and who, to my mind, have enriched our culture simply because of their diverse backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect those of us who are of Anglo&hyphen;Saxon stock are no different in our belief of where we want Australia to go than those who come from other cultures. I am delighted that in this parliament over the course of time we have had representation&mdash;sadly too few from Aboriginal Australia&mdash;from many people who are not of Anglo&hyphen;Saxon stock. So we start from the basis of looking at a multicultural Australia, although I confess that I was one of those who preferred the one Australia tag to that of multicultural Australia. But they both mean the same thing. They are both directed towards ensuring that people, whatever their origins, learn to live in and identify themselves with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having taken that stance, I think there have been a few  milestones which, tragically, have left some traumas which have emerged in the legislation that we are now addressing. While I know that the then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam believed it was very much in the interests of Australia and in the direction that he would like to see Australia taken, he took two decisions which I believe did not sufficiently address or concern themselves with outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without doubt both his decisions were fundamentally ones that all of us would accept. One had nothing to do with this bill&mdash;that is, giving the people of PNG their independence without giving them the capacity to develop the infrastructures that they so sadly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> needed. This is not the time to talk about PNG, but I believe we should have given them their independence but allowed them to develop not just people at a higher academic level but also the plant operators, the skilled foremen, the people who enable a society to work. If we had done this, many of the problems in PNG might not be as acute as they are today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is another issue, but it is related to the second decision that Gough Whitlam took, which was to give equal pay to Aborigines. Obviously they had to have equal pay; there is no question about that. They had to be brought into Australia. I think it is a condemnation of our constitutional forebears that they did not recognise that Aborigines were equal Australians at the time the constitution was adopted. What should have happened was that, instead of bringing them straight in and giving them equal pay, we should have looked at the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the flow-on&mdash;and it is not a direct flow-on; nobody can attribute it directly but it worries me greatly&mdash;is that so many Aborigines today are dependent on social welfare. Instead of being able to live their own lives and retaining the culture of their people and their past, they depend in one form or another on getting help from the government. This has not overcome the problems identified by the honourable member who preceded me, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), concerning health, education, housing and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those issues alone are not predominant, but it is a damnation of our society that we have such incredibly high mortality rates among Aboriginal females. It is quite appalling that in childbirth they still do not have the facilities that every other Australian enjoys. It is quite pathetic to see children out in the outback&mdash;and I know the outback pretty well&mdash;with flies around them and without appropriate standards of health and hygiene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a matter of blaming the Aboriginal as a person, but payday in some of the Aboriginal settlements is social service day. The way in which, regrettably, so much of that income is spent on alcohol is quite appalling. Alcoholism is a very acute health and social 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9449"> problem for Aborigines. It is something we have to identify, and it is something we have to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think you can divorce any of those issues from this particular legislation, because it is important that we look not just at one aspect of caring for Aboriginal Australians. We have to set goals. My first goal is that I want to try to make all Australians, wherever they come from, equal. I am one of those people who do not believe that it is any longer practical to expect that Aborigines are able to really become equal by getting land alone. I think there are fundamental worries in the way we have addressed the whole question of land title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am one of those people who would have far preferred us to have identified something like the soldier settlement schemes after World War II. I know the Aborigines believe that collective ownership is the way to go, but the sad part is that the structure of our Aboriginal people is changing. They no longer have the relationship to their elders that they once enjoyed. At one stage there used to be a tribal custom and tribal law. The elders, male or female, were able to set the discipline, the tribe administered the discipline and people complied with societal patterns. But the cultural attitudes that their forebears held have changed as much as our forebears' attitudes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that there is no excusing much of the abuse of the past. But I am not talking about the past, I am talking about the future. Part of my worry in addressing the problem we have, to which this legislation and the Mabo legislation took an approach, is that essentially we are addressing by virtue of a High Court decision what is said to be a revocation of a past legal misconception&mdash;that is, that terra nullius was wrong. As far as I am concerned, that today is of historical significance, it is of legal consequence but it is not of future relevance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ought not to be looking backwards, other than to learn from the lessons of the past. I can tell all of you today who are members of the House that, when one has been around here for a while, it is amazing on how many occasions people seek to reinvent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the wheel. But, putting that aside, looking prospectively, we have to find ways to allow us to meet&mdash;I think this is reflected on both sides of this chamber&mdash;those common goals: allowing the incorporation of the future Australia as a place where people, wherever they might have originated, can feel at home, can feel they belong and can make a positive contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in that light that I want to address some of the particularity of the legislation. In relation to the Mabo legislation, instead of looking at just giving common title&mdash;perhaps in some areas common title is the answer&mdash;I would have liked also to have seen a way by which we could have given something like the individual title that soldier settlers enjoyed. People say, `What exactly do you mean?' I can tell you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Torrens title, essentially an Australian land title system, is a remarkable way by which land is identified in Australia. It has been replicated in many countries because of its simplicity of form. It avoids all the problems of old system titles, without going into the legalities of it. In my view it would have been preferable had we looked at ways by which around the suburbs of our major cities and our towns we could have allocated land similar to the way soldier settlement land was allocated. I do not think it is a good idea to have Aboriginal people just living in isolation. I think it would be far better if they were allowed to become part of other communities. I know that to a degree our housing commission people have tried to address this, but what they are still doing is looking at housing commission land as being rented instead of being Aboriginal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to satisfy the problem, I do not believe you ought to look only at those Aborigines who now no longer have a relationship with a particular area of land. We all know that the Aborigines, like most other Australians, have intermarried. The percentage of what one might call full&hyphen;blood Aborigines is now much less than it once was, other than in some parts of Australia. Those who have Aboriginal blood rightly could feel disentitled from legislation such as this. I would have liked to have seen a way by which we could 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9450"> have allocated land on a fee simple basis, much as they are in soldier settlements. You can put a particular type of title on it and allow an incorporation of the land, and all Aborigines can benefit from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what I am concerned about is that we do not just address the land issue. I want to look at the legalities of it briefly because I think the land issue is important, and this legislation only refers to the land. When we were making some amendments to Mabo and when we were looking at the question of where we were going with Wik, I would have preferred to have got a package. In that total package I would have liked us to have been able to say, `This is the way we are going to help you back into becoming part of tomorrow's Australia.' I regret that this legislation, like the Mabo legislation, if I can give it that generic term, really has not done anything to bring Aborigines into tomorrow's Australia; rather, each of them has left marked divisions and a good deal of anxiety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, when I was coming into the House this morning I did not have time to stop and speak to those Aborigines outside. Some of those Aborigines were outside the House when most of us arrived today. They were all there with good intent and good purpose. I understand their concerns. The fact that I do not agree with some of them is incidental. As a politician, you find that there are many people in this place that you do not agree with; but at least you can listen. They have a concern and they would like to find a way by which their concerns could be overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have liked the Mabo and the Wik legislation to have been brought together and I would have liked to have looked at a compact by which we might have been able to offer hopes in each of these areas that many of us feel are critical for the future. Part of it is educational and part of it is going to be societal. I, as one who has lived and worked with Aborigines, can tell you that the real difficulty in my community comes once children reach puberty. They are equal to every other child up until puberty, but by then some of the societal patterns make it difficult for them. Without wishing to judge those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> societal patterns&mdash;for who are we to judge others and their mores and patterns if you are advocating freedom of choice in those areas, as we do in Australia&mdash;it is important to register that they do bear down on equal opportunity for those Aboriginal children as they go into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does this legislation fit into that pattern? I would have preferred a broader pattern and I would have liked there to have been some type of soldier settlement equivalent of allocation of land in the Torrens title system which would have allowed all Aboriginals to benefit so we could go forward into the future. That has not been the case. So let us look at where we are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of aspects that concern me. Some of the interpretation of the position following the introduction by Prime Minister Keating of the Native Title Bill of 1993 has been picked up in the Wik 10-point plan, but I do not necessarily accept that the conclusion there is the only answer. People need to remember that in Prime Minister Keating's second reading speech to the Native Title Bill he said that the government's view is that `under the common law past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title'. He specifically referred to the fact that this was recorded in the preamble of the bill. He also said that there is, therefore, no obstacle or hindrance to renewal of pastoral leases in the future, whether validated or already valid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking at that, let me go back to a fundamental that people need to understand. Nobody questions that, whether or not terra nullius existed, the sovereignty of Australia rests in this parliament, that the colonial transfer of power in 1901, that the constitution of Australia as a Commonwealth of Australia, as a federation, is valid. Nobody questions that in this parliament we have a capacity to legislate. Indeed, if there were a question about it&mdash;and people need to reflect on this&mdash;it would apply equally to the High Court as it would to this parliament. In other words, if we did not have authority to legislate, no more would the High Court have authority, because the High Court was constituted as a product of exactly the same process as we in this place were constituted. Having 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9451"> been thus constituted, we therefore have a capacity to legislate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my mind, therefore, the previous Prime Minister having written into the preamble of the Native Title Bill 1993 and having stated in his second reading speech that under common law past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title, that is the valid position of the law today. I do not accept that there is any way by which native title should apply to pastoral leasehold land. In the High Court's judgment in Wik, Justice Toohey said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is apparent that at one end of the spectrum native title rights may "approach the rights flowing from full ownership at common law".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That essentially was the position looked at with respect to crown land under the Mabo decision and under the Native Title Act 1993. Although that perspective might, in Toohey's words, `approach the rights flowing from full ownership at common law', it does not necessarily say it has to be only by collective ownership. Hence the reference I made a while ago to the alternative. But if I can pick up Mr Justice Toohey again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand they may be an entitlement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`they' being the spectrum native title rights&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"to come on to land for ceremonial purposes, all other rights in the land belonging to another group".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is that area essentially to which this legislation refers. For some time there has been a capacity to recognise ceremonial rights in some areas in some states of Australia. There has certainly been a recognition of sacred sites. We need to identify the difference between sacred sites and `ceremonial purposes'. But within this legislation the product of where we now are is that there is still concern&mdash;in spite of the attempt to resolve the whole question of certainty&mdash;and doubt about some areas within the application of this act. I have mentioned one, that is, the question of pastoral lessees. The second area that concerns me regards the uses and application of land by Aboriginals themselves. I think there is confusion by many of them, and that worries me. That is something which I would have preferred was not resolved only by the courts. Yet I suspect that might be so.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see that my time has nearly expired. In very difficult circumstances the government had little choice other than to legislate. Legislation is essential. I believe we have the power to legislate. I suggest that, because of the preamble to the Mabo legislation, the Native Title Bill, native title has already been extinguished on pastoral lease land. That has not been accepted. Therefore, in this bill it has been only for the period up to the introduction of this legislation or the time when it was first foreshadowed, the High Court decision on the Wik case, that that exemption has been given. I believe that should continue and that on balance the 10-point plan is the best alternative we have available. For that reason, while I am apprehensive about the future, I will support the legislation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

On top of that, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made this issue one of his top priorities. He has within his own portfolio of responsibility carriage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs but has not chosen to enter this debate, is not prepared in this House to back his own legislation. We have clear evidence of a government that is prepared in the most cynical and divisive way to ignore, suppress or remove the rights of indigenous Australians to their land&mdash;rights which are inherent in our constitution and which have been confirmed in successive decisions of this country's High Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has sought to reward those state and territory governments which have acted with forethought in issuing titles over land that may be subject to native title and, therefore, invalid. Not only have they put these titles at risk; they have flouted their responsibility under the Native Title Act. They have spurned the opportunity to at last give indigenous Australians the proper recognition which this nation's history and body of law demands. Instead, the Prime Minister has proposed a 10&hyphen;point plan, a plan which is deficient, a plan which lacks vision and which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9452"> seeks in the most underhanded way to extinguish native title and roll back the clock to a time when the rights of indigenous Australians were subservient to those demands of non-indigenous Australians, a subservience that saw indigenous Australians shot, poisoned and moved off their land and their children stolen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only does the 10&hyphen;point plan and its package demonstrate yet again the Prime Minister's lack of compassion or understanding and the depths of his mean&hyphen;spiritedness; it is wrong&hyphen;headed. It lacks commonsense. A most obvious flaw in this 10&hyphen;point plan and the legislation is the arrogant attempt in this bill to legislate away the common law rights of indigenous Australians. The Howard government has gone well beyond the High Court's determination in relation to native title. In the Wik judgment the court left open the question of suppression or extinguishment. His own Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) fessed up in this chamber when he said on 4 September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that the permanency issue was left unresolved . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister, however, has taken the decision to accept the risk that his own legislation extinguishes native title. And he has compounded the sin by proposing to allow the upgrading of pastoral leases at the expense of native title holders. If there is an upgrade then Commonwealth and state governments must contribute to the cost of that upgrade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this bill the constitutional rights of Aboriginal people are potentially capable of being stripped away while previous entitlements for pastoral leases and activity can in fact be enhanced for private purposes but paid for through the public purse. It is perverse. The constitutional questions raised by this legislation have already been the subject of much public discussion and are to be considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. We have already been witness to this government's shameful attempt to suppress advice to it from the Australian Law Reform Commission. Despite whatever efforts the government might make, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it cannot wish away any unwelcome views and opinions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not my intention in the time I have available to detail all of the legal argument against the legislation. My colleagues have covered that field over and over. It was also very pleasing last night to see the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), a member of the government, have the courage to get up in this place and say that the 10&hyphen;point plan and the legislation are flawed. There ought to be more conscience on that side of the House. Suffice it to say that the issues in question go to matters as diverse as questions related to `just terms' as well as to our international obligations under various United Nations' instruments. The fact that there are so many points on which it is possible to challenge the bill demonstrates the irresponsibility of the Howard government in pursuing this as its chosen course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A focal point of the Prime Minister's rhetoric is the need for certainty and workability. Yet almost by definition this bill would have the opposite impact: it will entrench uncertainty, it will be disruptive and it will cause unnecessary division in the community. It will cost this nation dearly. It will become a barrister's banquet. What comfort does this prospect bring to any of us&mdash;not just indigenous Australians but the farmers, the miners and the rest of the community? And, more particularly, what comfort does it bring to those Australians who live in regional Australia and who have to deal with these issues on a daily basis?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Elements of this bill that do warrant our particular attention are those which deal with indigenous land use agreements, principally sections 24BA and 24EC of the amending legislation. These are elements that provide a framework for the development of negotiated agreements on a regional basis. If there is anything good about the Howard government's 10-point plan, it is only the 10th point dealing with regional agreements. But, even with the commitment to go down the route of regional agreements, aspects of this bill have neutered that approach as a result of the cumulative effect of the other provisions which provide for massive&mdash;not bucketloads 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9453"> but truckloads&mdash;extinguishment and the reduction in the procedural rights afforded to indigenous people, particularly the right to negotiate. The extinguishment of native title and the attack on these procedural rights removes any incentive to negotiate. There is essentially nothing left to negotiate about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In pursuing this course the Howard government has picked the quinella. It has not only taken every possible step to limit the opportunities under the Native Title Act for indigenous Australians to be active and equal participants in the economic mainstream but also sold out on regional Australia. If the Howard way becomes the only way it will become a case of an opportunity lost&mdash;an opportunity to truly explore the creative capacity for coexistence of indigenous rights with those of non&hyphen;indigenous Australians to the benefit of all of us. After all, a central element of the High Court's decision in Wik was the assertion of the coexistence of native title with other interests in land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The negotiation of regional agreements based on the acceptance of the existence and legitimacy of native title does provide a platform for the development of regional economies more broadly. A comprehensive approach to regional development and regional planning has been missing from the Howard government's agenda since the day it took office. Negotiating regional agreements can be a means to recognise and respect indigenous rights and needs while simultaneously addressing many of the deep&hyphen;seated problems faced by regional economies across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this respect, regional agreements can be about regional growth for the benefit of the entire community. In this context I am using the term `regional agreement' to mean negotiated financial and administrative arrangements&mdash;including resource management arrangements&mdash;between indigenous Australians and government and third parties within the regional context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in this approach it is important not to be prescriptive. We need to be flexible, as the arrangements will differ from place to place depending upon the circumstances. However, it is crucial for the process to be driven from the local or the regional level, with maximum 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indigenous participation. Basic to the concept of regional agreements is the understanding that all Australians have rights. The challenge for indigenous Australians is to be able to harness the economic impact of investment spending within their local communities and regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill diminishes the potential for indigenous Australians to have a place at the table. It diminishes their ability to exert some control over what happens in their region. It may come as a surprise to the Prime Minister, but the reality is that native title holders are not going away. Their future is tied to their regions and to regional development. They are dependent for their livelihood on these regional economies and they share this dependency with many non&hyphen;indigenous Australians who have made Australia their home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Century Zinc and the McArthur River Mine are two recent examples where taxpayers have provided or are providing infrastructure or services which are either central to or associated with mine development. For example, in the Northern Territory at McArthur River the haulage road has been paid for between the mine site and its port facilities at Bing Bong Station. What was missing from this deal was any agreement to address the services and infrastructure shortfalls of the Aboriginal people on whose land the mine had been developed. On the other hand, the subsequent deal over Century did include consideration of these issues. That agreement was arrived at under the provisions of the current Native Title Act&mdash;Labor's Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ability of indigenous Australians to negotiate regional or site agreements under the Native Title Act does give them the potential to harness available capital to maximise its benefit for their communities and for their local and regional economies. Without this capacity to influence, the direct benefit from major developments to local and regional economies will be minimal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From experience both in this country and overseas it is clear that without local intervention in infrastructure investment&mdash;whether public or private&mdash;it is likely that local multipliers will diminish because of the nature 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9454"> of corporate practice. Companies are becoming increasingly national and/or global so that purchasing and procurement rely less and less on local suppliers and skilled labour is invariably imported. We have also seen an increase in the use of `fly in fly out' operations in extractive industries, which  further highlights this point. Even when local economies speed up as a result of dramatic increases in infrastructure expenditure, the derived benefits flow, increasingly, to firms and individuals from outside the local area&mdash;including overseas&mdash;as they move to take advantage of the growing economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the acknowledgment of native title and the existence of the Native Title Act provide a unique and vital platform for indigenous Australians to pursue a regional agreements approach. Regional agreements are an important element in the historic reconciliation process, a process which is now clearly at risk because of this government's stubbornness and lack of vision and understanding. Tragically, the Prime Minister is unable to grasp the moment. He is unable to fathom the benefits that would flow from such a regional approach not only to the regions themselves but to the nation as a whole. Regional agreements do have the potential to rearrange political and economic power in this country&mdash;to provide Australians in a geographical community of interest with the possibility of exerting some control over what happens in their communities, giving them ownership of the local agenda rather than imposing it upon them or expecting them to take what is left over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike this government, Labor is committed to treating all Australians equally and to ensuring that they are all given a fair go. We will not sit by as the government emasculates the Native Title Act and tramples on the rights and opportunities that Australia's indigenous peoples have won and have entitlement to. We will not only seek to ensure that the right to negotiate remains strong but do everything possible to support processes developed to facilitate indigenous involvement in agreements over developments on their land.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of this parliament I represent thousands of land&hyphen;holders in central Queensland and hundreds of business people who are caught up in this massive land claim by the Aboriginal community. The people on land in my electorate want certainty, security and ascendancy of land tenure within Australia, and they should have it. The 10&hyphen;point plan provides a large degree of that certainty, but the legislation is still a maze of confusion and it will continue to be a thorn in the side of the process of workability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard a lot of debate from both sides of the House on native title. We are all individuals and we all have the right to put our point of view forward, and that is why I should have the right to put mine, which is only the view of many of the people within my electorate, projected by me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that legitimate land&hyphen;holders will be forced to fight for their rights, possibly without financial support from the government, unlike the indigenous community which has been funded to make these claims, some of which are absolutely ludicrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In central Queensland, native title claims engulf the whole area, regardless of whether or not native title can reasonably be established. Claims lodged by indigenous groups stretch from Wide Bay to Mackay and beyond, including the shires of Belyando, Broadsound, Fitzroy, Calliope, Mount Morgan, Livingstone, Duaringa Peak Downs and Rockhampton. The claimants, which include the Wiri, Yuwiburra, Jangga, Wacca, Darumbal and Birria people, have lodged claims for land, water, air, resources, flora and fauna in these shires. Yet it would appear that claims overlap from one area to another, and even the indigenous people cannot agree on the area they are claiming. The people are also seeking to gain environmental control and to place restrictions on the economic use of resources under the claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the indigenous people cannot agree on their own boundaries, what chance has the pastoralist got? Some pastoralists have two, three, four and sometimes five claims on their property, and I am concerned that they will be tied up in legal wrangles for the next 10 years 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9455"> trying to sort out the mess. It is unfair and poses an enormous burden on the rural sector. It appears to me that every area that can be claimed is being claimed, regardless of whether or not native title can reasonably be established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the subject of compensation, I have to ask this question: why is this generation of people in Australia the one which will have to subsidise the legal, administrative and compensation costs associated with native title claims? Australians who lived here over the past 200 years and theoretically were responsible for taking land from the indigenous people have not paid a thing. Future generations of Australians will not have to pay a cent towards the compensation of native title. Why is this generation responsible for the costs that will be incurred? Why is it that our taxes have to be used to compensate the indigenous people for some of these claims? And why is the current generation of rural producers and miners held to ransom for these claims? Pastoralists and mining companies cannot make a move without the fear that somewhere down the line they may be found guilty of some indiscretion and be made to pay a premium for compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I grew up in the towns of Murgon, Cherbourg and Winton, and I have lived with the Aboriginal people for a long time. I understand their plight and a lot of the concerns that they have. Fair is fair: as far as the land is concerned, they have been here for a long time, but so have the pastoralists&mdash;probably not as long but, let us be very clear, we are another generation of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can see no reason why the people who currently have the land in pastoral leases&mdash;the graziers and so forth&mdash;cannot continue to operate. They have got their land and they should be able to keep control of that land and use it the way they see fit. On the other side of the fence, there is a lot of Crown land out there, and I can see no reason why it cannot be made available. If everybody put their heads together on this thing and were happy to put forward the best point of view to ensure that everybody had a win, and if it were not such a politically debated money 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grab, I think this country would be a lot better off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must have a fair go for all Australians. We should be able to put together a one&hyphen;off package that covers education, health, employment and better living standards for Aboriginal people so that we all live as one within Australia. I look at communities like Woorabinda up in my electorate of Capricornia. People look for employment opportunities there, but it is possible that major employment regimes, industry and those sorts of things at Woorabinda would not work. People who need to get employment need to be brought in to live with the rest of the community, and that is how I feel on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, the legislation does not go far enough to fix the problems that many of the graziers and pastoralists are going to have, particularly up in Queensland, but I concede that it is a long way better than this country would have if we worked on what Labor was to introduce. Mr Keating, the previous Prime Minister, said that native title would be extinguished by pastoral leases. I can see no reason why this should not happen.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  in a slightly different context. I think we need to cast our minds back a few centuries to when the major powers in the world were in the process of colonising all of the world. The fact is that most countries in the world were once colonies. Whether they were colonies of Britain, France, Belgium, Germany or Holland, the fact is that the majority of countries were colonies. The South American countries, the African countries, Australia and most Asian countries were colonies. Under the attitudes of the day, that seemed to be appropriate. The colonisation was not simply physical; it was cultural, religious and very materialistic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ever since then there has been an attempt to reconcile that process, and we have seen the emancipation of country after country, culture after culture and religion after religion as countries were given recognition and the right to determine their own affairs. That has not always been easy, because the so&hyphen;called civilised world imposed on the so&hyphen;called 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9456"> uncivilised world frameworks which were often inappropriate and incredibly paternalistic. In many of those colonising processes, there was a recognition of indigenous people, and I think New Zealand stands out as one of the stark examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also the fact that, for hundreds of years, there were rebellions, revolts and struggles by people throughout the world to assert their rights over their own territory. I can recall being in Guatemala in the late 1980s as part of an international conference, talking to the indigenous people there and recognising the struggle that they were still having. It became obvious that people of 14 and 15 were being killed to try to establish that they had equal rights as citizens. I can recall being in Dili in 1991, talking to East Timorese people and Bishop Belo, and looking at and trying to understand what they were trying to assert in terms of what they felt as indigenous people with the right to express their own cultural identity and with some sovereignty over what had been their country pre&hyphen;colonisation by, firstly, the Portuguese and, secondly, the Indonesians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened in Australia was very unusual because the British colonisers of Australia introduced a legal fiction. They pretended there was no&hyphen;one here, so the terra nullius doctrine, for hundreds of years, gave a legal fiction to what was going on. This effectively meant that there was neither the need nor the compulsion nor the demand to reconcile the colonising culture with the indigenous culture. It has fallen to this generation to address that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find those people who keep talking about judge&hyphen;made laws absolutely hypocritical because the same people have vaunted, and have spoken with great gusto about, the British common law system being the world's best legal system. We have talked about that for centuries. We have extolled it around the world. The fact is that the British common law system started to recognise native title in Africa in particular a long, long time ago. So native title did not start in Australia with our communities; it started in Africa last century and was identified and defined then.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After colonisation over 200 years ago, our indigenous people finally went to court and tested the British common law system. The Mabo decision was the first time ever that the Australian High Court was asked to arbitrate and to rule on the basis of British common law as to whether or not the indigenous people of Australia had any legal rights of title. I notice some of the Independent members shaking their heads. The fact is that that was the first time ever. The British common law said, in the High Court judgment, that they have rights and the rights are under native title, which is different to Torres title and different to all other kinds of titles. It was a concept recognised a century before and more. It was a concept recognised by the British colonial officers but not recognised by Australian administrators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After us extolling our legal basis for so long, then having it tested in the High Court and our indigenous people being given, for the first time in over 200 years, some legal rights of title to land&mdash;and a very limited title&mdash;we have decided that somehow this cannot be true. What we are engaged in right now, if you like, is a 20th century colonisation. The first colonisation was with guns, with power, with disease and with deprivation; the new wave of colonisation is wiping out British common law. It is no different. We took away their rights, as colonisers, and pretended they did not exist. But hundreds of years later it was established, with incredible patience and stamina, that they do have rights. The new wave colonisers are us, right now in this parliament. This parliament is engaged in an act right now of recolonising Australia, by doing with this parliament and this legislation what the early colonisers failed to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue has ramifications way beyond that. When people want to start looking at Australia's stature in the world and how the world sees us, just keep in mind that most of the world's countries were ex&hyphen;colonies&mdash;and most ex&hyphen;colonisers have got out of the business. You do not see Germany colonising countries any more and you do not see Britain colonising countries any more; we are the only ones. We are now leading the charge for new style colonising.</PARA>

It is simply a modern form of poisoning their waterholes. It is simply a modern form of destroying their religions and destroying their culture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is confrontationist, it is divisive and it is bound to fail. There is no doubt that the High Court will not uphold this legislation. This legislation will not give certainty. The only way we can progress is if we firstly recognise and respect both the rights and the needs of indigenous people. We must deal with that as a society. These people are part of our society. They have rights within our society. Any difficulties with how their rights and the rights of other people intercept need to be reconciled. Reconciliation is not simply saying that we will all talk to each other and start to change the way we treat each other. Reconciliation has to incorporate, fundamentally, recognition of the rights of each.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that British common law determinations in two cases&mdash;first, Mabo and, secondly, Wik&mdash;said that our indigenous people have substantial rights. Those rights are now defined and need to be reconciled. Those who talk about reconciliation on one hand and extinguishment on the other are playing some kind of mind game, and it will not work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, around the world Australia will be seen as a pariah. This is not to say that we should do in Australia what other countries want us to do. But, just remember, we are putting ourselves in the same league as the colonisers of centuries ago. We are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9458"> now the modern colonisers of the world, and we are probably the only ones&mdash;apart from the occasional American venture into various parts of South America or Asia, and even they have stopped. We are now the only country in the world which is colonising, but in a very sophisticated form, with all the glib words that the highest priced wordsmiths can muster in an attempt to obfuscate, obscure and pretend. We are doing it by divisive and emotive tactics in pitting Australian against Australian, indigenous against non-indigenous. What is taking place, I think, is an absolute national tragedy. But I do not think the majority of Australians will fall for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People talk about the Mabo legislation, its preamble and the comments made by the previous Prime Minister. The fact is that they have been borne out. The Wik judgment said that, if there is any conflict, that a lease has priority. That is absolutely clear. The idea somehow that there is uncertainty is nonsense. There is no uncertainty because the pastoral lease takes precedence over native title&mdash;and that is what was expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing here is a political charade of sinister magnitude. It is a pretence that, firstly, the common law is somehow judge made. It is not. It never has been before. We have never seen in England a campaign against their judges for making common law decisions as we are seeing here. We then vaunt this common law concept as being the world's best system. We are pretending that certainty requires ownership only, and nothing else. We are pretending that, to do that, we will not be involved in massive cost and massive disenfranchisement or massive loss of legal rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole exercise is aimed at polarising and dividing. The only answer is for a negotiated outcome to be arrived at by those of us with responsibility for legislation and those people with rights&mdash;a negotiated outcome with which we can all live with dignity. This is not dignified; it is despotic. It is a parliament overriding common law judgment in two judgments. I have no doubt that, when this goes back to the High Court, it will be rejected again.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole thing is a charade, and that is reinforced absolutely by the government's actions with the Law Reform Commission. If they are so confident that their legal grounds are unshakeable, why gag the Law Reform Commission? If they are so confident that the High Court has made a mistake, why not allow into the public arena every bit of legal advice available? Why not allow a committee to discuss and question officers of the Law Reform Commission? If they are so confident that we are acting within the British common law system and doing it properly, why not allow really full debate on the stolen generation, and why not have a detailed response?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are doing in this parliament at this point in time is creating a massive problem not just for ourselves but for generations ahead. The world is watching us with interest as a country that talked with some right, if you like, about events in other countries. We fought in two world wars in the cause of freedom and civil rights. We speak on these issues constantly as a country. And what are we actually doing? We are removing civil rights, we are removing legal rights, because it does not suit us. I think Australia's status in the world is important to all of us. We are a small but incredibly fair country historically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening here is not fair. It will not stand up in court. It will lead to more uncertainty, to more division and to more hostility, and at the end of all that someone is going to have to sit down and negotiate a solution. Some time in the future someone is going to have to sit down with parliamentarians, with executive government, with indigenous people, and negotiate a solution which is compatible. This legislation does the opposite. It says, `We know what is best. We will override the laws.' It will do a whole range of things which, quite frankly, most of us find incomprehensible. There are pages and pages of schedules of lease after lease. I suppose the fact that the leaseholders include the Sultan of Brunei and God knows who else makes a sham of it all. We try to get a list of how many leases there are, how many leaseholders there are, who they are, and we do not know.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9459">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In amongst all of this there is one interesting point. The leases in South Australia in so many cases enshrine within them the right for indigenous people to access that land. In other words, our forefathers were actually reasonably aware in some cases. I think the contrast between the British Colonial Office and the Australian administrations in treatment of Aboriginal land rights and access to land is an incredible one. We are taking the side of the early administrators in Australia. We are denying centuries of history of British common law and British common practice. We chose a model which no&hyphen;one else has. What is more, what we are doing today in this legislation is taking it a step further. It is a dark step, it is a nasty step, and it will not succeed in creating certainty and correctness.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has introduced the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  to solve a variety of numerous and complex problems. The issue of the existence of native title has been of concern to all those with an interest in land use in Australia, in particular indigenous Australians, pastoralists and graziers and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mining and resources industry. In June 1992 in the Mabo case the High Court held that the common law recognised native title rights and that those rights could survive white settlement. Native title was described by reference to the traditional laws and customs of indigenous people. However, the court said that native title is susceptible to extinguishment. This could occur, for example, by way of laws or acts giving rights to third parties inconsistent with the continuation of native title rights and by laws or acts by which the Crown obtains full beneficial ownership of land previously subject to native title. Native title can also be lost if indigenous people fail to maintain their traditional connection with the land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then in late 1993 the parliament enacted the Native Title Act. One of the premises on which that act was based, recorded in the preamble to the act, was parliament's understanding that native title is extinguished by valid government acts inconsistent with its continuing existence, such as the grant of freehold or leasehold title. However, the act did not expressly extinguish native title over all pastoral leases. In June 1993, before the Native Title Bill was introduced into the parliament, the Wik peoples began, by proceeding in the Federal Court, a claim for title over 35,000 square kilometres of land on western Cape York. Their case was sent to the High Court and a decision was handed down on 23 December 1996. One of the major questions in the Wik case was whether the grant of the particular pastoral leases in question gave the lessees exclusive possession of the land, a right inconsistent with the continuation of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the risk of oversimplifying a complex and detailed decision, I briefly say that the majority of the court concluded that the leases in question did not confer exclusive possession on the lessees. The court confined its attention to the particular leases at issue and held that they did not necessarily extinguish native title. The importance of the Wik decision lies in the fact that an estimated 42 per cent of the Australian land mass is under pastoral lease. In some states, the percentage 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9460"> is estimated to be as high as 70 per cent to 80 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since it came into force in 1994, the act has placed a burden on resource development without benefiting indigenous people. As the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) said in his second reading speech, this is of concern because, as a result of the unresolved uncertainties left by the act, community relations in many parts of rural and remote Australia have been strained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is salutary to look closely at the impact of native title on the mining and exploration industry to understand the problems with the current act. The risks for mining companies arising from native title are greater in my home state of Western Australia than in any other state or territory. This is because Western Australia produces 36 per cent of Australia's mineral resources, and 82 per cent of the state is subject to native title claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty for the mining industry arises from what is known as the right to negotiate. The right to negotiate is a right given by the act to registered native title holders and to those who have registered but not proven a claim to native title. It entitles them to negotiate about certain actions that are proposed by governments that may affect their native title, or claim to native title, on land or waters. My colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) is going to deal with claims on waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Actions that attract the right to negotiate include the creation or variation of a right to mine. In an article in the September 1997 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Mining Monthly</EMPHASIS>, the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies Inc., otherwise known as AMEC, described the right to negotiate as `the most criticised and demonstrably biggest problem with the current act'. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It enables exploration and mining companies to be held to ransom before native title has been awarded to any applicant.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on to say that the right to negotiate is `the single biggest impediment in the act to any type of development in Australia and nothing is doing more to constrain employment opportunities, delay projects or inflate costs'. AMEC claims that the effect on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mining industry is an escalating flight of mining capital offshore. This claim appears to be borne out by the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released in January 1997 showed that Australian resident companies spent $486 million on exploration for minerals and petroleum overseas in 1995-96. That represents an increase of 12.8 per cent on the previous financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent Minerals Council of Australia minerals industry survey showed that the overseas portion of the respondents' exploration spending had grown steadily over the years, from 30.1 per cent of total exploration in 1988-89 to 40.5 per cent in 1995-96. I am told by AMEC that offshore operation, which formerly was not economically viable for the smaller mining companies, is now being seen by those companies as increasingly attractive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be of concern that, according to AMEC, a large proportion of the exploration that is going offshore is so-called `green fields' exploration. This term refers to exploration of areas not previously mined or explored to any large extent and where the mineral potential is unknown. It is designed to initiate new mining operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previous Minerals Council surveys reveal that the impact of the movement in investment overseas is already being felt on green fields exploration activity in Australia. Australian mining companies are choosing to spend a larger proportion of their domestic exploration budget on `brown fields' exploration. Brown fields exploration, as you probably know, Mr Deputy Speaker, is designed to feed existing mining infrastructure and usually occurs in an area adjacent to existing explored or mined reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full impact of this trend will not become evident for several years, when the overseas green fields exploration begins to bear fruit. Since the metal produced overseas is the product of that country, that metal will compete with the Australian product if traded in the same market. Clearly, something must be done to reverse this alarming trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its analysis of the minerals industry survey, the authors noted that various factors 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9461"> contributed to the driving of minerals exploration investment offshore. These factors include environmental requirements, overall costs and fiscal settings. Changing geopolitical conditions and the opening up of various countries in South America, Asia and Africa to foreign investment are additional factors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The authors of the survey reiterated the industry's firm view that the Native Title Act has introduced significant uncertainty to exploration approvals process in Australia and, in doing so, has encouraged this movement overseas. The industry pleads for a working legislative system that recognises the realities of the commercial and competitive environment in which mineral companies operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This need is by no means inconsistent with the right of indigenous people to have their interest in land recognised appropriately and protected. After all, the mining industry has always worked within a legal framework that recognises the interests in land held by non-indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While native title is a unique type of interest in land, quite different from freehold and leasehold interests, it should be possible to establish a fair and practicable way to balance the need to maintain a competitive mining and exploration industry, with the need for indigenous people to enjoy their rights to land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has introduced this bill to amend the act in the light of its serious defects and in response to the Wik judgment. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in this place on 4 September this year that the government seeks with these amendments to give security and predictability to the farmers of Australia and to the mining industry and to preserve the `basic fabric of the rights conferred by the High Court of Australia on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community in the historic Mabo decision'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Nick Minchin, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, with responsibility for native title, has described this amendment bill as fulfilling four objectives: to reduce uncertainty; to improve the workability of native title processes; to find 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a balance among the interests of all parties; and to maintain respect for native title. Senator Minchin has said that the proposed legislation comprises amendments formulated in 1996 to improve the workability of the act, together with amendments developed this year under the government's 10-point plan to deal with the uncertainty arising from the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question before the parliament is whether or not this bill will make the native title procedure more workable and provide greater certainty to all parties while recognising the concerns of indigenous people. The government proposes in the bill what it asserts to be a more efficient management of native title claims. In a move aimed at reducing division and litigation, the amendment bill provides for more flexibility in agreements involving native title claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment bill provides for the validation of acts or grants on pastoral leases and other coexisting tenures between 1 January 1994, when the Native Title Bill came into effect, and the date of the Wik decision. It confirms the extinguishment of native title on exclusive tenures. It provides what is intended as a more effective and efficient regime for the consideration of mining applications on land where native title may exist. The amendment bill ensures the supply of government services on land on which native title may exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Addressing the major concern of miners, the bill tightens the test for the registration of a native title claim requiring indigenous people to first establish that they have a prima facie claim to native title. That will ensure that mining companies are only required to negotiate in cases in which native title is most likely or probable to be found. In the words of the Attorney-General, that will provide more of a balance between the interests of native title holders and the need to ensure that economic development is not unduly impeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of mining on leasehold land where native title may exist, the states and territories will be able to replace the right to negotiate with state based systems that give equivalent procedural rights to native title holders, claimants and leaseholders. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9462"> amendment bill removes the right to negotiate from those small scale mining operations which would become unviable if required to comply with the negotiation procedures. Examples of such operations are opal, gem and alluvial gold mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that the bill will go some way towards assisting the competitiveness of the mining industry and encouraging investment to remain in Australia by reducing some of the obstacles to resolving native title issues. The amendment bill also contains benefits designed for pastoralists. The bill confirms the High Court ruling that the statutory rights of pastoral lessees prevail over any surviving native title rights. In so doing, the amendment bill ensures that the work of a pastoralist will not be disrupted by native title issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, by guaranteeing that governments can manage and regulate water supplies, notwithstanding any coexisting native title rights, the bill will protect the pastoral industry's access to water. Provisions in the bill before the House ensure that lessees can be granted additional primary production rights such as farmstay tourism. Our primary producers must be encouraged to diversify in order to meet the changing needs of Australian and international markets and to help with the viability of farming enterprises and rural communities. If this bill assists to prevent native title issues from discouraging diversification on pastoral lease land, it will be most welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the balance sought to be struck by the bill, the proposed legislation will provide specific benefits, which I listed earlier, for indigenous people. The amendment bill also confirms the existing access to pastoral leases for registered native title claimants. This bill, if enacted, will give equivalent treatment for native title claimants and  pastoralists in relation to mining and other development on pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment bill also sets out appropriate powers and functions for indigenous representative bodies, with the aim of ensuring that they perform properly and are accountable. I support the government's view that the parties to a native title claim should 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be encouraged to negotiate a land use agreement. An agreement, which by definition is consensual, is preferable to litigation, which is potentially divisive and always costly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the comprehensive framework set out in the bill for reaching agreements is of benefit to all parties, I expect it will be particularly useful for indigenous people. It appears unlikely that the parliament will produce a legislative solution to the question of the use of land over which native title exists that pleases all parties. A strength of this bill is its emphasis on encouraging parties to reach negotiated agreements. It is a mature approach to an issue that, to date, has unfortunately been characterised by its use by some parties as a platform for various political agendas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While confirming and securing the rights of native title holders, the government has sought to accommodate the competing interests of other Australians who also hold titles to land. This reconciliation&mdash;I use word advisedly&mdash;of competing land use interests is important not just for Australian industry but also for the improvement of relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. I commend the government for what it has done with this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

Some of them have been quite extraordinary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The trouble is it would not mean anything more than that. But I want to make this assertion: there must be, in the interests of Australian people, a differentiation between laws or, let us say, sentiments that are designed to make some people feel better or feel good versus what is, in essence, good government. We have seen in recent times just how emotive the issue of property rights can become. I use the example&mdash;I am not trying to offend the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), who is at the table, because it is not her particular portfolio&mdash;of the nursing homes rules changes where people who have homes or properties who have faced the prospect of paying an accommodation bond become very emotionally involved in these changes. We can see where for instance what might be presented as an example of good government can suddenly get out of hand because there is a very strong emotional bond between citizens and their property.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a person who supports property rights, as I am sure the coalition philosophically supports property rights&mdash;or at least it used to in the past&mdash;I think there is an obvious requirement for any legislation that intends to deal with property rights to take into account the wishes of the vast majority of Australian citizens because, clearly, it is a matter that impacts on all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned also that there was a very big cheek in the statements made by a delegation of British MPs relating to the government's Wik legislation. What an absolute cheek! And the fact that the Labor Party is taking comfort in comments made by British MPs is extraordinary. For instance, could one have asked the same MPs who made those statements whether they are going to kick in some money to clean up the mess at Maralinga? Will they compensate for the genocide wreaked on Tasmanian Aborigines by British colonial troops? Will they compensate the descendants of the Tolpuddle Martyrs? What about the children who were sent to Australia, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as evidenced in the program dramatisation <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Leaving of Liverpool</EMPHASIS>?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rapers and pillagers&mdash;particularly, I would say, in the lowlands of Scotland. Some were descended from the Norman invaders who dispossessed the Britons who were there in the first place. If I were a British visiting MP, I would keep pretty quiet about land rights. The other, more sinister, threat that they were making was about interfering in the enjoyment of many citizens around the world&mdash;not only Australian citizens&mdash;of the Sydney Olympics. I think it is something that we really ought to look at a little more seriously because, quite clearly, they are designing to destabilise the efforts Australia is making to present itself in the best light at the Sydney 2000 Olympics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also say that the question of property rights is something that I think fits hand in hand with some of the recent articles in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> relating to this sense of insecurity that is becoming more and more prevalent in our community, particularly in relation to job security but also in the case of the connection or identification of people with their property rights and the way in which business is transacted by commercial and government interests. So when they see this type of debate over legislation, which is conducted in some cases in an atmosphere of almost near hysteria, then there is in some of what I consider mainstream Australians a growing sense of despair and despondency about the way in which their country is being run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that when you consider other circumstances relating to recent events following the Mabo and the Wik decisions&mdash;and I look back to those days; I am going to talk about this in a second&mdash;about the days following the Mabo decision and then the native title legislation and the Aboriginal Land Fund Bill, you have to see where people can become exasperated and frustrated with the way in which they see their government behaving. I also might add at the same time the fact 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9464"> that, in the same sort of atmosphere, we have seen that landmark report launched by the Governor&hyphen;General in relation to Aboriginal health outcomes. This is something that I think many Australians really look at and wonder and scratch their heads as to why we have allowed this particular situation to continue to exist. It exists even now, notwithstanding the best efforts of people who have endeavoured to solve or to try to ameliorate these sorts of problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a problem in many remote and, for that matter according to the health outcomes report, rural towns with the fringe dwellers and also in the metropolitan areas. The health outcomes were equally unsatisfactory or disgraceful in all three areas, and that is after substantial amounts of Australian taxpayers' money have been spent. And the question has to be asked: should those people who were responsible for the administration of those policies, those people who were the stewards of the policies that consumed those vast amounts of resources have to accept responsibility for the failure of the outcomes? They must do; that is a normal thing. The previous Labor administration&mdash;and, I might say, the previous coalition administration before that&mdash;obviously shunned and tried to avoid the responsibility that they must suffer for these particular matters remaining the same as they were over such a long period of time. The question is, in trying to overcome the dilemma posed by the Wik decision and by the failure of the Keating native title legislation, whether or not the Howard government's legislation or amendments will in fact work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it clear that I reject the opposition claims that the kind of legislation that we have before us is not needed to remedy the situation in regard to native title. That is an absolutely extraordinary assertion on the part of legislators when you consider the legal maze or minefield&mdash;using an analogy of recent note&mdash;of problems in resolving the question of land title, the question of access and the use of that particular land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court in its Mabo decisions made legislation necessary to ensure that fairness applied to native title claimants and to other 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interested parties alike. In other words, there was a need for a legislative response but, unfortunately, the Native Title Bill was the wrong response. It has exacerbated the problem. The Labor government believed, when they proposed their act, that pastoral leases extinguished native title. They advised the community that this was the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was going to make some direct quotations in response to the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), but the point was that there was an agreement between the various parties concerned at the time based on the assumption that native title was extinguished in the case of leasehold property. These statements were unequivocal. Gareth Evans, the now Deputy Leader of the Labor Party and then Attorney-General, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the High Court will confirm that properly granted pastoral leases . . . do in fact extinguish native title. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said as much. That is our legal judgement, that is our belief . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the sort of contribution that he has made. In the first instance they predicated their legislation on the basis that leasehold grants had extinguished native title. Clearly, one would have assumed that they accepted that to be reasonable.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point was that, at the time the legislation was being debated, it was predicated on this basis. Whether or not the High Court accepted it, it is a fact that this parliament has a responsibility to legislate. It should not sit back and idly wait for judges to make law. We should be legislating to ensure that the laws are clear, unequivocal and in black and white for the benefit of all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former minister Collins, speaking two days later about Queensland pastoral leases, added, `If those titles are valid, they extinguish native title.' The real problem as we know it is that the High Court did not confirm the previous government's view, and in the Wik decision decided that pastoral leases did not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9465"> necessarily extinguish native title. As a result, a great deal of further uncertainty and confusion have clouded the concept of land use and the issue of rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Action has to be taken by the parliament to remedy the situation. We are charged with that responsibility. This is the place where the people's representatives make the laws. It is our responsibility to respond, not merely to stand back and wait for the next High Court decision. In my view, action is essential if we are to maintain our nation's parliamentary tradition where the parliament makes laws and not the judiciary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the previous members in this debate kept going on and on about attacks on the High Court judiciary. It is not an attack on the High Court. The High Court has its role to play in our constitutional system of government, but so do we. We abrogate our responsibility if we do not act. As far as I can see, the real decision to be made is not whether we should change the Native Title Bill 1993 but how far we ought to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has advised us in his second reading speech that, after four years and over 600 claims lodged under the act, there has been only one determination of native title on the mainland of Australia. That is an absolute disgrace. Clearly this is not an example of legislation which is working, and it must change. We have an absolute responsibility to ensure this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard it said that the issue of native title is now like a train which has built up momentum and is out of control. It seems inevitable that the train will crash, but the main priority of members of the Australian Democrats and some in the Labor Party seems to be to make sure that the public have the perception that they are not driving the train. Both the Labor Party and the Democrats were happy to allow pastoral leases to extinguish native title when it was predicated in the 1993 bill. Yet they claim that this new legislation, which does not even go that far, unfortunately, is flawed because it impinges on the rights of traditional owners or because it may breed more uncertainty. This is gross hypocrisy on the part of those who make that claim.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that a genuine attempt has been made in good faith by the government to resolve the issue of native title via the now famous 10&hyphen;point plan. Unfortunately, the process is being captured by the key players or interest groups as determined by the government. I am not sure whether the government's legislation will solve the problems that it has attempted to solve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those groups include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, mining companies, pastoralists and businesses such as professional fishermen. I do not intend going over the ground already covered by many government and non&hyphen;government members on behalf of their own people other than to reiterate that there is an absolute need for fairness, transparency and equality in resolving the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am interested, however, to note the facts introduced into this debate by the members for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly). Funds were made available largely by the Labor government to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to purchase land as compensation where native title was alleged to have been extinguished. From 1980 to 1989&mdash;prior to native title&mdash;the Aboriginal Development Commission bought 145 properties for Aboriginal communities at a cost of $32.2 million. From 1990 to 1996, ATSIC spent $89 million on the purchase of 196 properties. From 1993 to the year 2004, the Indigenous Land Fund has a target balance of $1.289 billion with an annual draw down of $45 million in perpetuity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, who make up less than two per cent of the population, now own or control 15.3 per cent of Australia or 117 million hectares. This is an area greater than the size of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT combined. It is certainly greater than the area of the United Kingdom, Germany and France combined. This does not include private land tenures held by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to the point that the wider community have a right to be involved in the dispersal of land ownership and land rights in this country. They have not had the opportunity to be directly consulted, unless you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9466"> consider some of the public opinion polls to be an adequate measure of the national view. This is unfortunate because one must recognise that there are broad public areas which must be considered. Take ownership and access to national parks and fishing rights as two examples. I have seen claims by a previous executive director of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Mr Jim Downey, that Aboriginal Australians could own 95 per cent of all national parks within 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is to be arrived at through this legislation, we should be sure of what the broader community feel about this. They have a right to be involved in the allocation of ownership of national parks, which are an inseparable element of our national estate. They have been set up by various governments over many years with an expectation that they will guarantee public access and appreciation of the natural diversity of our nation. Private ownership of any such assets must be detrimental and will amount to nothing short of the needs of the many being subjugated to the needs of the few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My second example relates to fishing in Australia. As members are aware, native title claims exist for or have the potential to apply to much of our nation's coastline, estuaries, rivers, lakes and impoundments and to various offshore locations. I noted with interest that the Australian Seafood Industry Council was happy with and supportive of the government's legislation. The ASIC advised that it was content that its quiet lobbying had ensured that its interests had been included in the 10&hyphen;point plan. It pointed particularly to point 8, which sought to guarantee that `the ability of governments to regulate and manage surface and subsurface water, offshore resources and airspace and the rights of those with interests under any such regulatory or management regime, would be put beyond doubt'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is less clear is how recreational fishermen will be affected by native title claims. I spoke on this way back in November 1993, when Labor introduced its Native Title Bill. I am forced to reiterate my concerns now, because I do not see the evidence that this bill will protect their interests any 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more than the previous bill did. As I said then, native title legislation can only evoke the same kind of frustration from fishermen as it had from mining leaseholders and some pastoralists. Australians are just as passionate about the ocean&mdash;perhaps in some cases even more so&mdash;as they are about the land. It is as integral in our lifestyle as the great Australian dream of owning your own place. I do not just mean this in the context of a family trip to the beach, but also in relation to the ocean's riches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the concept of claiming ownership of beaches and the seabed was raised at the time of the last bill, David Allen of the Northern Land Council was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the response to such recognition will be even more aggressive than the response over native title to lands . . . not only would commercial fishing interests be affected, but it would touch the hearts of all recreational fishermen. There is, in . . . Australia, a deep tradition that the sea and its resources belong to no-one and that, in a curious way the sea is the ultimately enduring terra nullius.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Many Australians consider recreational fishing rights as their natural birth right and expect them to be guaranteed by the government. It is a legitimate expectation. I would hope that this native title legislation is capable of protecting those interests, but I am not so sure that is the case. I just want to briefly illustrate the potential by way of an example of another native title involving fishing rights. I would like to examine the history of the issue in Washington state, in the United States. Although the circumstances remain different from Australian native title, there are some clear lessons that can be drawn from the experience. I am indebted to American author Steve Raymond's research on this issue. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Salmon were the mainstay of the Indians' life. They returned to the rivers at predictable times each year and the Indians knew this and waited to catch them. Five of the six Pacific salmon species are found here and it seemed as though at least one of them was always running, from spring clear until the early days of winter . . . The Indians fished with dip nets, crude gill nets, reef nets, spears and cleverly constructed traps; they caught fish in weirs and impoundments and they used jigging and trolling methods. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9467">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They fished mostly in the estuaries and rivers, but some ventured into Puget Sound or into the wild north Pacific Ocean. They learned not only the seasons but the locale in which the fish would run and returned there year after year . . . For centuries, the tribes lived in harmony with . . . fish . . . but in the late 18th century, they began . . . a series of brief encounters with . . . white men who appeared off the coast . . . And then the white men began to stay . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A treaty was signed in 1855 which moved the Indians onto reservations but allowed them to retain their fishing rights. The degradation of the environment saw the usefulness of these rights diminish and commercial fishing dramatically reduced the catch. Hatcheries were established to remedy the situation, but really only to benefit commercial fishermen. It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Indians had little hope of obtaining relief in State courts. But federal courts were more friendly to their cause . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In a landmark decision in 1905 a settler was ordered to remove fish traps he had placed in traditional Indian fishing places. The US Supreme Court observed that the Indians' right to fish at their accustomed places was `not much less necessary to the existence of the Indians than the atmosphere they breathed'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1970, 115 years after the treaty, their efforts paid off when the United States, acting as their trustee, represented their rights. But the courts took control of the state's fisheries management and fate then played a cruel trick on the non-Indian fishermen. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most had fished all their lives, just as the Indians had once had; for many, fishing had become a way of life, just as it once was for the Indians. Nearly all considered that fishing was their natural right, just as the tribes had once believed. Suddenly, through circumstances beyond their control, that right had been wrenched away from them, just as it had been taken away from the Indians a hundred years before . . . they felt the same bitter hurt and blind frustration that the Indians had felt . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The recognition of sea rights will involve a conceptual leap for Australians accustomed to the notion of the sea and its resources as a common property over which no-one has priority or exclusionary rights. There is a widely held belief that the ocean and its resources are there for the use and the enjoy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment of all Australians. The real challenge for government is to meet these expectations within a fair plan that guarantees Aborigines are treated equitably in relation to all other Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 may well turn out to be as futile an exercise as was the native title amendment bill of 1996. That bill of course was made redundant by the Wik ruling. This bill could well be invalidated by the outcome of the High Court's decision over the challenge to the Hindmarsh Island act. The problem we all face and which this bill does not address is defining the concept of native title. It does not fit neatly into white man's law. It is rather a label for a bundle of rights over land&mdash;many of which are alien to our system of tenure. I cannot define it, white lawyers cannot define it and this parliament, without one Aboriginal member, tries to speak on behalf of Aborigines or at least to define what it believes to be native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The four majority judges in Wik concluded that undue emphasis should not be placed on notions of leasehold known to the English common law, such as the automatic right of exclusive possession. Rather, said the judges, pastoral leases should be seen as creatures of statutes designed for uniquely Australian conditions. That fact was recognised way back in 1848, when Colonial Secretary Earl Gray stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is essential that it should be generally understood that leases granted give the grantees only an exclusive right for the pasturage of their cattle as they may require within the large limits assigned to them. But these leases are not intended to deprive the natives of their former right to hunt over those districts or to wander over them in their search for subsistence in the manner to which they have been accustomed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So said Earl Gray in 1848. But if 150 years later we are about to upgrade these pastoral leases, which have evolved beyond just cattle grazing to include anything incidental to primary production, no-one could fairly argue that we should at the same time freeze native title holders in a subsistence time warp. They too should enjoy the commercial advantages of their title. They too should, to borrow a phrase from the honourable member for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9468"> Curtin (Mr Rocher), be allowed to diversify their current limited options, even more limited by this bill. We certainly should not limit one title to advantage another. As Michael Warby of the Tasman Institute says in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Past wrongs, future rights</EMPHASIS> :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If indigenous Australians are to build a better future then their legal interest in land should not be in a form `snap-frozen' by legislative fiat. They should be in forms that allow the titleholders themselves the widest possible range of options.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those options can only be determined through consultation and negotiation at a local level. Because native title is not something indigenous people own, native title rights cannot be bought or sold as freehold can, though the loss of native title can be compensated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the Wik case, Senator Bill O'Chee and others have been peddling the myth that native title tenure is the same as freehold title when, if they bothered to look, the courts have repeatedly stated this is not the case. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has insinuated, waving a shaded map of Australia about, that 80 per cent of Australia is up for grabs&mdash;`under threat'. Read `under freehold threat' in that. The NFF's Donald McGauchie says that coexistence of different forms of land tenure is a concept totally alien to our system of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about landlords and leaseholders all over the country? What is so difficult about native title and pastoral rights coexisting? The Australian Law Reform Commission, which has had the apparent temerity, according to some, to comment on this most controversial piece of proposed legislation, has amply highlighted what a legal minefield the bill is. The commission, which the government wants to muzzle because it does not want to hear the message, believes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . not only are the declared objectives of the bill mutually inconsistent but the proposed means by which they are to be achieved are inadequate and counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill, says the commission, will yield `more, not less, litigation and compound uncertainty and lack of confidence in Australian real property law'. The commission also says that there is little doubt that these amendments do not advantage indigenous people, and so bring into play the race power and the intent of the 1967 referendum. This 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> brought Aboriginal people within the head of legislative authority whereby, according to Justice Brennan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The odious policies of oppression and neglect of Aboriginal citizens were to be at an end, and that the primary object of the power is beneficial.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In fact, Australia's international obligations insist that any legislation enacted which impinges upon indigenous people should not disadvantage them. As I suggested in a question in this House on 16 June this year, every point bar 10 of the Prime Minister's 10-point plan, upon which this bill is largely based, disadvantages the Aboriginal people. As the Australian Law Reform Commission points out, by expressly distinguishing potential native title holders from holders of other types of real property title and, on the basis of that distinction, treating them differently, the `formal equality' imperative under sections 9 and 10 of the Racial Discrimination Act is contradicted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 10-point plan and the bill bear no relationship to the common law rights inherent in the Mabo and Wik judgments and will fundamentally restrict the legal rights of native title claimants. In fact, the commission argues&mdash;and I agree:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It could reasonably be argued that, taken together, the voluminous provisions of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 should be characterised as a pastoral lease enhancement measure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As former NFF executive director Rick Farley points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is faced with a gradual realisation by the community and the world of the tragedy of the stolen generation and this government's totally inadequate response.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In this climate the government will have to argue that taxpayers' funds should be used to pay for the acquisition of indigenous native title rights in order to increase pastoralists' rights. Pastoralists will win from this bill because they will have their leases upgraded to allow any activities incidental to primary production as defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other speakers have pointed out that many of these pastoralists are wealthy foreigners, such as the Sultan of Brunei. I ask: why should ordinary Australian taxpayers foot the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9469"> bill to upgrade their investments by giving them virtual freehold title? Why should ordinary farmers in my Calare electorate who have worked hard and invested in freehold land foot the bill to upgrade the title for those people who have paid comparatively minimal amounts for their leases?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pastoralists will also benefit by having the taxpayer fund the just terms compensation which will be needed to compensate for the permanent extinguishment of any native title interests where its continuation is inconsistent with any acts incidental to primary production. However, this permanent extinguishment provision, according to the Law Reform Commission, is legally flawed. The commission says&mdash;and it can hardly be more clearly expressed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments seeking to extinguish permanently native title rights are, therefore, unjustifiable. There appears to be considerable doubt as to the validity of either of the available sources of constitutional authority for the Bill. At the very least, should the Bill be enacted in its present form, there will be substantial grounds upon which it could, and likely will, be challenged before the courts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So not only is this bill morally and politically flawed; it is legally flawed. Let us look at some of the other weaknesses highlight by experts with far more learning than I. It is inconsistent with the requirements of the Racial Discrimination Act. The sunset clause may unknowingly deprive potential native title holders of their rights and be subsequently ruled unjust. It would breach Australia's obligations under international law, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and others would question the conspiratorial nature of these covenants under our United Nations obligations, but so too would such withdrawal from these obligations enable us to ignore the atrocities of East Timor and elsewhere. The compensation ramifications of this bill, too, are so huge that the taxpayers of Australia should be very alarmed at the likely cost of extinguishment of not only the property but the cultural rights of indigenous Australians. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my question to the Prime Minister on 16 June I said that only in part 10 of his 10&hyphen;point plan was there a suggestion of a conciliatory mutual agreement avenue to establish native title. Only in this virtual add&hyphen;on to the bill is there room to facilitate agreement between parties outside the court and the tribunal structures, for in all other aspects the bill provides for widespread extinguishment, which will remove incentives for industry and government to come to any sort of consensual resolution of native title issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government could have shown the type of leadership required on this issue by drafting a bill based on recognition, acceptance and negotiation, it has instead opted for one based on denial, conflict and preferential treatment of the land interests of one group over another. But in so doing it has not delivered the sort of certainty it allegedly craves. It certainly delivered a certainty&mdash;the certainty of a lawyers' feast for years ahead as native claimants seek common law recognition of their title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must recount a conversation with a local Koori leader in my electorate in the last couple of days. He said to me, `It is a bit like the days of Poseidon when there were nouveau riche created in St Ives and suburbs of Sydney on the boom of the stock market back in the 1960s. The question then was, "Where did you make your money?" "I made it on Poseidon." There will be a heap of lawyers down the track in 20 years and they will gather and say, "Where did you make your money?" "I made it on native title."'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indigenous people have custodial responsibility for their own land and the general law applying to all Australians. As Rick Farley points out, the key to any resolution of native title claims is negotiation through processes that are flexible and regionally oriented. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) detailed the economic values of adopting this regional approach. Native title rights will vary from one area to another as indigenous customary law varies. This has been recognised in deliberations around the country where local negotiations are the most likely to achieve settlement. I sensed on a recent trip to north&hyphen;western Australia a preference for local 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9470"> negotiation and settlement rather than imposed advice from `suits from the south'. In closer settled areas, like that of Calare where the relocated or separated Kooris now live, there will obviously need to be a consensus among local elders. They are not fragmented to that degree&mdash;they are there; they still have influence and power despite the infiltration of the diseases and social ills that have served to even more fragment those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will need to be at least a recognition of the prior occupation by Aborigines of that now closely settled land&mdash;a tangible recognition&mdash;and a social justice package to compensate for the lack of opportunity, the deprivation of land and the forced relocation and disruption of families that that has caused to these people. As Farley says, any single white fella solution is a pipedream.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we debate this bill let us remember the words of Queensland pastoralist Ms Camilla Cowley which were quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> last week. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Months ago I was angry and confused when a native title claim was made over land which included my property. I immediately looked into what it meant and what could be done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the deeper I investigated the more I realised that the property that had been in my family for over two decades was not actually under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's too much confusion and misunderstanding around the whole debate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ms Cowley goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a landholder I am confident co&hyphen;existence is not only possible, it's the only decent way forward for the stakeholders and Nation as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I, like others, listened closely to the courageous words of the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), a government member, in this place and on this bill last night. Among many eloquent points he made from his well&hyphen;documented perspective as a champion of human rights, he stressed that this debate comes down to a legal versus moral judgment. The Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund will table its majority and minority reports to this parliament next week and they will canvass the legal and moral arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for New England (Mr Sinclair) says that we cannot look back, that we must 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> account for the fact that the traditional links between the Aborigine and the land have been fractured&mdash;so they may have in many cases&mdash;and it is only through the restoration of those links, not through freehold but through genuine coexisting native title, that we can restore the dignity of Aborigines. Only then, to use the words of the member for New England, can we `bring Aborigines into tomorrow's Australia'&mdash;although I would rather suggest that they would find their own way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One fact that we cannot deny as we debate the need for certainty of title is that 30,000, 40,000 or perhaps 120,000 years of native title is an absolute certainty. Terra nullius was, as Mabo decreed, a nonsense&mdash;225 years of very unequal coexistence puts that original title into some sort of perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does not provide for genuine coexistence. It is a gross overreaction which misses the point of just what native title is. Not only does it wrongly react to a feared land grab; it also provides for an air grab, for heaven's sake. Why? It dramatically sets back the reconciliation process, it risks enormous and justifiable scorn and for those reasons will not have my support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many of the earlier speakers would have made far more incisive and informed contributions in this debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill. I have not had the opportunity to focus on it and to play an active role in some of the committees within the various parties in the parliament that have dealt with it over a very long period. I do, however, want to make a few brief comments on some of the earlier contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As usual, the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) dished up the simplistic, easy, facile answers to these measures. Her contribution was rhetoric about `one people emerging as one nation', et cetera. In reality, if we look around the world we see that there is always the facility and the possibility of causing dissension and division without any of the characteristics of the multicultural in this country that she so despises and attacks. If, for instance, we look at Europe we find in Spain the nationalist cravings of Basques and Catalans; over the last five to 10 years we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9471"> have seen moves by northern Italy, under Mr Bossi leading a political party, that seek to divide Italy; in Scandinavia in recent weeks we have seen in the Norwegian elections a party which has had as one of its essential measures an attempt to decrease the rights of Laplanders&mdash;it has emerged as a very tangible and strong political force in Norway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the member for Oxley's rhetoric, despite the fact that this country has been populated by many peoples with many backgrounds, we still see throughout Europe&mdash;in cultures where the division lines and the dissension are not around the introduction of new races or around immigration&mdash;the distinct possibility that people who wish to use racial and ethnic differences may be able to exploit them politically. The member for Oxley's contribution to this debate is in line with those same politicians in Europe who seek to divide nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this country the situation is exacerbated by the deep uncertainty amongst people in the Australian electorate about their job security: uncertainty about the employment prospects for their children after they complete TAFE courses or high school and insecurity for themselves, when they are thrown onto the retrenchment scrap heap at 45 years of age, about whether they will ever be employed again. But native title is an issue the nation must face up to, and it should not be faced up to with contributions such as the characteristically divisive one made by the member for Oxley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the member for Oxley's recent statements about her intention to broaden her political base with a new emphasis in regard to the needs of ex&hyphen;servicemen, the defence forces, et cetera. Nevertheless, I would mention once again that, despite her newfound emphasis on this policy area, in regard to defence home loans last night, once again&mdash;for the third consecutive time&mdash;we found her unable to vote on a measure in this House. If that is her contribution in an area she wants to put a new emphasis on, I would hate to see the legislative role she might play on measures in those areas in which she has less interest. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one of his contributions the member for Moore (Mr Filing) expressed disdain for the intervention of British MPs. He referred to what the British had done centuries ago, suggesting they might have some debt because of the Tolpuddle Martyrs and questioning whether they have a contribution to make because of what happened in Van Diemen's Land. It came as a bit of a surprise to me that the member for Moore made that contribution: I seem to recall that, in regard to the internal affairs of the then Yugoslavian state, no&hyphen;one was as forthright and public as the member for Moore. I seem to recall that he rushed onto planes to be there, under shelling, during the initial outburst of disputes in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that stage no&hyphen;one asked the member for Moore whether,  given his country's previous practices against Aboriginals, he had a right to comment on the division of Yugoslavia or to make a point in regard to Croatia's future. He is just making a hypocritical contribution, in order to undermine a number of people from all political parties in the United Kingdom who question this attempt to undermine Aboriginal rights in Australia. The member for Moore is a man who has taken a very noteworthy and strong role in human rights around the world&mdash;in Timor and in a number of other countries. It is a bit cynical or a bit hypocritical of him today to be somehow disdainful and to find something wrong with politicians from another country commenting on our internal affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us have a degree of survival instinct, but I was a bit disillusioned by the member for Moore's reference, again, to the fact that Aboriginals constitute only two per cent of Australia's population and currently hold, by various means, an area, as he said, `greater than New South Wales, Victoria, the ACT and Tasmania combined', and by his claim that they might, according to the ACF, control 90 per cent of national parks in this country in future generations or years. He well knows that the value of the vast majority of this land is insignificant compared to the actual value of this country. To start saying that commercially useless tracts of land in the middle of nowhere should be put on a comparative basis 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9472"> with Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane is absolutely ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition comes to this debate determined to try to ensure that a degree of certainty does come to this area. It is not here to obstruct the interests of pastoralists just for the sake of it. It is here to make sure that we do have legislation which will get judicial approval. What this poll&hyphen;driven government is doing, essentially, is kowtowing to what they perceive as the instincts of the Australian electorate. Although I must concede that significant numbers of the members of this House do, because of the nature of the areas they represent, have a fundamental and very deep concern with the interests of landowners or of pastoralists, their interest is not fundamentally with those matters. We have this Native Title Bill here today because this country's Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, time after time, that his interest and his policies are driven by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> and a few radio commentators. That is why we are here today, not because of any real concern with pastoralists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's alternative, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) announced on 25 September, is based around certain fundamental principles. Those principles include the principle that the legislation should balance and reconcile, to the maximum possible extent, the interests and reasonable expectations of both indigenous Australians and other major stakeholders; the principle that there be the maximum possible predictability and certainty about the status of the act and its practical operation; the principle that it should further guarantee the constitutional validity of the legislation; and the principle that the processes established by the legislation to deal with the registration and determination of claims and the reconciliation of competing interests be as effective and expeditious as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's amendment goes on to say, essentially, that Labor has concerns that the reach of the validation provisions in the bill are beyond those necessary for the practical redress of post&hyphen;Wik problems&mdash;that there is manifestly unacceptable overreach in regard to the provisions purporting to confirm the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extinguishment of native title. Labor comes to this debate determined to get a measure of consensus and to try to get measures which will, as I said earlier, get through the court systems of this country. That should be the fundamental desire of all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The genesis of this process was Mabo No. 2 in 1993, which repudiated the doctrine of terra nullius. It is all right for the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, (Mr Tim Fischer) to carry on every second day of the week about whether that judgment was carried by a majority of one, two or three. The fact of life is that the High Court of this country made a determination. The Deputy Prime Minister talks about the legitimacy of particular decisions, as if any rational person would question the doctrine of terra nullius more than the size of the majority in regard to this measure. To assume in 1997 that the basis for decades and centuries of ignoring of Aboriginal indigenous rights in this country&mdash;the basis being that there was no established society here and, therefore, the white colonialists had a right to push people off their land and turn it over to another people&mdash;was neither intelligent nor rational is more intelligent and rational than discussing whether or not in 1993 the decision to make that assumption was agreed to by a majority of only one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go through the court decisions of this country over the last century, we find that similar quibbling and whingeing could have occurred over a variety of fairly crucial cases. The fact is that the court decided in that manner, and to try to discredit that decision on the basis of how many were for or against is absolutely preposterous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process then went to the then government's legislation, and no&hyphen;one on this side of politics has disputed that there is a need for remedial action. There is a need for improvement in regard to its operation. But what we are going to see here, whether it is under section 51(xxvi), the race power, or whether it is under section 51(xxix), the external affairs power, is this legislation having difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation has no certainty. This legislation is going to be attacked in a legal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9473"> fashion because there is no benefit in it to the Aboriginal people. It is essentially a taking away of rights and an undermining of their condition. If it is based on the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, it certainly discriminates against a racial group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is an attempt to undermine the legislation of the previous government, which set up an Indigenous Land Fund, an Indigenous Land Corporation and a social justice package to try to do something about the disadvantages of Aboriginals in this country. It involved something that is not present here today and that has certainly not been a facet of what has happened in the government's process to get here today, that is, a degree of goodwill and trust on both sides of this contentious issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aboriginal leadership in this country has had far greater difficulties than either of the major political parties in regard to this measure. It has had to go out into a community that tends to operate on consensus and show a degree of leadership and a willingness to compromise and to give up rights in regard to the validation of acts that it would regret and dispute. It has had to sell these propositions to a diverse community ranging through a very different set of living and housing patterns around this country&mdash;people dispersed from their lands and not connected to where they come from. It has had to go out and sell this kind of negotiating process. It has had to go out there and basically repudiate a lot of the political demands it has been making over many decades. So it has been a very difficult process for the Aboriginal leadership of this country to even get up to the Labor government's proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen since the election of the new government is an attempt to ignore, isolate and ridicule the leadership of the Aboriginal community. They have joined with the opposition in very grave concerns about where the government is going in this legislation. On 24 September this year, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission  made a number of points of concern about where the government eventually arrived. It 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> saw the legislation which the government proposes as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The extensive extinguishment of native title contained in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The attack on the right to negotiate contained in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The problem of only those native title holders who currently have access being given interim statutory access rights under this Bill, and thus potentially denying this opportunity to a whole generation of Aboriginal people who were denied access in the past through no fault of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Serious doubts that exist over significant parts of these amendments in terms of conflict with the Racial Discrimination Act and their potential to be invalid on constitutional grounds.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Previous speakers have gone through what they see as a number of erosions of rights and a significant plethora of ways in which this legislation denies Aboriginals rights that were integral to the previous act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is convoluted and complex. We know that there have been cascades of additional memoranda and we know the size of this bill. It is, as stated by a large number of speakers, not aimed at reconciliation, not aimed at trying to ensure a balance and not aimed at any certainty to make sure that both mining and pastoral interests know where they are going. It is, as indicated on television in the last few weeks, politically driven. There is a hope that the degree of uncertainty and the lack of knowledge on the part of the broad electorate of the issues involved can be manipulated by maps of Australia being held up on national television by the Prime Minister of this country, with extremist projections of what Aboriginals will possibly receive. That is what is driving this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many speakers and many experts have indicated that there is no fundamental threat to the traditional farming practices of people involved and that the building of dams and roads will still be able to be undertaken without any real problems. However, it has been indicated&mdash;and I think it is quite reasonable&mdash;that, if people do want to undertake major structural changes to the farm as it has been for decades, there should be some oversight as to whether that is reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing here today is an attempt to undermine the Wik decision and to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9474"> erode Aboriginal rights. We should recognise what is happening in this country and we should understand that it is a continuing process internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people decry the condition of Aboriginals in this country: their health problems, their housing difficulties, their failure to gain tertiary education, their inability in many cases to finish secondary school and the fact that they are condemned to the worst labouring jobs in this country. They decry the fact that in previous decades their children were taken from them and, in many cases, told that their parents were deceased or not interested in them. The fact is that, still in 1997, families try to pretend that relatives of theirs are not Aboriginal because of the degree of embarrassment, the disdain and the discrimination against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a tenet necessarily associated with Aboriginality; it is an international phenomenon we are seeing today. If we look at South America we see right now, as we speak in this parliament, the removal of people in Amazonia as Brazil expands its economy, destroying forests and putting roads through for petrol. We have seen articles in recent weeks in Colombia of isolated communities that have had minimal contact previously with Western society forced off their land because of the desire by international petrol companies for profits. If we look at Canada we see the condition of the Inuits. We see the way in which the Canadian government has taken a more active role in trying to accomplish reconciliation. As the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) indicated, this was not a five&hyphen;minute process; it took 16 years of negotiations to create the state of Nunavut in northern Canada.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must, in 1997, face the reality of what has happened in this country: that it was expropriation by force, that it was supported by illegitimate legal pretension in regard to terra nullius and that these people were essentially put into a condition which we see today around the world. As I said, it is not novel; it is essentially part of what is happening in large parts of South and Central America, to which another speaker referred earlier. The Japanese government has, in recent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> months, woken up to the need to recognise the rights of the Ainu, their indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is a continuation of those racist processes. It is a failure to really move towards reconciliation. It is an attempt to exploit uncertainty and racism in this country. I commend the amendment to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is extremely sensitive to many Australians of all origins, from diverse backgrounds and of differing periods of presence in this land. I am here as a result of my father arriving here from Greece in 1916. Many other members of this parliament in years gone by have a similar background. Some of the animosity and abuse that is extended towards indigenous Australians today is similar to that extended towards my father and towards us as children. We coped with that; we had to cope with that. We are not black, so we did not stand out as indigenous Australians stand out, but that same behaviour of fear, of ignorance and of prejudice, and the generation of those prejudices and animosities between Australians, is what is being utilised by so many on the govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment side of this parliament today and by supporters of the government's side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of all, this legislation goes to the root and foundation of today's Australia and to the rights and interests of our indigenous people. Australia will be judged by the rest of the world on the manner in which we handle this legislation; on the manner in which we handle the rights, the interests, the culture and the beliefs of the original inhabitants of our land and their descendants. Australia will be judged on the fairness we extend to our indigenous peoples and their descendants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation before us today is not the result of some great statesmanlike process to set, as a model for the rest of the world, how we should accord and deal with the rights of our indigenous peoples and their descendants; it is the result of a political fix. It is the result of a brawl within the National Party over how to get some form of words before the parliament. Again despicable is the claim of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) that the language of the provisions of the bill leads one to believe there will be `bucketloads of extinguishment'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Deputy Prime Minister is really saying is, `Have no fear, we'll get rid of the rights of indigenous Australians; don't you worry about that.' I can almost hear old Sir Joh saying, `Don't you worry about that' when I see the Deputy Prime Minister saying `bucketloads of extinguishment'. The code language is, `Don't you worry about that, those of you who are concerned as land&hyphen;holders and supporters of the National Party; we'll fix the indigenous Australians because we intend that the meanings within the provisions of that bill will achieve the objectives you want.' That is not leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This country deserves something better from a Prime Minister and a Deputy Prime Minister on an issue like this. This bill has the potential to rip asunder the fragile fabric that is our national character, our Australia. It has the potential to set Australian against Australian for years to come. Once Australia has been ripped asunder, it will take decades to heal the divisions, the hurt and the sheer animosity that I see in and hear from those who cannot accept, cannot tolerate that in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9476"> digenous Australians do have rights and are entitled to equality of entitlements and opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Act 1993 is complex legislation because it deals with a complex range of issues that have remained unaddressed for so long. But the legislation, by the very nature of the problem, has to be complex if we are to find a solution. That complexity will be exacerbated by this bill, should it be passed in its existing form. Instead of bringing greater clarity, predictability and certainty to native title matters, it will massively increase the uncertainty surrounding them. It will set Australian against indigenous Australian for decades to come, and it will demean Australia in the eyes of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Act 1993 was arrived at through extensive consultation of the people it most affects&mdash;the indigenous people of our country, as well as farmers and miners. In arriving at this decision, all concerned had to compromise. But they should not be expected to give up more. The Native Title Act 1993 was 127 pages; and, despite all the government's complaints that it is an act which is far too complex and complicated, the Native Title Amendment Bill before us now runs for 293 pages, with an explanatory memorandum that runs for 385 pages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this complex national discussion of native title, Mabo and the Wik decision of the High Court, the most deplorable development has been the incredible efforts of the Queensland government and the Queensland Premier, Rob Borbidge, to misrepresent the implications of native title. What Rob Borbidge was really about was a different agenda altogether; with a hung parliament, he was about trying to create an issue for an election campaign in Queensland. It had nowt to do with the merits of the native title legislation. It had to do with setting black against white, Aborigine or indigenous Australian against non-indigenous Australian; to create an election issue to divide Queensland leading to an election. Fortunately, Mr Borbidge has failed. He did not get the election he wanted, and he will not get it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, it was a political fix for the National Party in country Australia involving fear, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exaggeration, and anti-Aboriginal campaigns that will only damage the fabric of the nation that these people purport to protect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Moore (Mr Filing), who spoke earlier, may not like the criticism of Australia from abroad. But I want to say to him also that the manner in which we treat our indigenous Australians is of interest to the rest of the world. They will comment upon us and our performance in a similar way to when we commented upon South Africa and its treatment of its native peoples during its period of apartheid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the discussion leading to the Native Title Act 1993, I said that everybody had to compromise&mdash;and we do not expect that people should have to give up more. But the emphasis in this bill appears to have changed from certainty for all those concerned to the security of pastoral leaseholders, never mind the indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party, the federal opposition, is interested in delivering justice to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and genuine certainty and predictability for all stakeholders, especially farmers and miners. Effectively, this bill is about the extinction of native title&mdash;as I referred earlier to the continued statements of the Deputy Prime Minister, `bucket loads of extinguishment' in that bragging fashion in which he puts it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1993 act accepted the concept of native title, and set out to address the attendant problems. It confirmed the validity of every previously issued title, and set down a process for the expeditious and cost effective handling of native title claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The negotiations that the government of the day went through were genuine. They were not simply a crude sales exercise for a predetermined government position. It was not legislation dressing up in clothes a decision that has already been taken which actually seeks to attain an objective different from that of the legislation that is now before us. The goal was to deliver certainty, clarity, workability and practicability from a position of respecting everyone's rights, and the conviction that certainty for any of the interest groups could only come from consensus.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9477">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time, the now government, as the then opposition, showed no respect for the existence of native title; this legislation and their behaviour since and as a government exhibit that same attitude still. In the end, indigenous people were given the right to negotiate. But what this government is about now is taking away the right to negotiate in any meaningful form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The courts were yet to rule on critical issues, such as the continued existence of native title on pastoral leases; and, in 1993, the decision was to leave that to the courts to decide. The High Court has now decided that it was obvious that the act would need to be amended at a relatively early stage. With cases already being in the court, such amendments would have to ensure that existing cases were not compromised and would have to constitute a measured response rather than an overreaction to sectional pressures&mdash;and, particularly, sectional party political pressures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition went to the polls in 1996 as enthusiastic converts to the concept of native title. They said, in effect, `Elect us, trust us, and we will not change a thing.' The Wik proposition is that native title might, in theory, persist on some pastoral leases but that any such title was emphatically extinguished or suppressed to the extent that it was in any way inconsistent with a pastoralist's enjoying of his or her title. Wik confirmed the pastoralists' title&mdash;yet, with the hysteria that followed the decision, one would, in the general community, come to think the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a gross overreaction to the Wik decision on behalf of the government, an overreaction that ignores the rights of indigenous Australians. It asks that massive schedules provided by state governments of purportedly exclusive possession acts should be incorporated in this bill without a shred of corroborating evidence that this is indeed the case. It winds back the right to negotiate that Aboriginals gained as part of the 1993 package. It winds it back to such an extent that it may as well not exist at all. This amendment is effectively about the mass extinguishment of native title. As I said, the Deputy Prime 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister bragged about bucketloads of extinguishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment, far from being about certainty, is a recipe for uncertainty for pastoralists, uncertainty for miners and uncertainty for indigenous interests. The amendment massively increases the complexity and volume of work for court and tribunal registrars, but it is silent on the resources for doing the job&mdash;again, a recipe for bottlenecks and delays. The amendment ignores the Racial Discrimination Act and invites legal challenge under the constitution. The bill must be improved to offer greater certainty, real workability and real equity for all stakeholders. Such certainty was washed away when this government came to power. From that moment they have walked away from the agreement and the compromise that was reached between indigenous Australians, the government of the day, miners and farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1993 act was implemented with certain core principles: ungrudging and unambiguous recognition and protection of native title; provision for clear and certain validation of past acts, including grants and laws, if they have been invalidated because of the existence of native title; a just and practical regime governing future grants and acts affecting native title; and rigorous, specialised and accessible tribunal and court processes for determining claims to native title and for negotiation and decisions on proposed grants over native title land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's current proposals in this legislation change each and every one of these core principles to the detriment of indigenous Australians. The previous agreement meant sacrifice on the part of all of the parties that participated in those discussions that led up to the framing and passage of the legislation of 1993. The previous agreement meant sacrifice but it was an agreement which respected the rights of pastoralists, miners, indigenous Australians and others with an interest in the land. It is clear from the legislation that the government has no such respect for that legislation or for those rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night I was greatly impressed to hear the words of the member for Aston (Mr Nugent). I understand that as a member of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9478"> government it is extremely difficult for him to put the views that he put, but he will go down in the history of this parliament as a man of great principle, a man who, given his background in Aboriginal affairs as shadow minister and his service in this parliament, had a greater ambit of understanding of all Australians, but particularly indigenous Australians, than other members of the government. I would like to quote him in reference to Australia. I quote from page 9343 where he is talking about multiculturalism:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By any standards, Australia has been one of the most cohesive, peaceful and harmonious nations on earth. Multiculturalism has enriched the state.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to endorse those remarks. Multiculturalism means we are a nation drawn from many different cultures&mdash;more than 160 different cultures drawn from more than 100 nations. We are a model for the rest of the world, or we have been until just recently, and we want to resume that role of being a model of how those peoples drawn from those nations, of so many different cultures, have welded a stronger sense of independence, of freedom, of compassion, of tolerance, of understanding and of recognising the rights of other Australians, all those races and groups that go to make up this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude with some other words of his. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to note that native title is a form of title within the nation state, as is freehold or leasehold title. And yet native title is a very different form of title from the usual understanding of property ownership inherent in freehold or even leasehold. It must coexist with leasehold and, where there is a conflict, the rights of the leaseholder prevail. Native title holders are in no sense the sole property owners of the land over which they have been granted title. They must share it with the Crown or with the leaseholder, having only traditional rights and limited negotiation rights over what happens on that land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I commend his words to the parliament. I strongly endorse what he said on those matters I have quoted, and I commend him as a member of this parliament for the contribution he has made to this issue, the most important issue this parliament has seen for many decades. And I commend the amendments that have been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to the parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all the many members of the House who have participated in this lengthy debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . Native title is a difficult issue for Australia. It is complex, it evokes passion and it is novel. It is clearly an issue which will require long&hyphen;term consideration by this parliament and the nation as its characteristics become more apparent. This bill is another step in the process. The government believes the bill is a balanced and practical response to the challenging issues which have emerged since the Native Title Act was passed at the end of 1993. Certainly it goes much further along the way towards certainty than the current act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summing up, I want to focus on a number of issues where, judging from the comments of some speakers, clarification is necessary about what the amendments actually do so that further debate is better informed. Few opponents of the bill appear to understand, or are willing to concede, that there are substantial deficiencies in the act which must be remedied if the coexistence of native title with other interests is to be accommodated in our legal system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> By way of example, the current act could mean that holders of pastoral leases where native title may coexist may not be able to continue activities that are legal under the terms of their leases and essential to their businesses or to diversify their activities without extinguishing native title. This is because the conventional wisdom in 1993 was that native title would be found to exist in some fairly limited and remote parts of Australia and it would not be interacting with other interests. As a consequence, the act was not designed to deal with coexisting rights and interests. We now know that this perceived wisdom is false. The act needs to be changed to put in place a more appropriate future act regime, in particular for pastoral lease land. The bill does this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> A constant refrain from the opposition is that the bill lacks a proper constitutional foundation. The government has obtained formal constitutional advice from the Solicitor-General to the effect that the bill is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9479"> entirely supported as a special law under the races power of the constitution. Nevertheless, the government recognises that the constitutional validity of the bill is likely to be challenged, just as the Native Title Act itself was challenged, on the basis that the races power does not support detrimental laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The view of the government is that the bill is not detrimental, but even if it were it would, on existing authority, be supported by the races power. Assertions about constitutional validity should not prevent passage of the bill any more than they prevented passage of the Native Title Act in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It has been alleged by some that the bill overrides or overturns the decisions of the High Court in Mabo No. 2 and Wik. The government rejects these suggestions. On the contrary, the act, as amended by the bill, will recognise and protect native title in Australia, including coexisting native title on pastoral lease land. The bill allows native title to continue to exist on pastoral lease land and land subject to other lessor interests and mining leases and for it to be claimed over such land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The bill adopts the very test in Wik that native title has been extinguished to the extent that the grant of rights and interests to lessees are inconsistent with native title rights and interests, but the bill leaves it to the courts to assess the level of this inconsistency. The bill provides&mdash;again as the court held in Wik&mdash;that the lessees' rights prevail. It implements this principle in the practical real world of primary production activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is argued by some that the validation provisions are not justified because governments wilfully ignored the possibility that native title existed on pastoral leases. The acts to be validated were done on the assumption that governments were free to do various acts over pastoral lease and other leasehold land without following the processes of the Native Title Act. This was an assumption supported by the decision of the High Court in Mabo No. 2, by many statements of the former government, by the Native Title Act itself, by the practice of the National Native Title Tribunal and by decisions of the Federal Court. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that the assumption that pastoral leases had extinguished native title was one which legitimately could have been held and one which was encouraged by the previous government. The government believes that grants made on the basis of this assumption should be validated by legislation. It is not possible to provide the necessary validity through agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The confirmation provisions are vital to ensuring certainty in areas of Australia where, on any reasonable assessment, native title has been extinguished. The act currently leaves these issues to be determined by the common law. The bill will allow confirmation of the extinguishment of native title in line with Mabo No. 2 and Wik. The government has released schedule 4 of the bill which, as previously foreshadowed, I will be seeking to move as a government amendment to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The schedule includes types of agricultural, residential, commercial and community purpose leases which the Commonwealth and the relevant state or territory believe with reasonable certainty have conferred exclusive possession and have therefore extinguished native title. The schedule does not contain any pastoral leases or other lessor interests, and mining leases are specifically excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary joint committee has heard evidence from the states that the Commonwealth has taken a particularly conservative approach to the inclusion of tenures in the schedule. The argument has been made that this approach pre&hyphen;empts the common law. But to leave these issues to be determined on a case by case basis by the courts would create an enormous cost and leave enormous uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> From the government's point of view, such a massive expenditure for no, or very little, tangible benefit to Aboriginal peoples cannot be justified. Expenditure should be directed to determining where native title exists and protecting the rights of the holders, not to confirming on a case by case basis where it has been extinguished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The operation of the proposed amendments relating to primary production have been widely misunderstood. That was evident from some of the contributions to the debate by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9480"> members of the opposition. The fact is that the current act contains very limited mechanisms for managing future acts on pastoral leases. The bill makes explicit for the first time: that pastoralists are able to carry on primary production activities on the pastoral lease and that those activities prevail; state and territory governments are able to continue to authorise primary production activities; state and territory governments are able to continue to authorise pastoralists who carry on activities outside the farm area which are directly related to the primary production activities on the lease; and State and territory governments can continue to authorise the taking of natural resources from pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These acts will be subject to the non-extinguishment principle. These provisions in the bill do not confer on the pastoralist or any other person any additional rights to do the activities in question and say nothing about the validity or lawfulness of pastoralists' activities under state or territory law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The management of pastoral leases remains a matter for the relevant state or territory government, as it always has been. The same applies in relation to environmental controls. It is wholly inappropriate that it should be suggested that native title legislation should now be used as an instrument of environmental regulation. Moreover, contrary to some of the grossly inaccurate reporting over the past six months, it is not the case that the amendments will result in a windfall for foreign pastoral leaseholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to future development on pastoral leases, the policy of the government is to ensure that future legitimate land management needs for native title and non-native title land, such as suburban developments, public infrastructure and agricultural developments, can be accommodated. It is hoped that this can be by way of agreement with native title holders  and others, and the agreement provisions in the bill facilitate this. There may, however, be occasions when agreements cannot be reached. The protections in the current act against non-consensual extinguishment of native title on pastoral lease land or elsewhere are maintained and, indeed, strengthened. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They will ensure that the only way native title can be extinguished in the future is by agreement or by way of non-discriminatory compulsory acquisition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contradictory views have been expressed about the efficacy of the right to negotiate provisions. The facts are these: in Western Australia, of the 1,910 acts which have been subject to the full right to negotiate process, only 148 have been cleared for grant as at 10 October 1997, a clearance rate of about 7.7 per cent. The greater than 90 per cent clearance rate often quoted is for exploration licences which have not gone through the right to negotiate processes and for which there is no protection under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is argued, however, that it is essential to retain the right to negotiate on both exploration and mining in order to protect native title. The fact is that the alternatives in the bill for this double right to negotiate provide for the first time appropriate protection through conjunctive agreements and through a regime which requires consultation on access and site protection and recognises the need to establish contact between the miners and indigenous peoples at an early stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as ministerial intervention in the right to negotiate process is concerned, the power is constrained by strict criteria. The minister cannot intervene in the right to negotiate processes at will. There has been some criticism of the proposal to allow the states and territories to apply their own regime on coexisting tenures in place of the right to negotiate. These are areas where, if native title exists, the native title holders do not enjoy a right to exclude others and have, at best, only coexisting rights. In the government's view, it is inappropriate to equate native title rights in these areas to full ownership rights. The government's position is that the states and territories should be able to replace the right to negotiate provided that significant procedural protections for native title holders are provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is widespread support for the enhanced agreements process in the bill. Most interest groups recognise the potential for such agreements to provide lasting and work 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9481"> able resolution to native title land use and coexistent issues at a local or regional level either with or without government participation. Together with the enhanced representative body scheme and the increased availability of funding to develop local or regional agreements, the new agreement provisions provide an attractive alternative to the more formal and adversarial processes for resolving native title related issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is general agreement that the Native Title Act needs to have an effective registration test which can ensure that only claims with merit are registered and bring an end to the problem of overlapping and multiple claims. The changes to the legal aid scheme recognise the importance of agreements in resolving native title issues. They also recognise that native title is a new area of the law confronting a variety of interest holders in the land. Amendments to section 183 deliver greater parity of access to government assistance for respondent parties in native title matters by replacing the hardship test with a reasonableness test to widen the range of persons who can receive such assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allegations have been made that the government failed to consult on the bill and, in particular, to negotiate on its contents with indigenous groups. It is true that the government did not make the same mistake as the former government and negotiate with particular groups to the exclusion of others with legitimate interests in the outcome. What the government did do was to follow an open and consultative process, from its initial development of the 10-point plan, the development of the working draft bill and the bill's subsequent refinement for introduction into the parliament to the development of the schedule of exclusive tenures attached to the bill. It has had significant discussions with indigenous representatives and the bill includes proposals put forward by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has continued this approach before the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. The Special Minister of State (Senator Minchin) is on the record as saying that serious consideration 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be given to any proposals, consistent with the 10-point plan, which improve the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been too much exaggeration and posturing by some about this issue and too few people have done the hard work to look at it carefully. The government continues to believe that the bill is a fair balance. It substantially implements the Wik decision. It does not involve the wholesale extinguishment of native title on pastoral lease land. It meets many of the concerns of indigenous groups. Of course, like all advocates for a cause, some indigenous leaders would like much more, but the government and the parliament are obliged to balance the aspirations of indigenous peoples with sensible and workable solutions which meet those needs and aspirations in concert with the needs and aspirations of the whole community of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government welcomes the views of others about the bill. But critics and commentators have a responsibility to be properly informed and to take into account all interests, not just promote one group. They also need to provide practical, workable solutions. The government's bill is a practical, workable, balanced move forward.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R324">Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill 1997</XREF>  is the first of a number of stages of legislation that the government will be introducing in the coming months to give effect to the rural package that was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) some months ago. I signal at the outset of this debate that the opposition is very happy to give passage to this legislation. We are supportive of measures to provide assistance to farm households during difficult circumstances, as we have always been, and that is a point I want to develop in this discussion. There are some improvements to the existing situation which we support and which we see as a natural progression of this kind of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I want to start my comments by perhaps substantiating a response that I made when this package was first announced, because those on the other side took some umbrage, which was particularly apparent in some of the public comments made by the minister, to my statement that this package represented little short of a rural hoax. What I meant by that was that, for a number of years whilst they were in opposition, some members of the current government, including 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9484"> the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), the Prime Minister and a number of members involved in the government's rural representation, spent almost every waking moment wandering around rural Australia talking about the Labor Party's complete disregard, lack of concern, lack of interest and lack of support for, particularly, farmers who were in difficulty. They said it so often that they came to believe it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they came to government and they brought down their first budget, instead of having a new `integrated rural support package', which was being proposed, there was simply a refunding of former Labor government programs but with the statement that this would all be pulled together into the new whizzbang integrated rural package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, for the 15 months between their election to government and the bringing down of this package, we continued to get more of the same. I refer, for instance, to comments made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in this place on 29 October last year, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After 13 years of inactivity, the Labor Party have put the industry at risk . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said, further, on 7 November 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. Why is the Labor Party against that? They were responsible for a lot of this damage in the first place. It reflects the fact that total farm debt as a result of 13 years of your mismanagement . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And so on. It became part of the culture of members of the then opposition, and they continued it when they came into government, to routinely go out into rural Australia and bag the ALP's policies to assist and support farm households and propose at all times that they would be coming up with a new integrated package that would be the solution to all these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we got? We have got the first tranche of legislation. These particular components include the farm family restart scheme. Do you know what that is? It is a $45,000 lump sum that assists those farmers who may feel that the time and economic circumstances are such that they should move off the farm and go and do something else. It is a $45,000 lump sum accompanied by access to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> newstart allowance, or the unemployment benefit. It is wage assistance accompanied by some retraining packages. And, guess what? It is a fabulous new package! What was Labor's package? It was a $45,000 lump sum package called `re&hyphen;establishment'; theirs is called `farm family restart', for God's sake. This is what I am talking about as being a rural hoax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As this legislation comes in, piece by piece and component by component, I am going to show the House and everybody out there who is listening how just about every single piece of this package is simply Labor's former program which has been repackaged, rebadged and claimed as some great innovation for rural Australia, and sold and marketed by a Prime Minister who has made the same claim. There are some minor changes and, as I said, of course there will be. Of course, during our 13 years, we came through the evolution of these programs to finetune them and change them and develop them. So, too, that will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not have the slightest complaint if anyone on the other side of the House had been straight enough or decent enough to stand up and say, `The household support packages that Labor had in place are the way to deal with the problems, and the government intends to continue those but to finetune and improve them.' If that is what they had had the decency to say, I would not have a single reason to stand here and complain at this dispatch box. But we are unfolding here the evidence of the hoax, because they have actually gone out and tried to tell people in rural Australia that this is some brand new $500 million package. The day after the package was launched, all the farm organisations lauded it&mdash;even the National Farmers Federation. Everybody lauded it. The only person in Australia saying, `Hey, I wonder if this is so spectacular,' was me. Twenty&hyphen;four hours after the euphoria, even the National Farmers Federation came out conceding that, of the $517 million involved in the budget, at most $30 million was new money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are actually getting is a very significant vote of confidence by the government in Labor's former farm household 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9485"> support programs. And that is the point I want to make: if they had the decency to say that, I would not have a complaint, but if they continue to go around and try to market themselves as the experts who have suddenly arrived with a brand new package for the farm sector, then this is the response in every bit of its detail that we will get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the specific components here, yes, we see the farm family restart lump sum of $45,000 as an amount that can be continued with. We note that the assets test limits which had applied under the previous government have actually been increased from $45,000 I think it is to $90,000 under this provision. As Labor's spokesman on primary industry issues, I am very happy with that. I have presented that to our shadow ministry and we have all agreed that we support this measure to make it easier for farm families to access this restart benefit. We note that, if a family under this legislation chooses not to leave straightaway but to try to work it through for a year or so while they try to sell the property, they do have immediate access to the newstart income support package. Again, there is nothing new in that; that is exactly the way it was and we agree with that. We are happy to support it. I note that if families do draw on some newstart support&mdash;for example, if it were $200 a week for a year, that would be about $10,000&mdash;that amount of $10,000 would come off the $45,000 lump sum at the end. Again, there is nothing very new in that. It is a measure that we are happy to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an easing of the requirement to demonstrate that the farm is no longer viable for the particular family involved. Under our previous measures it was actually a requirement that the farm be put on the market. Under this provision it is no longer necessary for the farm to be actually placed on the market, but there are some specific measures in there that mean that the farm owners need to go into a business support program and they need to actually be given an assessment that does demonstrate that the farm is not viable in order to qualify for the lump sum, and it will in fact lead to the farm being placed on the market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are quite relaxed about the relaxing of that provision. But nobody on the government side should try to purport to anyone in the rural sector that applying for this farm family restart lump sum does not mean that their farm is not going on the market and does not mean that they are not really being expected to move themselves off. So, basically, there is no change except for some minor liberalisation of the assets test which we are happy enough to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also contains a provision to change the drought relief payment scheme so that it more broadly encompasses the exceptional circumstances relief payment. Again, from our point of view, we are completely relaxed with that. I have said on a number of occasions, when we were looking specifically at the situation of Gippsland dairy farmers where it was next to impossible to demonstrate that a climate event was a drought in terms of the normal criteria that are applied by the federal and state governments when they are assessing these things yet it was very clear to everybody that this was quite possibly an 80&hyphen; to 100&hyphen;year climate event that nobody could have been reasonably expected to plan for, that we need to rethink the shape of some of these guidelines. Of course, this bill does that with the embracing of the term `exceptional circumstances'. And, again, we are very relaxed about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again return to the point that, as these measures come through, there will be some measures in the rural package that we will have some serious questions about, and more of these points will be made. But we are quite relaxed about the components of the Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill  which we are dealing with today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me emphasise, on the part of all members of this House, the reasons why there is, in fact, bipartisan support for the need for farm household support programs of this kind. We are all aware&mdash;and we, from our experience in government, were well aware&mdash;that there are many families, as producers in the rural sector, who are receiving income from their production which, in many cases, is either at a loss or is so close to the cost of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9486"> production and the cost of ownership of the business that they make very little profits as far as the tax office statistics go. I think the last figures I saw were that 67 per cent of Australia's farming enterprises either make no profit or are producing a negative return at the tax office. That tells you that many of these families are living in very tight circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that when we were deliberating, particularly about the situation of Gippsland dairy farmers, it raised a whole social question&mdash;not that I am fixated on Gippsland in any way in this sense; there have been a number of climate events that have taken place on the east coast of Australia where the circumstances are very similar. But what we are looking at here is a concentration of something like 2,500 to 3,000 dairy farm families. By any economic rationalist, sensible, hard criteria, you would look at that and say, `Well, for at least the bottom 20 per cent&mdash;the 20 per cent who are making a loss and do not have the capital to survive&mdash;the best thing they could do is apply for the farm family restart $45,000 lump sum and move off their farms.' But that creates a little problem. If 20 per cent of 2,500 to 3,000 families move off their farms&mdash;we are talking about 500 to 600 families vacating their properties or businesses&mdash;then what do we do? Do they become part of the unemployment statistics in other towns in the region? Do we watch them move to Melbourne and become part of the housing problem in Melbourne? Do we care if the rural communities that they are part of suddenly lose a teacher, a policeman or some nursing home beds because the population is diminished because these people have moved out?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are immensely serious social questions to be answered in Australia at the moment. The decline in jobs and profitability in the rural sector is not only leading to the issue of farm families facing these difficulties but also leading to much broader flow&hyphen;ons in our whole social planning. That takes us to the question of what a government can do, and, by definition, it has to have these sorts of programs in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say, as Labor's spokesman for primary industry, that there are a number of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> measures in this support package which treat farm families differently to other families in Australia. I do not have any objection to that. In fact, what I am saying to the government is: if you have seen the light for farm families in difficulty, then let us put that in place and let us ask you to then have a look at a number of other families. But it is certainly not sustainable&mdash;and I hope every member of the government understands this&mdash;for farmers and farm families as businesses to be given special treatment which does not flow on in policy development to other parts of Australian society, because that case cannot be mounted. Not even I would try to mount it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within my own party I argue that this is the way the government has chosen to deal with this particular sector. I support these measures and the view that improvements made in the social treatment of farm families should apply equally to ordinary workers' families or small business wherever they might be. I do not know whether the government have thought through not only the policy issues that develop, for instance, from the special tax treatment that is built into this package but also the gifting provisions&mdash;which will come up in some other topics we will be dealing with&mdash;which will enable older farm families to pass on the farm and the house to the younger. If they have not thought about these things, they ought to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw people's attention to an article published in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> under the heading `Farm families miss out on aid payments'. We have been aware of this for a long time. A government with the best of intentions&mdash;obviously, the Labor government must have had the best of intentions because, despite all the rhetoric, the government has picked up our former programs and put them back again or maintained them&mdash;has provided these packages for many years. The evidence is showing us that about a third of farm families that would be eligible for family support payments have not applied. We know that there is a psychological question there. They are hugely independent, self&hyphen;determined people who do not want to apply for welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farm organisations have to do more to get their people to understand that running around 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9487"> bagging dole bludgers&mdash;as they have so often been encouraged to do by their political leadership over the years&mdash;creates a mentality where, when you are in a desperate situation yourself, you do not want to apply for support because someone will call you a dole bludger, possibly even your neighbour. You have to think through a few of these things. It is all right to go on with the political rhetoric, but we have a serious problem in the farm sector. We have created a culture where the men, in particular, refuse to accept the support that is available to them or they are not well informed about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am saying to the government that, just as we had to put a lot of effort into trying to break this cycle by making sure that they at least understood that support was available, so, too, behind the package that is involved in this legislation and its improvements, effort should be put in to making sure that farm families not only understand it but are encouraged to apply for it. I repeat very strongly: change the rhetoric of attacking waterside workers or whoever it might be who is popularly blamed in the country for your problems; certainly change the rhetoric of blaming the welfare sector for the nation's budget ills, whatever they may be. In many cases, that rhetoric creates its own psychology that creates this very problem. We have a responsibility, as national politicians, to put these support programs in and to encourage our people to qualify and use them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another aspect of this that is not specifically covered in the legislation today, and we will see how it unfolds with the rest of the package as the legislation comes forward. A continuing problem, particularly in this area of income support benefits, is that farmers are self&hyphen;employed business people in their own right. They are not like somebody who is perhaps retrenched, loses their job or does not have and is applying for a job. In many cases, they are surviving on minimal income but still trying to work their property. So an unemployment benefit is not the appropriate term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We wrestled for many years to try to find ways to open up what people generally know as an unemployment benefit and actually pay 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it as income support to a family that is working hard but not making enough money to live&mdash;and it does not just apply to farms. There are many small and micro businesses in the same situation, and this is the point I am flagging. As the government wrestles with ways to find that cross&hyphen;dialogue between social security provisions and farm household support, it is not only necessary to have the pathway but also necessary to have a simple system of application so that people are not turned away by the bureaucracy, the red tape and sheer intimidation of going in when you do not really fit the box. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have advocated on these things many times in our own caucus. I think it is incumbent on the government to be working more on these guidelines so that those cross pathways work easily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not have an activity test, which is what it is called. A person who is not a farmer or a business person applying for unemployment benefits has to actually satisfy what they call an activity test&mdash;they have to demonstrate that they are looking for work. Under our program, this activity test was waived for the farm household support provisions. I note that the government has also maintained that waiver in this legislation, and I welcome that. But I make the point that there are still many farm families out there who have not actually applied for these benefits because they still think that some of those guidelines apply to them or that it is all too hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, part of this $517 million hoax is to provide estimates in the budget for how much you think is actually going to be spent and used up without appreciating that it is so difficult to apply for or, for many people, so difficult to understand that they do not even apply. We have not seen the estimates yet. It is going to be very interesting to see what the take&hyphen;up rates of some of the components of this package are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In this particular case, we very much agree that this legislation needed to be maintained. I am aware that, in the transition from the former household support scheme to what is now the farm family restart scheme, there has been a decision taken to waive the outstand 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9488"> ing obligation of people who had previously taken it as a loan. That means that, under the former provisions, people actually took it as a loan to help them through a period and then repaid it. In many cases there were no repayments, and they were waived. Under this legislation, in winding up the old program, the government is waiving $5 million of outstanding debt from the old program. I actually count that as genuine new expenditure. I am very happy to acknowledge that as genuine new expenditure, and I welcome it. The new payments that will now be made under this program are not in the form of a loan; they are in the form of a grant, which, effectively, is how it finished up anyway. It is a piece of finetuning that we are quite happy to move with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government could have had the decency&mdash;and that is the term I use&mdash;to say to rural Australia, `Look, Labor had a raft of programs in place. They were all too complex, not enough people applied for them and there really should have been more money allocated to them. But the basic framework was okay and what we will be doing is trying to improve it.' Had they had the decency to go out and market it as that, I would not have a complaint here at the box. I would simply be saying, `This is a non&hyphen;controversial piece of legislation. We support it. Let's put it through.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, they went out and deceived people into thinking that, first of all, Labor had made such a mess of the whole range of low income farm family support programs that they were going to get rid of it all and replace it with some new whizzbang integrated rural package. That is all we heard for the first 15 months of the new government: `Wait till you see our new package.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well, we have seen it, and what is it? It is a re&hyphen;presentation&mdash;and piece by piece I am going to show this&mdash;of Labor's former programs. In some cases the programs have not changed even one bit, but in this case it has been changed by what I would call some marginal finetuning, that we all agree with, that is a logical consequence. It certainly ain't a grand new piece of vision for rural Australia. As I said before, the claim about $517 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million in new farm support is what I call very close to a hoax, because even the National Farmers Federation came out within 24 hours of sitting down and actually studying it and agreed with me that the most they could find was $30 million of new money. I am calling on those opposite to have some decency in the way they go about presenting this package that has been brought together. There is very little evidence of their having streamlined anything much at all. The particular programs are all still in their individual boxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the circumstances which led to yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> article about farm families missing out on support payments for all the reasons, which we understand, that are outlined in it, as far as I can see there will be very little change in that situation unless members of the government change their rhetoric and put some real effort into genuinely explaining the role of support payments, or what they call `welfare'. They must genuinely explain to the farm sector and to others in small business that the purpose of this is to assist people who are in work but who are on minimal incomes and struggling to survive. With those comments, I indicate that those on this side of the House are happy to give passage to this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to rise in the House to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R324">Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill 1997</XREF>  and to hear the shadow minister, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), generally support in a bipartisan way the thrust of the government's endeavours on behalf of rural and regional Australia, particularly farm families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation, which is part of the government's integrated rural policy, Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia, will help to build a competitive, sustainable and profitable rural sector. The measures introduced in the bill will ensure farm families experiencing financial hardship will have equitable, reasonable and fair access to welfare support. The rural sector accounts for a major share of Australia's exports and provides the basis for much of the nation's value adding in the fibre processing industries. The legislation before 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9489"> the House today will actually make a difference in local and regional communities across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister mentioned finetuning the former Labor policies. I would like to debunk some of the issues that he raised before I conclude today, but first I will move on to the facts of the matter. The rural sector in Australia has faced unprecedented challenges. Consider these important remarks from the minister's second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the top 20 per cent of farm businesses are performing well&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">as are most businesses in Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">data collected by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics show the sector, as a whole, has endured a long period of negative profitability. Severe drought, low commodity prices and cost pressures, particularly in the farm finance market, have created a very difficult operating environment for farm businesses.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When you come from an electorate like McMillan in eastern Victoria, you know your community has experienced rural decline. But that is not confined to my community, or to yours in Tasmania, Mr Deputy Speaker; it extends to the whole of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested when the shadow minister remarked that this package was important. In Gippsland's situation, which I will expand on, you have 3,500 farmers particularly affected by a one in a hundred years experience that we called a drought. But it was not really a drought, it was a green drought. We could not establish ourselves as being in exceptional circumstances compared with the rest of Australia. I might add that we did not get a lot of sympathy from the rest of the farm community around Australia for the difficulties that we had with a one in a hundred years situation of too much rainfall, on the one hand, and lack of rainfall, on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had to argue over a three&hyphen;year period that we had a drought situation on our hands. It was a complicated arrangement, and it was hard to explain to the general public that a place like Gippsland, which is the garden of the dairy industry&mdash;although other members of this House would argue about their particular electorates&mdash;and is a cow to the acre area and has been for generations of farmers in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dairy industry, was faced with the problem of not having enough water. There was not enough to grow grass or fill our tanks. We just did not have water after a time when we had had too much water. So we had a very unusual circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package, whose development has been so important to advance agriculture in Australia, has actually addressed the issues that were raised in Gippsland. Whilst I can see no benefit whatsoever from the crisis that we have gone through, and are still going through to a degree, in Gippsland&mdash;its effects on those farm families and households will continue for the next five years&mdash;to be granted `exceptional circumstances' was a very good, positive outcome and enhances the legislation we are putting through today, because it can be established with absolutely no doubt that the problems that we faced in Gippsland were considered in the consultations and have been driven into the legislation. So, for the first time in the history of this nation, people's situations will be considered in the merits of the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister, the member for Burke, said there has been some finetuning. This is fairly massive finetuning. For the first time, we have the opportunity to address the issues that people are facing in their areas and we are not being struck down by a rigid set of rules that we were unable to pass to get to the stage of saying, `Let these families start again.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that, as we come to look to a time 10, 15 or 30 years ahead as to where our farm families will be, we remember that they have not been forgotten in this. This legislation enhances our opportunity to give certainty and give direction to rural communities in Australia in the same way that the Howard government has done with the timber industry,.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say&mdash;and I think this is the time to bring it up&mdash;that one of the events that made a difference to the argument over `exceptional circumstances' in Gippsland goes back to the former season when a local farmer, Bill Pyle, came to me. Rather than saying, `I can see the storm clouds on the horizon,' he said, `I cannot see the storm 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9490"> clouds on the horizon, and we could be facing a problem.' That was way back in October last year. There did not seem to be a problem, but obviously the shortage of rainfall was beginning to be a concern. And who was it going to hit? It was not going to hit the well&hyphen;established farmers, it was not going to hit those people who have been through tough times, but we were seeing and going through a one in a hundred year event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I considered that with Mr Pyle and talked that through with him, and whilst there was not an immediate crisis, we looked at families who actually lived on the land and their entitlements to social security. Yesterday's report from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, talks about on-farm families not accessing what governments provide for them. This is not confined to Gippsland; this is absolutely all about the people who live on farms. They do not want to be welfare recipients&mdash;they have a proud heritage and they like to be given an opportunity to go on&mdash;but if they are faced with circumstances that are totally out of their control then we as a government have to respond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the farmers out there today who are having a tough time to accept the assistance. There would still be people in Gippsland in that situation, even though the government has said, `Look, we want to help you. We have got a handout. Please take this hand and come in and talk to us.' There will still be people out there who will refuse to take the opportunities that the government is presenting to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of months ago Mr John Bennett came to my Moe office. He walked in and said, `We've got a problem: a whole lot of share farmers can no longer afford to feed their families. They are buying hay with the money, and they are going to need some support.' We began in earnest not only to find ways in which the government could give information about what was available to such people at the time but also to look at whether we could do the job on drought exceptional circumstances. We did the research, we did the work and we committed ourselves through the state government to finding a way to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> address `exceptional circumstances'&mdash;in an area where this had not been heard of in 100 years. We have had droughts, floods and fires but we have not faced a situation like this before. With the help of the state government, we had to mount a fairly major argument to the federal government, to be presented to the RASAC committee which was in Canberra at that time. John Bennett was seriously concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time I took advice from other people who have greater knowledge than I on these issues&mdash;John Mulvaney; Wally Shaw from the Victorian Farmers Federation; Clay Manners; Mick Irwin, a farmer who let me know that there was a problem; Gary Owen, a share farmer; Glen Geoghegan, who took up the fight and badgered people about the crisis that we were facing and I do not use the word `crisis' lightly; Bill Brown from Murray Goulburn; and Michael Kearney. These people eventually all came together to talk to the minister. They made a difference in how we presented our argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The RASAC committee, which did the assessments, went right across Gippsland and talked to people and there was a clear understanding from this government. What happened? We did not get a response from the committee. We did not have a position that could make it simple for the minister to make a decision. I commend the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, who played a hand in delivering on `exceptional circumstances'. Peter McGauran, the member for Gippsland, stood with us through this whole process to ensure that the message from Gippsland was clear: that is, that we needed support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this legislation, we are not only investing in resources or farms, keeping these people on farms, but also investing in the future of the young people who will be supplying our milk. A number of people still think milk comes in cartons. It does not; it comes from the beautiful beasts in the fields today. The people who work seven days a week on these farms deserve our support and our help. We are looking to those young people. The household support legislation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9491"> gives older people an opportunity to get off the farms that are not making money and to hand them on to the next generation, so that we can get on with the show. But, at the same time, with this legislation we are going to assess your farm and decide whether you should go on or whether you should assess the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The information which farmers need is available from all local members from both sides of the House. I encourage farmers who are listening today to get this information from their local member or from the department. If they are in that category and are struggling, there are opportunities for them to be helped through the new Centrelink.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hand is out; there is no need. There are incentives for ongoing farm adjustment. We want to encourage social and economic development in rural areas and, importantly, to ensure the farm sector has access to an adequate welfare safety net. We are not offering them a free gift. It is a welfare safety net that this government and this nation has decided we should deliver to our people, whatever sector they are from. As the minister said, the bill has been carefully designed to meet the coalition's longstanding commitment to address important welfare issues and, at the same time, take into account the uniqueness of family farm business structures and the vulnerability of farming families to unnatural events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opportunities presented to us may be once in a lifetime opportunities. This is a tremendous $517 million package supplied by the people of Australia to make a difference to farm families. It is not to give them a loan which goes against the farm, as the former government gave them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to comment on a couple of things the shadow minister said. The former government's scheme was a loan based scheme. It left farm families with loans that they could not pay back. The shadow minister said, `We waived those.' No, this is a system that gives some certainty and credibility. The shadow minister seemed lost when he said, `This is very close to a hoax,' and then he said, `This is a hoax.' He has to decide which way he is going to go. In his opinion, is it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> close to a hoax or is it a very good package? He talked about being relaxed and comfortable with the package all the way through. He talked about Gippsland and the important role it had played in the formation of the policy and the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">State members of parliament supported us in our time of need, particularly Mr Peter Hall MLC, the member for Gippsland Province, who went out of his way to express to his colleagues what was happening in our area of Gippsland. That was also raised by the shadow minister, and I thank him for that. It is good that the people of Australia see both sides of the House supporting a package of legislation that is going to make a real difference to families across Australia, particularly in my electorate of McMillan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill liberalises the assets test. It gives farm families further opportunities to consider their futures and how they will go into the next millennium. Certainty and confidence has been delivered in this package to people in the rural sectors of Australia. It will be a great opportunity to take them into the new millennium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is special tax treatment, yes, and should it cross into other portfolios there should be reasonable consideration for those other portfolios, but we talk about the uniqueness of the farm family and it is important for a government to address that uniqueness. It is important for a government to look at the decline in rural communities right across Australia and say, `Hey, this can make a difference to a town; this can make a difference as to whether they've got a bank; this can make a difference as to whether they've got a local store.' Throughout this whole process of the problems of farm families we should remember that we are losing many of the small operators. A tragedy of farm families going down is that the overdrafts of those small operators go up and their businesses go down. It is not just the farm families who struggle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a package for the whole of regional Australia. It is an important package that makes a difference outside the cities&mdash;and this package does not start very far outside those cities. Just outside those cities we have farms 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9492"> that are not an opportunity to subdivide but certainly provide opportunities for people to do well in agriculture. It covers the whole of agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Great store was set by the fact that farm families will not access the opportunities given them by the federal government. Yes, you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make that horse drink, and that is what is happening with many of our farm families out there. It has happened to the point where the minister has had to come forward with a press release saying that we are providing a service for them and to please come along and avail themselves of the opportunities that the government has to give. The welfare is there. The social security net is there. The farm household support is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a continuing debate as to what is farm household support. What are we going to do in addressing the social security? How can we give farmers the same benefits that we give to those in the cities as far as social security is concerned? There will always be a balancing act in good governance, and in this package the government has considered good governance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Anderson took the time to come to Gippsland. He talked with my farmers and saw first hand exactly what was going on. On his own initiative he said that he would send the RASAC committee down there to assess the problem. After receiving reports from RASAC and his department on the issues, he then had to make a very difficult decision as to what he would take to cabinet. He laid on the table the problems of the people of Gippsland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governance works when you can have a local member from the backbench go to a minister and tell him of a problem, have the minister go to cabinet and lay that problem on the table, and receive a response that has made a difference not only in this case to the farmers of Gippsland but also to the policy development of this government. The bill has been supported by the Labor opposition, it has been supported by the whole of the parliament, and it has been broadly supported by the community that we all serve. After all, whether it be aged care or any of the prob 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lems that confront a government at any time, we are here for the people that we serve. We have had the opportunity in this package to deliver to the people in regional areas of Australia an opportunity to put their problems on the table and to have those problems addressed in legislation, and they are seeing the result of that now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This $517 million package has been put down and supported certainly by the National Farmers Federation and it has received consideration from all other farmers groups. It has been sold as a rescue package for the bush. I did not see this as a rescue package. I saw it as a package in which the Howard government was looking to the strategic future of regional Australia. I, for one, as the member for McMillan, want to be part of that strategic future. This package enables us to be part of the strategic future of Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<ANSWER PAGE="9494" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's quarterly inflation result&mdash;which I believe will be welcomed by all Australians&mdash;which show an underlying inflation of 1.5 per cent over the course of the year to September of this year is the best figures since the measure commenced in 1972. And the consumer price index over the year to September 1997 showed the best results since 1962; the best results since a band by the name of the Beatles came out of the Merseyside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Australians, with the exception of the Australian Labor Party, will welcome those wonderful figures. It is the best result in 35 years and all Australians will welcome them, apart from people who have no commitment to the national interest; people on the Labor Party side who are downcast about the best inflation result since 1962.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has led to that great inflation result? What led to that great inflation result was the fact that over the course of this year home mortgage interest charges contributed negative 26 per cent to the consumer price index. The price of a mortgage in relation to consumer prices went down by 26 per cent. Home buyers got the benefit of a price reduction in relation to their mortgage interest rates, the biggest expense of Australian households, as a consequence of low inflation and this government's commitment to the economic fundamentals. With the exception of the Australian Labor Party, all Australians will rejoice in that news today and all Australians will share in the benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you happen to be a pensioner, because of this inflation outcome you will know that you 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are protected against price rises. In fact in relation to the consumer price index a dollar would actually buy you more at the end of the year than it did at the beginning of the year. If you happened to be a self&hyphen;funded retiree, what you knew was that the value of your savings for the first time in decades had not been eaten away by inflation. The value of your savings at the end of the year was the value of your savings at the beginning of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you happen to be a wage earner, you know that your wage would buy as much, if not more, at the end of the year than it did at the beginning of the year. This sets Australia up to base its wages system on productivity rather than on inflation. This is an important point in relation to wage claims. Wage claims do not have to chase prices, because prices for the first time in decades in Australia are now under control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1980s, when Australia was locked into high inflation, when that was a bar on growth in our economy, we saw the average of consumer prices in the 1980s at 8.5 per cent. That was the legacy of Keating Labor. In the major industrialised nations it was 2.8 per cent. We were nearly four times worse than the developed nations of the world. But Australia can hold its head high now. Australia has an inflation performance which is, if not the best, certainly one of the best in the world. Australia has now returned decisively to the world club of low inflation nations. The inflation barrier on growth no longer exists. As a result of this, pensioners, home buyers, self&hyphen;funded retirees, but most of all the Australian nation, will be a great winner.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The message that the Democrats' rejection sends to the small business community is that the Labor Party and the Democrats are opposed to the small business community. They are opposed to what the small business community is trying to do. It shows you the incredible hypocrisy of these people. They created the problems of the unfair dismissal law, they were responsible for the problems of the unfair dismissal law and now they use their numbers in the Senate to prevent the further reforms to fix up the mess that they created. You ought to hang your heads in shame that you should oppose sensible measures to give a decent deal to the small business community and to those people who today are unemployed as a result of your economic mismanagement for years and years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of evidence&mdash;whether it is the Morgan and Banks survey, whether it is the Bell committee report, whether it is Recruitment Solutions&mdash;which show that if you could give a better system to the small business community then they would go out and give people jobs. This is the party that says, `Job insecurity is a problem in Australia.' You are the cause of job insecurity because you are opposed to a measure that will create jobs in the dynamic small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea that we should treat small business separately and distinctly to take account of the differences of small business is not a new idea. Whether it is the parole tax exemptions for small business, whether it is affirmative action, whether it is employment protection legislation in New South Wales supported by the Labor Party, it has been commonplace on both sides of politics in Australia to understand the particular needs of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that that measure says, in effect, is that small business needs to have a system that encourages them to go out and give people jobs. We say that any such system needs to properly take into account the interests of employers and the interests of employees. So 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9496"> this measure is directed to new employees, it does not affect apprenticeships and it retains all of the anti-discriminatory provisions of the federal law.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those on the other side are worried about the next election. A lot of people have said to me: `Will we have a double dissolution on this issue?' My answer to that is to say: `We want to fix up this problem.' We do not want an election over it. We want to see this problem fixed. We will present this bill in three months if you continue in your refusal. But our objective is to do the right thing by the small business community. We would like to see this bill through. We believe that there are a lot of people who today are unemployed who ought to have the chance of a job between now and Christmas.

<ANSWER PAGE="9498" SPEAKER="Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP" NAMEID="8E4" ELECTORATE="Chisholm" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Health and Family Services" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. There has been very great publicity in the last week about meningococcal disease and I would like to take the opportunity to inform the House of the situation relating to it. The first thing I should say is that the meningococcal organism is a bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis and it is very common. Probably 25 per cent of the population&mdash;one of every four of us in this chamber&mdash;have it in their throats at the moment. Normally it does not cause any difficulty, but in a very small proportion of people, and rarely, it can cause very horrific consequences. That does lead to a degree of fear in the community that is out of all proportion to the frequency with which this occurs. Last year in Australia there were 426 cases of meningococcal disease. At that level it would mean that the average GP could expect to see this once in a lifetime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Half the cases occur in late winter and early spring&mdash;from the middle of July to the middle of October&mdash;so it is normal that there is an increase at this time of the year. So far this year we have had 359 reported cases Australia&hyphen;wide, so there is no greater rate this year 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9499"> than is normal. It does have a seven per cent death rate, so it is a serious disease but, I stress, it is very, very rare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a vaccine, but the vaccine has serious limitations. Because there is such a low risk in the general population, because the vaccine is not particularly effective in children under two years of age, because of the time it takes to achieve immunity, because the vaccine does not cover 60 per cent of the neisseria that cause this and because of the need for frequent booster doses, vaccines are not recommended as being particularly effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there are three groups of people who may require vaccines. They are travellers to high risk areas, people over two years of age who have compromised immunity because of medical or surgical conditions and, finally, the people in a relatively closed community where an outbreak has occurred, where it has been identified that the subgroup causing the outbreak is one of the 40 per cent of cases that is susceptible to the vaccine. All this is spelt out in the sixth <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Handbook of Immunisation</EMPHASIS> that was distributed to every general practitioner in Australia earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some comment in the papers about the availability of vaccines in Australia. There are two vaccines, one by Smith, Kline and Beecham and the second by CSL. Smith Kline and Beecham currently has adequate stocks and is recalling army stocks just to be safe. CSL has run out of stocks and is expecting new stocks to arrive from Canada by the weekend. However, I stress that the role of the vaccine is limited and the public has no need, except in those very narrow circumstances, to go and get it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there was comment yesterday on the radio and television about which antibiotics to use and about whether or not appropriate antibiotics were being provided to doctors. I can only say that these comments must have arisen out of a misreading of the National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines which were released in April this year. The NHMRC, the country's peak scientific body, made it very clear that it was not appropriate to carry third generation cephalosporins in a doctor's bag and that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benzylpenicillin, the tried and true drug to which these organisms are still susceptible in Australia, is the drug of choice for a doctor's bag.

But we are in a situation where the announced program for this year will have family reunion at 50 per cent and skilled migration at 50 per cent. We have already seen in the settler arrivals a significant increase in the number of people coming into Australia through the skill streams, and I would expect that to increase. The only observation I would make is that that is important for Australia's economic development. The business skills category particularly provides significant economic benefit to Australia. It brings in human and financial capital, and research shows that it brings significant numbers of jobs and enhances our export potential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes, of course, along with the very much higher entry standards in the independent category, which are at historically high levels, are producing a significant benefit for Australia.

I was misrepresented by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who implied that I had imposed an injustice upon the naval logistics support personnel associated with the Vietnam War. In 1986, as the minister said, I did bring down a decision in that regard. That decision reversed a position which had been put in place under the Menzies government and persisted through five Liberal&hyphen;National Party administrations, which denied them any benefits at all&mdash;none whatsoever for those naval logistics personnel. I reversed that position and gave them that benefit. Far from imposing the injustice that he indicates, it rectified a Liberal injustice. Given the relationship of the particular government to their war service, it was a most inappropriate one.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As members would be aware, I have a number of privileges cases under consideration and today I intend to report to the House on two of them. On Thursday, 2 October the honourable member for Banks raised, as a matter of privilege, allegations to the effect that the Attorney&hyphen;General had interfered improperly in connection with an inquiry by the parliamentary joint committee on native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Banks presented a number of documents on the matter and made certain comments. Subsequently, the Attorney&hyphen;General spoke by indulgence and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> presented a number of other documents. I have now had an opportunity to examine all of the documents and the remarks of the two members. The following aspects are not in dispute: first, that the Law Reform Commission or its officers had been willing to give evidence to the parliamentary committee; secondly, that the Law Reform Commission officers later indicated that they did not intend to proceed with the giving of evidence; and, thirdly, that the Attorney&hyphen;General had certain views on the proposed giving of evidence or making of a submission to the committee by the commission and that his views were conveyed to the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dispute seems to centre on the nature and character of the actions taken by or on behalf of the Attorney&hyphen;General. It is evident that the Attorney had formed certain views on the role of the commission, that these were conveyed to the commission and that particular views were expressed in connection with the parliamentary committee's inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I see it, it is not claimed that the Attorney directed the commission not to give evidence. The member for Banks has characterised the relevant actions as a `determined effort by the government to frighten off' the commission. Clearly, different emphases can be, and have been, put on the matters asserted or claimed thus far. Under our current law if a contempt or breach of privilege has been committed, it would be because an action or actions amounted to or were intended or likely to amount to an improper interference with the free performance by the committee of its authority or functions. I refer there to section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case, if an offence had been committed, it could be constituted only by actions in respect of prospective witnesses. The statutory provisions of section 12 of the act are also relevant. It can certainly be argued that an action which interferes with the giving or proposed giving of evidence is a contempt, even if the action is otherwise lawful. I note, however, that in both sections 4 and 12 of the act the word `improper' is used with reference to actions which constitute contempts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My task is not to make a judgment as to whether a breach of privilege or a contempt 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9511"> has occurred. Rather, my duty is to form a view as to whether a prima facie case has been established. Having examined all of the material available to me, I am unable to form the opinion that a prima facie case of contempt has been made out and I do not consider the papers presented to the House constitute evidence of improper interference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the second complaint: the honourable member for Banks also raised the matter of the alleged unauthorised publication of certain documents presented by the Attorney&hyphen;General. As I understand it, these were a copy of a fax from the parliamentary committee to an officer of the Law Reform Commission and a letter from the committee secretary to the committee chair. It is not clear to me that in fact either document would be covered by the provisions of relevant standing orders dealing with the unauthorised disclosure of documents. Accordingly, in my opinion, a prima facie case has not been made out on this issue.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Lucky or unlucky, let us try to think about why he is the man sitting at the table today, especially given that you can imagine the member for Bass four weeks ago sitting in his ministerial office, waiting for the call from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to let him know what the impact would be for him of the cabinet reshuffle. There had been all the press speculation that he was about to be elevated to cabinet; a candidate for Attorney&hyphen;General; a possible minister for communications, given his experience in that area&mdash;and especially when you think back that in opposition he had been a very senior figure. He had been the manager of opposition business. He had had the responsibility under John Hewson for explaining to the Australian people why there should be a 10 per cent cut in the ABC's budget, losing his seat in the process. He was written up as one of the future leaders, one of the great white hopes of the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what went wrong? He was sitting there in his ministerial office waiting for the call from the Prime Minister four weeks ago. You can just imagine it: the phone rings, `It's John Howard here, Warwick. I have good news for you. You are the new Minister for Family Services.' Some of you might be wondering why the member for Bass is sitting in the outer ministry being Minister for Family Services, being handed the poison chalice for implementing this government's cutbacks in funding for aged care and being handed the poison chalice with the second poison pill of being responsible for child&hyphen;care fee increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for the Prime Minister's call can be found in this book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The End of Certainty</EMPHASIS>, a famous book written by Paul Kelly. If members turn to page 469, they will find that almost 10 years ago the member for Bass was conspiring with people like the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in trying to undo John 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9513"> Howard, the member for Bennelong, as the Leader of the Opposition. Many of us on this side would have thought that after 10 years John Howard would have forgiven Warwick Smith for his treachery. After 10 years you would have thought that John Howard, the Prime Minister, might have forgiven you, Warwick, for what you did on page 469 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The End of Certainty</EMPHASIS>. But when that call came through the member for Bass knew that John Howard never forgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, we have this minister losing responsibility for sport and territories and the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Today he is sitting at the table trying to explain to elderly Australians why they should pay more for their essential aged care. The House had a chance to put the minister on the spot today. We had a series of questions very ably put by my colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), who has been on almost every radio station program in the last 24 hours seeking to debate the Minister for Family Services and pleading with him to come out and explain the government's position.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only person who has had an opportunity to find out what the minister intends to do is Francis Sullivan from the Catholic Health Care Association. Mr Sullivan gave quite an interesting explanation about what the minister said to him last night. Mr Sullivan spoke on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> this morning. Mr Sullivan claimed to explain to the Australian public what the member for Bass and Minister for Family Services said to him last night. This is what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He also conceded that $80 million a year out of the aged care sector is untenable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what Francis Sullivan said that the minister said last night. When we put to the minister this afternoon at question time, `Do you deny that you told Francis Sullivan that it was untenable to take $80 million a year 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out of aged care?' the minister refused to deny it. It was quite clear to every member in this House that, when the member for Jagajaga put this minister on the spot as to whether he did concede to Francis Sullivan that he thought it was wrong or untenable to withdraw that $80 million, the minister refused to deny it. He also refused to deny that he told Francis Sullivan:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other difficulties this minister has is that yesterday he made a major error. He referred to the problems that the government has in convincing elderly people that they should pay up-front accommodation bonds and said that the Liberal Party and the government can overcome this problem by telling people, `It is easy, you can pay for it out of your estate.' That was the minister's new answer yesterday to the Liberal Party's public relations problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We put to the minister today, `Well, what does that mean?' For example, what does it mean to a pensioner who lives in the electorate of Dobell who is being asked to pay 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9514"> $100,000 as an up-front accommodation bond in for&hyphen;profit nursing home on the Central Coast? We asked the minister, `Doesn't it mean that they will be up for at least 8.863 per cent in compound interest on the amount that will be deducted from their estate and that after a very short period, if they die after five years, of that $100,000, $56,150 will be kept or taken from their estate?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know a lot about the death duties that used to apply a decade or two ago, but I do not think death duties were anywhere near as high as 56 per cent of the inheritance of younger children. Yet this minister is arguing that this is the answer for the accommodation bond. This is the real alternative to part pensioners who live in the electorates of Jagajaga or Dobell&mdash;part pensioners who are being asked to put $100,000. This minister says they should put that off and, instead, be up for $56,000 from their estates. It is just quite ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday the minister also told us that it is okay for Doug Moran to charge people who live in Rose Bay $250,000 as an up-front accommodation bond because that was only 25 per cent of the value of a home in Rose Bay. If the minister is saying that his finetuning will impose a new 25 per cent cap on the value of housing in an area, how does he explain to the part pensioners in his electorate, the part pensioners who live in Launceston, that they should pay up to 100 per cent of the value of their homes? If it is all right for a 25 per cent cap for the residents of Rose Bay, why will he not impose a 25 per cent cap on the value of a home in Launceston, which would put the cap at $20,000?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the battlers in Launceston&mdash;not the $250,000 cap that you refused to endorse here yesterday. This government is bouncing and lurching from crisis to crisis as it tries to explain these unfair, unjust and retrospective changes. They are unfair because they start to hit part pensioners when their non-pension income exceeds $50 a week. This is not simply something that hits people who are very well off. Pensioners are starting now to work out that it starts to hit them as part 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pensioners once their non-pension income exceeds only $50 a week in interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures are also unjust because those who can afford to pay more will get better aged care treatment, they will get the better nursing homes, they will get the better rooms in each of the for-profit nursing homes. Those part pensioners who cannot afford the large up&hyphen;front bonds will be receiving aged care of a much lower quality. What it means is that wealth and not health is going to determine the level of aged care and treatment that people will get for many years to come. So it is unfair, it is unjust and it is retrospective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes are retrospective because there are quite a few elderly people out there, retirees, who a few years ago sought out information on what the rules were so that they could perhaps give some money to their children. They might have given $30,000 to their kids to help them with a home deposit for a block of land. They would have contacted the Department of Social Security three years ago to find out what the impact would be on their pension if they did gift some money to their kids for a deposit. This minister and this government, with their retrospective changes, have said, `In addition to the changes to their pension, because they helped their kids with a home deposit, we are going to make them pay more in higher daily fees because they took the trouble of being generous to their kids, to help their kids out with a deposit on their home.' Quite clearly we have a minister and a government that are trying to introduce unfair, unjust and retrospective changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is coming from a government led by a Prime Minister who a few weeks ago in Hobart described the changes in these words: `These changes are fair, defensible and equitable.' Changes that force part pensioners to pay a higher daily fee when they earn only $50 a week are, according to the Prime Minister, `fair, defensible and equitable'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> summed it up quite clearly on the front page today. It said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Leader of the Opposition interjects, it is because we have a weak Prime Minister. He does not have the strength to face up to the fact that he has made a mistake. He is not man enough to admit that the government has done the wrong thing in aged care. He is not prepared to instruct this minister to scrap the changes. As a result, Warwick is here, beavering away, undermining the Prime Minister, trying to box the Prime Minister into a humiliating backdown. Yet, if we had a Prime Minister who had the strength, we might have actually had these measures scrapped some time ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But is it any wonder that the Prime Minister is unable or unwilling to act? We have a Prime Minister who has seen his mandate evaporate before his eyes in less than 18 months. We have resignations from ministers because of their share dealings and their travel arrangements. We have businessmen attacking the government because there is no national vision. There is cowardice in the response to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). We have pleas from Liberal Party Premiers calling for leadership from the Prime Minister on any issue. `Any issue, please,' Jeff Kennett says. `Just give us some leadership on anything so we can see that we have a Prime Minister who is trying to do the best by the country.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we have a Prime Minister who, with a dismissive flick of his hand as he walks up the stairs of the jet plane, breathes a sigh of relief that he is leaving behind all these problems with nursing homes, the problems with the implementation of the cutbacks that he has been responsible for. Last time, his great achievement on that overseas trip was to be seen in his big white shoes and shorts like Mickey Mouse walking around international capitals. Let us hope he is not quite as embarrassing this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, no matter what he does on his overseas trip, what we want him to do is to come back 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with a bit of strength; to come back as a Prime Minister who is willing to instruct the Minister for Family Services, the man whom he handed the poison chalice, to scrap these changes, to say to part pensioners, `We think that it is wrong to charge you more once you earn $50 a week.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give the minister a warning: if he cannot box the Prime Minister in and embarrass the Prime Minister into a backdown before 1 November, then it will be this minister who will be dead meat, not the Prime Minister, because come 1 November the new higher daily fees will take effect. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of part pensioners out there who have not yet been assessed by this minister's department. What the nursing homes and the hostels are telling the part pensioners today in the lead&hyphen;up to 1 November is that, if the department cannot get their act together and cannot complete the assessments by 1 November, people who are earning as little as $50 a week will be charged $420 a week until the department and the minister can sort out their own difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly we have a government that has been prepared to try to introduce unfair, unjust and retrospective changes that are going to hurt large numbers of elderly Australians. These changes are going to mean that the level of aged care and the quality of aged care that elderly Australians receive will be determined by their wealth and not their health. These measures should be scrapped. We know they are going to be scrapped. The question is: will this minister pay with his head before this government finally backs down? That is the answer we want to know, Minister. Is this going to cost you your political career as well as your place in cabinet?</PARA></SPEECH>

The first 10 minutes of the speech by the shadow minister for health&mdash;I was just saying that it is odd that he should be leading this debate&mdash;was a detailed analysis of my political career, details that I did not know myself from somewhere in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The End of Certainty</EMPHASIS> , the book by Paul Kelly. I have tremendous respect for Paul Kelly, but I do not ever remember Paul Kelly asking me what my views were about matters back in the early 1980s. But it is interesting, I guess, to go back to the 1980s. In 1988 the member for Dobell, in a debate concerning assets tests and social security issues, made some very interesting points. At that stage he was on the other side of the fence, arguing for responsible policy outcomes. That is what we are arguing for: responsible policy outcomes. He said this on 23 November 1988, quite a time ago:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having sat through debates in this chamber when members of the opposition sought to inflame fear in the community about the assets test, I wonder who is to blame for causing fear in the pensioner community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How the times have changed. Over the last several weeks it has been you who have been out there scaring the community. Today we heard the first question from the shadow 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister for veterans' affairs, trying to act concerned. We heard a question from the shadow minister for health trying to raise concerns about pharmaceutical benefits, which the Minster for Health (Dr Wooldridge) was able to put down straightaway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the reason why yesterday, for the first time, as I understand it, in this parliament since we took office, a censure motion was passed against the opposition. I would like to read it into the record again for the benefit of my colleagues and the benefit of those who are listening to this debate. We censured the opposition for four basic reasons yesterday. The first reason was for conducting a deliberate policy of misinformation in an effort to scare the aged in Australia. The second reason was for massively underfunding nursing homes and failing to introduce any mechanism to improve capital funding and improve standards in nursing homes. The third reason was for failing to disclose the tax it proposes to introduce to fund the nursing home sector. The fourth reason was for attempting to prey on the vulnerable for political advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That motion was passed yesterday. In proceeding that debate I put into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a quote from Senator Woodley from the Democrats. Remember that Senator Woodley, along with former Senator Kernot, supported the aged care legislation which has now been passed through the parliament, is an act and is the subject of this debate. They said that they were also disgusted at the scare campaign that was being conducted by the opposition. Responsible commentators in this country give you no credit for what you are doing in walking away from the fundamental requirements of addressing that 75 per cent&mdash;I had the graph in here the other day&mdash;reduction over the 13 years of the Hawke and Keating era in support for the capital requirements of nursing homes. That is a legacy this government now has to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is a little more than that. It is about standards in nursing homes. It is about affording aged Australians a quality of care now and into the future. It is about dealing with the age demographic, which I have so often talked about, positively and constructively. It is about making sure that the aged in our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9517"> community have facilities that are at a standard that we can be proud of as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said yesterday, we ought to be proud of a nation that venerates the aged, that gives them the standards which they deserve, which they have worked for. I do not think it is wrong, and neither do responsible commentators think it is wrong, to ask for some contribution towards the cost of nursing home care from those who can pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was some mention of Francis Sullivan. Indeed, I talked with him. I respect his contribution. I will not always agree with him and he will not always agree with me, but what he said to me last night, I thought, was quite telling. He said that personal responsibility and community contribution are the way ahead for the 1990s. That is the fundamental approach this government is taking. We are saying that those who can demonstratedly pay should make some contribution and that the government should make some contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quoted the figures. By the year 2001 over $3 billion will go into residential aged care in this country. I am advised that the average amount paid in support of residential aged care for the 135,000-odd people who are currently in nursing homes and hostels is about $15,000. That is the contribution that is continuing from this government, and that is a massive amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the graph, you will see that the increase in the outlays by this government for residential care facilities averages about three per cent in real terms. That is a significant amount of funds. We have 3,000 nursing homes and hostels in this country and we desperately want to provide them with a policy that recognises that the demand for entry will increase over time. We know that there will be a 50 per cent increase in the over&hyphen;80s age bracket between 1991 and the year 2000, many of whom will need to go into nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue that is fundamental and that must be addressed. It requires some policy changes. In pursuing policy changes, this government undertook a detailed period of consultation with consumer groups, with the industry and with a whole range of others to try to come together with a policy. That 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy was passed earlier in the year and has already started. The fee increases that start on 1 November relate to a means testing in a very fair way of those who are in homes. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have to make sure that people understand the facts&mdash;that 65 per cent of the people in nursing homes and hostels are not affected by the fees because they are pensioners and that 10 per cent of the remainder are not pensioners at all. We have in place a means test which is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. It follows closely on what has been done in the social security area where people are asked to make a contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there are hardships we will deal with them. There are hardship provisions there. We will deal with those hardships. Referring back to Mr Sullivan, I understand the view that he is putting forward and I will consider it. Indeed, I have seen comments from others who have different views and I will consider those as well. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, I am charged with considering all these matters in a sensible way. I have been minister for two weeks; I am not going to rush headlong into proposing changes that I know will not be good for the development of the long&hyphen;term needs of the elderly in this country. So I will consult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> a letter from Ralph Watson, the chief executive officer from the Catholic Centre for the Aged. He makes some interesting points. It is a very positive letter setting out the detail of the policy and expressing the view that this is a requirement for the long-term needs of the people in this country. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not seem unreasonable that the frail aged are provided with a higher standard of accommodation and service through a relatively modest levy on the assets they own.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Precisely. And Francis Sullivan also agrees with that fundamental principle. The distortion of the arguments being put by responsible commentators and by a responsible government possessed of a desire to deliver fair outcomes for all Australians leads to the conclusion that the purpose of the opposition's stance on these matters is purely and completely political. If you want any demonstration of that then you only have to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9518"> see what has taken place in this MPI today. Yesterday they moved a censure motion and it was reversed on them and we were able to censure them&mdash;first time ever. Today we had to have a balancing of the factional outcomes in the Labor Party to give the poor shadow minister for health a bit of a run. He talks about me being given a difficult job. He has been given a job that makes him invisible. He knows, and the leader knows, that if he does not get a bit of a run nobody up in the seat of Dobell will know whether he is still here or not. So he has to get a bit of a run.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To put it beyond doubt I can quote what the shadow minister said on radio. This is about dealing with the needs of the aged in this country.

For the opposition, the ones who have long supported the concept of death taxes, we wait with interest to see what form this new tax will take. How will it be imposed? Who will pay it? What else will they come up with? They are the sorts of things that we are certainly extremely concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I might reiterate what I said in question time about the interest rate. I know the shadow minister made mention of this 8.68 per cent interest rate. The matter is part of the legislation. The rate was agreed between all the parties&mdash;not the Labor Party, as I understand it&mdash;that were part of the consultation process to be a rate that is described in the legislation as a `maximum rate' that can be applied. It does nothing to detract from the opportunity for people to exercise choice as to how they might meet their bond application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said already, bonds will vary from $6,000 through to, as you said the other day, $250,000. The point is that you can only draw down $2,500 and at the end of five years the maximum that can come out of your bond is $13,000. I have taken steps to require that all the bonds that are going to be charged by homes be made broadly publicly available so that the community can have a good look at what nursing homes are doing. I would be interested in doing that too. That was part of the consultation process and that was agreed to by the nursing home sector during the long and detailed consultation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all we reject totally this MPI, this desperate attempt to continue this scare campaign that does nothing to contribute in any positive way to dealing with the needs and the demands of the aged in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is fond of using the expression `forelock tugging'. All I can say is that the Prime Minister must have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9519"> two forelocks if he is silly enough to think that this policy is fair, defensible and equitable. It is far from that indeed. What is annoying sitting here is that, as members of the opposition, we are asking questions which are coming through to all of our electoral offices&mdash;and let us be honest, they are coming through to all of our electoral offices; questions are questions are questions&mdash;and it is the answers or the lack thereof that is causing fear. We are asking the questions and you are failing to clarify, and you are failing to dispel those fears because of the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts of the matter are as follows. Firstly, the government is charging a bond for which there is no ceiling, no maximum. That is the first fact. If the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) is right in saying that this funding is urgently needed for capital improvement and in saying that the draw down is $2,600 a year over five years, to a maximum of $13,000, why isn't that $13,000 the ceiling or the cap? The reason $13,000 is not the cap is that capping it would not suit those people who have assisted in drafting this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One person who admits that he had a part in drafting this is Doug Moran. In my former life as a lawyer, I had cause to take legal action against one of the Moran companies. It is very interesting to go down to the Moran corporate premises just below Darlinghurst. You find there the premises of the Moran Health Group, the premises of the Moran aged care facilities, a shopfront real estate agency, the name of which is the Moran Real Estate Pty Ltd, and the premises of Moran Rental Properties Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Moran companies are doing very well in this equation. Not only is a $250,000 bond being paid, of which they get the benefit of 8.68 per cent interest which they can apply to their business activities, but also they are getting the benefit of selling people's properties or, through the rental company, renting them out, if they are substantial enough properties to attract sufficient rent to pay the bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moran, who is a multimillionaire, is laughing. He has drafted this policy. He is a massive contributor to the Liberal Party. He was, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> effectively, Senator Woods's power base, because of the financial contributions he made to the Liberal Party, and they have opened the door for him and said, `Here you are, this is your policy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the Doug Moran policy. There is no reason for any more than a $13,000 bond, if it is the $13,000 that is being applied to the upgrading of the capital of nursing homes. As I have said, the reason that $13,000 is not set as the cap or the ceiling is that people in the industry could not profiteer with 8.68 per cent interest bearing deposits coming into their resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other side of the equation, even if the bond is less than half what Doug Moran is charging, even if it is $100,000, what happens to the relatives of the person who has to be admitted to the nursing home? Effectively they have to pay a death duty of $56,000&mdash;or 56 per cent&mdash;on that $100,000. That is a death duty which does not apply across the board. It is a death duty which strikes the very frail, the very ill or the demented. That, quite simply, is wrong. It is only those who are lucky enough to die in their own homes who are going to escape that death duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second fact of the matter is that the government says that no&hyphen;one is worse off as a result of the changed daily fee arrangements. On 20 October the Minister for Family Services said in respect of the abolition of rent assistance that the changes would not significantly affect disposable incomes. The minister should look at what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One case, referred to in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 2 October is that of a pensioner called Eileen Dwyer. She was previously getting $31.50 a week. Under the new regime she will get $26 a week. That is a reduction of $5.50 per week. As she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even ringing the family once a week is a luxury now. Instead of ringing them every week or every fortnight, I will have to think about doing it less because it will be impossible for me to cut down on medicines.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She is an evil person, isn't she? She is a terrible human being. She is part of this scare campaign. What an atrocious thing that people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9520"> are presenting the facts to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Chief Executive Officer of Baptist Community Services said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These people have to pay for their incidentals such as soap, toiletries, clothes, phone bills, any social activities or even family presents out of this $26 a week.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Five dollars, thank you very much, minister, on that level of income, is a very substantial whack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third fact is that anyone who earns in excess of the pension&hyphen;free amount of $50 is going to have to pay an extra 25 per cent in every dollar they earn above that pension free area. That, effectively, is a 25 per cent additional tax. It is a tax windfall of $80 million obtained from those people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On top of the current tax they are already paying, as the shadow minister points out. Fortunately there may be some decency. It is being suggested that the minister acknowledges the immorality of that situation, and we trust he is going to change that. But the government says that the position is not harsh, because people have six months to pay the bond&mdash;if they do not die within that time. I suppose that is an escape for them, but we do not want that escape. The reality, which the minister does not talk about, is that they are accruing that interest of 8.68 per cent on their arrears all the time and that they will have to cough up with that after the six months period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister next says that people do not have to sell their homes; they can pay their bonds by instalments. It is not only a question, as we pointed out, of finding the $2,600 per year; they also have to find the money to pay the $100,000 bond or, in the case of the Doug Moran group of companies, the $250,000 bond. But, in the case of a bond of $100,000, the instalments equate to about $400 per week. The minister would acknowledge, I trust, that you would have to have a very substantial property to be able to raise that amount of money through rental. Firstly, you would pay tax on that, and then any income would affect your pension status, so it is very likely that that pension would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> completely fall away if the person was able to obtain that sort of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that money talks. The government is not about improving health care at all; it is about pursuing this philosophically driven, user&hyphen;pays concept. It is only the frail, the ill and the demented&mdash;the users&mdash;who will have to pay. There is no question that money talks. If you are poor, you are going to be able to obtain only substandard service. Those who are very wealthy and who have the spare cash will no doubt be able to buy $250,000 accommodation at Rose Bay which will be, needless to say, quite pleasant. But the vast bulk of ordinary Australians who have met with misfortune are going to come butt&hyphen;up against this government's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they are struck by misfortune, this government will latch on to them like parasites. That is entirely wrong and the government is going to pay dearly at the next election.

We were told that if someone takes one of the three options for establishing their bond arrangements&mdash;that of retaining their family home and having any charges that accumulate during their occupancy of a nursing home charged against their estate, which of course went on for decades under the previous Labor government in terms of rent rebates and was never referred to as a death duty&mdash;they will, in the extreme example of $100,000 over the absolute maximum of five years, be up for $56,000. But apparently for that whole five years the house they have chosen to retain remains vacant. They do not rent it out. They leave it there and let it fall to pieces. But if they rent it out for $200 a week they get $50,000 back. That leaves them losing $6,000, which is less than $13,000.

The 85 per cent who, as the member for Barton says, are lucky enough to die in their own home are financially worse off than the pensioners you are crying crocodile tears about in the hope of getting re&hyphen;elected. And you talk about fairness. Clearly, fairness goes to the side of those who do not go into a nursing home. They are the ones who are worse off. You might be up here talking about them. And you carry on, `It's their family home!' A typical Australian family sells their house every seven years. Which was the family one?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You talk about being kind, fair and reasonable. I do not follow New South Wales politics closely, but I remember a picture of an old person in their old house that just happens to have harbour views. And Bob Carr has just revalued it at $2 million or $3 million and slapped property taxes on it. That is fair, you say. They are going to die in that house, but you say that is fair. Why? Because Labor did it. I do not know what it is costing those people to be lucky to die in their own house. But isn't it amazing? Yesterday, did we hear one thing about the battlers? No, the only case that you wanted to run was for the chardonnay set. Rose Bay! Why don't you put another one in for Toorak, or Peppermint Grove in my state? I know why you did it. You wanted to point out that a $250,000 bond has got absolutely no relevance whatsoever 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out in the western suburbs of Sydney, but you wanted to scare those people out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the other people who live in the western suburbs? I rang up today, to make sure. They are the ones who are paying a mortgage, paying the rates and taxes, trying to educate three kids and, if they are earning somewhere between $400 and $500 a week, they are already paying $80 a week in income tax out of that amount of money. And what is your solution? When you talk about tax I just say to myself, `Why would you believe them?' You have never ever kept a promise on tax in your life, but this one you might keep. What are you going to do? Are you going to add to the 47 per cent, the maximum marginal tax rate at the moment? I can tell you that, if you do, you will not get very much money anyway. I know what you will do: you will go and add to the middle level rates and you will add to that $80 out of $450, and that bloke might just decide to give up and go on the dole because you have left him with so little. But what is fair for them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental fact of this matter is that the nursing home industry is in diabolical trouble in terms of its capitalisation, its maintenance and its development. Someone has to find some money; you say it is the government, we say it is those amongst the aged community that have the ability to pay. Let us talk about the options. You can put up income tax. We have the great triumvirate for death duties: the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), who are both on the record, and the third one, who does not have a seat yet, is ex&hyphen;Senator Kernot. She is now, according to her own claims in the media, your tax policy adviser. That is why you are going to pay her for the next 12 months&mdash;so she can write policy for you. Have you ever read any of her wacky tax policies? Death duties is at the head of the list, and there are some other pretty tough ones too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Which tax are you going to raise? Are you going to raise company tax and further deteriorate the ability of our companies to employ people? Or are you going to get back to the old faithful of borrowing some money and leaving it to the kids of Australia. What effect 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9522"> does that have on our capacity to help the elderly? I brought it here. With regard to budget outlays, by function, it says $8,900 million. We are paying $9,321 million of interest this year. That is three times what we spend on aged persons. If you take it in portions, like what Fraser left behind&mdash;$20,000 million&mdash;and what you added to it, you could double or even treble, taking what we are spending now, the amount of money being spent on aged persons if you had not left them with that interest bill. It is your interest bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me get a couple of these facts on the record. Firstly, there is an entry process in all this matter which puts total emphasis on needs, not means. Secondly, 27 per cent of nursing home places must be reserved for people whose assets are less than $22,500. They will pay no bond. Thirdly, there is no requirement that anyone pays a bond because they have the various choices we have mentioned. Clearly, those people who take the opportunity to take it out of their estate have got an estate and they make that decision because they know it will earn them good money. Yes, they will pay taxes and they may lose their pension&mdash;and they may be the bloke in Sydney who got $14 million for his house the other day. I think he will struggle along without the pension. You are standing up here crying crocodile tears for people like that.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill is the first of two bills whose purpose is to introduce a new method of calculating the safety net surcharge component of the customs and excise duty on certain tobacco products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 5 August 1997, the High Court held that the New South Wales tobacco business franchise fees were invalid. This decision also 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9523"> cast considerable doubt upon the constitutional validity of other state and territory business franchise fees on tobacco, alcohol and some petroleum products. In order to protect state and territory revenues following this decision, the Commonwealth agreed to a safety net, part of which involved increases in customs and excise duties on certain tobacco products of $167 per kilogram.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time these increases were implemented, the Commonwealth government was aware of the effect that changing from a value based franchise fee system to a weight based system would have on the tobacco industry. Following the High Court decision, the states and territories held discussions with the industry and have agreed to a revised level of taxation and new arrangements for the levying of the surcharge. These arrangements will shift from a solely weighted based surcharge to one based on both weight and value. They will ensure that the effect of the safety net on the manufacturers of the different tobacco products is as close as possible to effect of the business franchise fees which applied prior to the High Court decision. All of the states and territories have requested the Commonwealth to implement these new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will introduce the new arrangements in relation to customs duty on tobacco products. Identical changes to the method of calculating excise duty on tobacco products are proposed in the  Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997 . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the revenues collected under this Amendment Act and the  Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997  will continue to be returned to the states and territories under the provisions of the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994. The states and territories have also asked that the Commonwealth adjust the shares for tobacco products being returned to the states and territories under that act and these amendments are being made by the  States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 .

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report which I have tabled concerns the proposed extension of the National Film and Sound Archive, Acton, ACT. The archive is housed in a historic building, formerly the Australian Institute of Anatomy. In passing, I should mention that this building was the subject of an inquiry by a previous Public Works Committee, in 1929. It cost just over &pound;96,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal is substantially similar to one examined by the committee in December 1995. Although a public hearing was held into the proposal, the committee was unable to report on the reference due to the calling of the election. The proposal was re&hyphen;referred to the committee in August and, because of the substantial body of evidence taken by the previous committee, it was not considered necessary to conduct further hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scope of the proposal examined by the committee involved the construction of:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a new two&hyphen;storey building to house the archive's administrative and technical functions, and refurbishment of the existing headquarters&mdash;including public galleries&mdash;to house the public functions of the National Film and Sound Archive;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> refurbishment of the existing residence building to house corporate affairs staff;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> demolition or removal for sale of the existing demountable buildings, metal&hyphen;clad storage structures and nitrate vaults;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> redevelopment of the character of the site and buildings within a landscape setting; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> retention of the existing permanent car park with minor modifications. Additional on&hyphen;site parking will be provided for approximately 25 cars and five tourist coaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When referred to the committee, the estimated outturn cost of the proposal was $14.85 million. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Film and Sound Archive was established in 1984 and has as its charter the development, preservation and promotion of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the national collection of recorded moving images and sound materials. The archive's collection consists of more than one million items including discs, audio and video tapes, films, phonograph cylinders, piano rolls and artefacts, and a further million items of documentation such as photographs, scripts, publicity items and newspaper clippings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After inspecting the buildings housing the archive at Acton, the committee found that the main historic headquarters building is suitable for the public functions of the archive but is inadequate for its administrative and specialist technical functions. Existing deficiencies are:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the basement specialist technical facilities are inefficient and do not satisfy current occupational health and safety standards, including in particular fire safety, the Building Code of Australia and Australian standards relating to current use;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the use of gallery space for office and specialist technical accommodation is at odds with the building's heritage significance and limits the space available for public exhibitions; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the construction of demountable buildings has substantially compromised the site's heritage significance and is not consistent with the intentions of the national capital plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After inspecting the specialist technical facilities in the basement and registration and accession areas housed in demountable buildings, the committee came away with a strong perception that the archive is indeed served by a dedicated staff. The staff have displayed stoic forbearance in very difficult working conditions. It was obvious that the major concern of staff has been to keep the facilities operating despite potential safety risks. Anybody who has had anything to do with nitrate film would know that it is extremely volatile and should only be handled in the safest places. The committee concluded that the archive's administrative and technical accommodation is of very low quality, functionally unsuitable and inefficient and does not comply with current fire safety and occupational health and safety standards.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9525">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After examining a range of options which would overcome these problems, the committee concluded that the construction of a new administrative and technical support building contiguous with the existing headquarters building at Acton would be the least expensive and more practical solution. The major element of the proposal examined by the committee will involve the construction of a new two&hyphen;storey building of 4,230 square metres along the north&hyphen;west of the existing headquarters building to house the archive's administrative and technical functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The site occupied by the archive's buildings is within designated areas of the national capital plan. As well, the site and the headquarters building are listed on the Register of the National Estate. For these reasons, planning and design of the extensions required a sensitive approach. The extension has been designed to respect, but not to mimic, the existing building. The committee concluded that the heritage importance of the site and the existing headquarters building are reflected in planning principles adopted for the design. The materials and finishes to be used will complement the existing headquarters building.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the scope of the proposal, the committee concluded that the extent of the proposed new building will meet the requirements of the National Film and Sound Archive for at least the next 10 years. It will improve efficiency, enable display areas to be increased and will attract more visitors. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take pleasure in resuming the debate on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill 1997. Before I was interrupted, I was making the point that this legislation recognises the plight of the long&hyphen;suffering agricultural sector. I was reminding the House, and I hope those in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nation who can recall, of the issues of the late 1980s with 18 to 20 per cent interest rates and the assets test for pensioners, and how people became locked in to pretty unfortunate circumstances in transferring the farm from generation to generation. The income equalisation deposits which had been introduced by the Fraser government had effectively been abolished by the Labor government, as had the drought support, which I guess had become almost a part of the institution of agriculture in recognising that there were difficulties that could arise from time to time where it was beyond the reasonable expectation of farmers to manage by themselves. To have this measure brought before the parliament gives me particular pleasure. I must acknowledge the contribution of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and his untiring efforts in the interests of the people of agriculture throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 1997 do? Put simply, the bill establishes the farm family restart scheme and the exceptional circumstances relief payment. It endeavours to focus on those under greatest pressure in the agriculture sector and allows that light on the hill, if you like, which can allow them to move on from agriculture where the circumstances have become just too difficult. It is not compulsory. It is done in a particular way which I think is very humane and compassionate, but it does recognise that there has been a very large backlog of many families in agriculture in intergenerational transfer and in their very economic survival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That comes on top of a very commendable reform process by the new government over the last 18 months. This government has been in power for just on 18 months and its achievements particularly in the agricultural sector, but also I think right across the nation, are quite remarkable. We are looking at somewhere near a $2 billion surplus after a $10 billion deficit. That now is seen to be of not much account; it is yesterday's news. It is something that the government just did, which really did not take very much effort&mdash;after all, it really was not that bad anyway.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HV5">Mr WAKELIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very short memories, as the member for Wakefield reminds me. To achieve that sort of turnaround takes a strong effort day by day and hour by hour by all members, particularly the senior executive&mdash;the Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the cabinet&mdash;supported by a very united coalition team. It is with great pleasure and pride that I serve in this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of managing the $10 billion deficit has been five interest rate cuts in a row. They currently are worth about $500 million in savings to Australian farmers. It is quite remarkable that, just as a result of that, the average farm income has increased by $6,000 per farm. In fact, each one per cent cut in interest rates can boost net farm income by about $2,400.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to constantly remind the House that, contrary to the perception of years gone by that there is great individual wealth in agriculture, we now see a situation where the regional sectors of Australia, particularly the farm sector, are very much at the lower income spectrum as far as average incomes go across Australia. So it is with pleasure and heartfelt gratitude that I see the efforts of the government coming into practical effect for the purposes of people on the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people on the land do not ask for hand&hyphen;outs. They ask for an opportunity to contribute. They ask that they be recognised for their historical place in laying the foundations of our nation. They also ask, I believe, that the export income that is still being produced be a significant contributor to the overall wellbeing of our standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other very good initiative that the government has embarked upon is the Natural Heritage Trust grant, and I was very pleased to announce to the electorate of Grey last week a grant of $1 million. As we know, the $1.2 billion contribution from the one-third sale of Telstra is for the restoration and improvement of the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are the improvements in quarantine laws, industrial relations reform, reforms to the Australian Wheat Board, the supermarket to Asia strategy and the improvements in respect of rural doctors. We now are particu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> larly looking at the departments of rural health and at the health issues of the rural sector. There is also the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund, which I must say my electorate has taken to with great enthusiasm. They see some very positive outcomes in the telecommunications area and would like to access that fund. Of course, there is also capital gains tax reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming back to the bill, the advancing agriculture package draws together various rural policies into a coordinated and integrated plan for agriculture based on wide industry consultation and support. It is pleasing to see the rural media endorsing the package with some enthusiasm after many years of neglect. It is not surprising that many people in regional areas feel that they are very often the forgotten people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will mention some components of the bill. The farm family restart scheme, which has $120.4 million and is to start on 1 December 1997, provides a maximum of one year of income support, which is available without the need to put the farm on the market, and no activity test will apply. There is an obligation to obtain financial advice, and there will be government support to do that. That advice will seek to determine the future viability of the farm and alternative employment options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As sad as that situation appears at the time, I know the great relief that people feel when facing up to that hard option, making the decision and moving on. It is a great release and relief to many once they have made those decisions. I know that no-one does it easily. I come from a community where it is always with a heavy heart that you see someone leave the land. But, when that decision comes, it is always inspirational to see the community gathered around in support of that person, helping them through a very difficult time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Re-establishment grants, which have been there before but this extends it and makes it a stronger component of the farm family restart scheme, of up to $45,000 will be available to those who choose to leave farming in the first two years of the scheme and payable on the farm sale. The income support years will be deducted from the grant. The grant will be subject to an assets test, where 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9527"> it will be phased down by $2 in every $3 above $90,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farm household support scheme is a $5.1 million component. The grant measure was chosen in preference to a loan because of the abysmal failure of the previous program. That scheme was terminated last year, and the $5 million owed by low income farmers will be written off. The small amount repaid will be reimbursed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drought relief payment extension, involving $40.5 million, provides a safety net for farmers losing the drought relief payment recovery period. It was extended to 10 September and will now be extended to 30 November to allow for the start of the farm family restart scheme. The new exceptional circumstances relief payment will be established for those in financial hardship as a result of exceptional circumstances, including drought. Duration will be determined on a case by case basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I warmly applaud this bill. It will advance agriculture, as well as Australia. As I said in my earlier comments, it comes in stark contrast to the disappointing performance of my political opponents, who never came to terms with the reality of working the soil and the variation that is always present in agriculture. I have never been so disappointed than when the previous government abolished the income equalisation deposit scheme. It epitomised what was one of the great positives of this country&mdash;people endeavouring to make progress by themselves.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HV5">Mr WAKELIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. That is the self-reliant attitude of agriculture. The income equalisation deposit scheme of the Fraser government epitomised that great variation in agriculture where you can get a variation of 10. It is very difficult to explain to a CPI salary earner the great variation. When the good years come, the tax man cometh as well, which very much weakened the capacity to cater for the more difficult years that you always knew were there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When that income equalisation deposit scheme was abolished, I never quite forgave the government of the day. It recognised that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> absolute determination by so many in agriculture and so many within Australia who wished not to be on government support, who wished to remain self&hyphen;reliant and pay their own way. If you can give people a mechanism whereby they can do that, it is a great step forward for the nation at large. I record in the chamber today with great feeling that it was a great disappointment to me to see the previous government do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was quite ironic to see the subsequent ministers who came and went. It was eventually Senator Collins who, in the latter part of the Keating government, reinstated the income equalisation deposits almost to what they were in the Fraser years. It took only 10 or 15 years to complete the full circle. Now we are going on and reforming and improving that program again by working with the banks and making it very much more an integral part of the farm management program. Whilst it is not directly related to this bill, it is part of the overall package, Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summing up, it is with great pride that I stand here, and, in all humility, I think this bill is a recognition of the contribution of agriculture and of those who stay in agriculture. The more I listen to the comments about the up&hyphen;and&hyphen;coming generation in agriculture, the more encouraged I am because we have some extremely talented and capable managers coming through, supported by the previous generation. This legislation will allow agriculture to look forward to its future in the next century with great confidence and contribute to the wellbeing of all of us over the medium and longer term.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R324">Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill 1997</XREF> and to follow the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), an electoral neighbour of mine in boundary terms. While I am on my feet, I recognise that there is probably no-one in this House more familiar with the role and importance of this legislation than the member for Grey. There will be those in the gallery and many in the House who will not be aware of the fact that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9528"> member for Grey's electorate takes up 92 per cent of the surface area of the state of South Australia. It includes all of the vast Eyre Peninsula, stretching, as his electorate does, from the fertile valley of Clare across the Eyre Peninsula to Western Australia and north to the Northern Territory border. It is scarcely surprising then that he should have a certain passion for this debate, particularly as much of his Eyre Peninsula area includes some of the marginal grain farming areas of South Australia. As he has indicated, he has witnessed people leaving the farm with little more than that in which they stand up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, recognising that farming families frequently find themselves in difficulty through no fault of their own and frequently find themselves being chased by the banker simply because unpredictable seasonal conditions have moved against them, has endeavoured to find a way to allow farming families to stop, reassess their farming situation and, if necessary, leave the land with a level of dignity that was not possible before. I join the member for Grey and the recently appointed Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), the member for Wide Bay, and the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), all of whom are familiar with farming in Australia, to celebrate what has been done by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is sadly a popular view abroad in the community that Australia is teetering on the brink of economic collapse, as if all was wrong with the nation and the parliament was to blame, not the Liberal Party, the National Party or the Labor Party. The reality is quite different. The perception of economic disaster hangs so gloomily over this chamber largely because of the sort of nonsense that has been advanced by people such as the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), suggesting that the major thrust of the government and of the opposition when it was in government has been in the wrong direction and has been to the disadvantage of Australian farmers and Australian farming families.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been tough on the land. It has been tough on the land for reasons of international trade. It has been tough on the land because in parts of Australia, particularly in Queensland, there have been major environmental and climatic situations which have been quite unpredictable. What needs to be recognised is that in a portion of Australia's manufacturing area&mdash;that is not in primary industry or mining, but in our manufacturing base&mdash;things have been heading in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians seem to believe that everything that is happening in this country right now is simply the result of imports coming in and of exports being thwarted, but the facts are that Australia's export performance is on the mend. The fastest growing area of Australian exports has astonishingly not been the agricultural goods directly referred to in this  legislation but manufactured goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask you: how many Australians, if you stop them in Collins Street, could tell you that among the dramatic improvements that have occurred in the Australian economy over the last 10 years&mdash;I am not being political, let me hasten to add&mdash;has been the level of export manufactured goods leaving our shores, to the point at which Australian manufacturing exports now rival both primary industry and mining in their volume? Australian manufactured exports now sit as I understand it at approximately $30 billion of all that we export. The figure for both primary industry and mining is a comparable one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So not all that has been done by this parliament has been in error, in spite of the popular opinion outside this place. Our performance in manufacturing has been dramatically different. The area that has been most frustrating for the parliament has been the area of primary industry because the reforms that occurred in international trade that allowed us to so effectively improve our manufacturing sales overseas were not running hand in glove with similar reforms in agricultural trade. It has been difficult for farmers under the terms of trade that existed to penetrate the grain markets that they wanted and to succeed in the wool markets that they would have sought. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9529">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has joined us. In an electorate like his he will be even more familiar with the difficulties that many farming families have faced. As a result of these difficulties and as a result of the terms of trade largely being dictated by corrupted trading arrangements overseas in agricultural product, many Australian farmers and many Australian farming families have found it difficult to remain in farming production. It is not that they have been poor farmers. In some cases they have been farmers on tracts of land that have proven progressively to be too small to be viable. In many cases they have found themselves with farming equipment that has been ageing. For those reasons they have not been able to be as efficient as they would wish and they have found themselves caught in a vicious cycle because they were unable to replace the farm equipment since the production was too low to service the debt that would be incurred with new farm equipment being purchased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pick up the comments of the member for Grey. Briefly, but in a sustained way over the last 18 months, it has been possible for farmers to be both more productive and more profitable. This is partially because the government's economic management has been such that interest rates have been down and, as the member for Grey has indicated, up to $6,000 per farm has been saved as a result of sustained lower interest rates kept in place by this government. In fact it takes a fall of only one per cent in interest rates to produce a saving of $2,400 per annum for a farm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government has taken action by setting the economic parameters where they ought to be. But that is not the only action we have taken. The government can also proudly claim to have built on the trade reforms that the former government had initiated to the advantage of Australian farming families. As I indicated in my opening remarks, manufacturing exports had improved because of the trade reforms that had been initiated. Now we are in a situation where Australian agricultural exports are improving as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are here in this chamber, our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is on his way to, or has arrived at, CHOGM, the Common 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wealth Heads of Government Meeting, where in fact the focus of the meeting will be on trade liberalisation, principally in agriculture, and where the Prime Minister will be putting the case for Australian farmers to ensure that the same sort of trade liberalisation that has advantaged manufactured goods can be used to advantage our farmers as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trade liberalisation, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you understand from your period in government, has a great deal to do with market access. Australian farmers have been denied access to those markets in which they could have most effectively sold their goods because the markets were being filled by agricultural product produced in countries that subsidised their farmers, making it impossible for us to compete. There have been those who have suggested that Australia ought to subsidise its farmers as well. But the grim economic reality is that Australia with some 12 million taxpayers cannot hope to match the subsidy base of Europe or the United States of America with over 200 million taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a bill before the House which allows those farmers who find it difficult to compete in international terms to leave the land with dignity. I am not here suggesting that bigger is better. I am not here suggesting that, in some strange way, farmers should simply work from larger farming bases in order to be effective and efficient farmers. In fact, in my own area of Wakefield, among the irrigation areas there are those in intensive crops who have moved out of one form of farming into another, who have moved for example from horticulture into floriculture and who have found that small areas can in fact be very viable if they select the crop that is most appropriate to the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But for the Mallee farmers represented by the member for Grey and for the farmers who are part of the electorate of O'Connor, the reality is that, unless they are on a large enough area to be economical, it is hard to find a way out of the continuing spiral downwards that catches them in terms of their economic management because, as I said earlier, they find themselves unable to produce enough to replace the machinery that is needed to be efficient in Australian farming. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9530"> They are, as we all know, the classic case of people who are asset rich but cash poor because they have an asset that is valuable but not generating sufficient income for them to maintain a viable farming base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are also the people who, in spite of their financial difficulties, are least likely to go broke. They will ultimately use up all of their capacity to borrow money from the bank. They will ultimately find themselves in a situation in which the bank is no longer prepared to use the farm as part of the collateral against which the banker lends them money. But it takes time. If they are in a corner store and are not generating income, they find themselves rapidly pushed out of business by costs, rates and taxes. But many farmers on small farms simply contract. They refuse to replace the truck; they refuse to replace the header or the tractor. They choose to do all sorts of extraordinary things like keeping a cow to minimise the cost of buying milk and starting a farm garden. Slowly they find that their asset base contracts, but their capacity to generate money also contracts. Finally, they are forced into a position of sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is proposing that farmers in that situation should be able to access the farm family restart scheme through this legislation. Under the farm family restart scheme, it should be possible for them to qualify for the newstart allowance and for the partner allowance and to get that form of income support for at least 12 months while they determine what the future of the family farm ought to be. That is a very useful step because it means that they are not forced off the land, but in that 12-month period they have an obligation to seek advice from a professional financial adviser on the future viability of the land. In counselling with somebody else, they can make a decision about what will suit them best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government proposes that they should be able to access a maximum under this legislation of $45,000 of re&hyphen;establishment grant so that they can leave the land with some sort of dignity. If their assets have run down to the point at which they sell the farm for a cleared price of $90,000 or less, it should be possible to top up that money with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $45,000 and re&hyphen;establish themselves somewhere else without feeling that they have in any sense been a failure. Frankly, they have not. What has caught them is circumstantial arrangements rather than any failure on their part to run an efficient and effective business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that this bill gives Australian farming families the opportunity to make a decision to stay on the land, to enter into a partnership with a neighbour, to enter into a share farming agreement, to enter into a leasing agreement, or, if they wish to leave but not be financially disadvantaged by so doing, to decide to leave before they are at the point at which all of their assets have been exhausted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Grey said, the bill that we are currently considering deals with the question of exceptional circumstances and drought relief and the way in which we go about offering farmers support where some change in the weather conditions, some prolonged period of drought or some exceptional circumstance has forced them into a situation in which they would otherwise be viable. The bill offers more generous exceptional circumstances grants to allow them to make a decision on what their future will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exceptional circumstance grants apply where the normal farm risk management&mdash;that is, the normal risks that you would expect if you were farming an area that is marginal&mdash;has been exceeded and where prolonged drought&mdash;a drought such as would not be a part of the normal cyclical drought of Australian farming&mdash;triggers the exceptional circumstances provisions in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude where I began. There is not really a reason for a great deal of despondency about either the nation or its farming viability. Because this nation has farmers and primary producers that have not been subsidised, that have not been subject to all sorts of insulation from the reality of world markets, we find ourselves producing agricultural product that can be sold overseas into any non-corrupted market at a profit. That is something every Australian primary producer should be proud of. The changed trading arrangements have meant that our dairy industry, our grain industry and our viticultur 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9531"> al industries have been enjoying relatively buoyant times. The buoyancy of the grain industry is largely conditioned by the seasonal arrangements in which it finds itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that some horticultural industries, the wool industry and, until about six weeks ago, the beef industry have been having an exceedingly difficult time because of changed marketing arrangements. Nonetheless, the access that we as primary producers in this nation now enjoy to markets that were once closed to us is a very promising sign. As the member for Wakefield, I will be hosting a Supermarket to Asia conference in my electorate in two days time, on Friday, to allow some of my farmers and their processors to look at ways in which they can maximise the inroads they can make with primary products into the Asian market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Supermarket to Asia Council, as the House is well aware, has been a creature of this government. It is chaired by the Prime Minister and includes a number of front bench members. The purpose of the Supermarket to Asia Council is to ensure that no stone is left unturned in the effort to maximise our penetration of the promising Asian market. As someone who represents South Australia's key viticultural area, I am very conscious of what has been done to improve the access of primary products into overseas markets, particularly wine, as a result of the present trading arrangements under which we operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We confidently believe those trading arrangements will be further liberalised to the advantage of every Australian primary producer. Our role as a parliament is to ensure that those primary producers who do not want to move into the new era of agriculture that is emerging can leave the agricultural industries with dignity. This bill allows them to do just that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R324">Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill 1997</XREF>  is part of a very substantial package announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) some time ago and it brings together a very appropriate and sensible package that will do much to guaran 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tee the future of Australia's agricultural sector, which is of course still one of the major contributors to our GDP and our export effort. I am extremely proud that I stand here today as the representative of one electorate that produces somewhere between 60 and 70 per cent of Australia's total wheat exports each year. That is something that any member of parliament could be proud of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a long time since Australia had any bad farmers. Unfortunately the events of the last 20 or 30 years have wiped out bad farmers. You have had to have been an extremely good farmer to survive some of the natural and unnatural events, which would be presented by 20 per cent interest rates, the recession you had to have and those sorts of things. To survive all that and still be on the land, you are now a good farmer. Those people still face substantial difficulties, of which this bill sets out to address one aspect, and that is with the farm family restart scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farm family restart scheme would act as a catalyst to assist farmers in assessing their long-term future on the farm, providing professional advice to assist in this process. That is when a farm has got into difficulties. It might be in difficulties, as the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has just pointed out, purely and simply because as time has gone by it has got too small. As I drive around my electorate, I drive through town after town at roughly 50&hyphen;kilometre spacings. They were constructed in that fashion because that was as far as you could go and back in a day with a horse and cart. Today of course, with good roads and high&hyphen;speed vehicles, many of those towns are experiencing difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the early subdivisions were made on the basis of what a farming family could handle with a team of horses. Clearly today much larger properties are required and sometimes their capital value is beyond the resources of the individual that seeks to expand their property. They are not bad farmers, but other circumstances are affecting their viability. This gives them that breathing space. Some are going to survive through that breathing space because they might be simply suffering from other factors and that bit of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9532"> cash to keep their family going as provided through the newstart arrangements is sufficient to get them back on the road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In making a few notes for this particular address, I thought, `What are the enemies of farmers today?' Naturally it has always been the weather. Strangely enough, that is not as bad a thing for many wheat growers, for instance, as it used to be. A farmer in the old days used to get an inch of rain, got out the team of horses and planted literally a few acres a day. Gradually the soil dried out and they had to stop until they got another shower of rain. People in my electorate&mdash;and one whom I can mention who had a property just outside my electorate, the late Senator John Panizza&mdash;have machinery that will plant one acre a minute. Panizza planted about 25,000 acres of wheat a year. The reality is that in using that, and using it 24 hours a day, it is amazing the extent to which a farming business can put a crop in with one shower of rain, be it the one that arrives somewhat late. That is the good side. That is what has happened. The weather is not the problem it used to be. It is still a problem if it does not rain at all, but you can do much better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then I put down `pestilence'. I did the farming industry a great favour this year; I sold my farm. I am sure that I have always brought bad luck to them. Nevertheless, during my period of farm ownership I suffered the second thing, which I call pestilence. That comes in all sorts of ways. A typical grain growing operation is probably spending $30,000 or $40,000 a year just addressing the red earth mite and the various grubs and things that one knows are going to be there every year. I also experienced a year of locusts. I have also experienced a fully&hyphen;fledged cyclone. If you want a nice frightening experience, just stand amongst these things that are bashing you in the face every second as they fly and just watch trees disappear in front of your eyes as the locusts eat every leaf off them. They do not leave you much crop. You cannot spray them down, and you can get them as little fellas. That is the sort of thing that makes it very difficult for a good farmer.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are things called international prices. The Australian agricultural industry is simply a price taker. But those prices are at both ends of the equation. It seems a great peculiarity that, as grain prices go down, many of our imported products&mdash;such as nitrogen based fertilisers and many of the herbicides and insecticides we import from other countries and the machinery that they manufacture that we invented&mdash;do not come down in price. But we often see fluctuations in prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are the two very interesting ones that I put together, and they are interest rates and currency movements. I have to say, as a representative of a rural electorate, I was pleased to hear today that the Australian dollar fell through the 73c barrier. I have always believed that at our stage of international indebtedness it is only worth about 70c anyway. I am pleased to think that the policies of this government economically have seen only a very gradual decline, not the sorts of effects that we are experiencing to our north in some Asian countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality and the link is that, as interest rates decline, your currency declines&mdash;not because you are necessarily running a bad ship, but because those people who deal in bonds and are looking for the best possible margin are simply prepared to pay less for our money if we are paying them less interest for it. That is the reason. When we talk about the Aussie dollar, it is not trading in bundles of hundreds; it is trading in debt instruments. When they attract less interest, the international buyers are paying a lower price. That is how our dollar comes down. But the return to people at home, our manufacturers and our agriculturalists, is improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another interesting thing. The economists will tell you that, as your currency falls, inflation is absolutely certain and the price of a lot of imported items will increase. Strangely enough, they frequently do not. I now argue that there is no such thing as an internationally stable price for a commodity; it is what a particular local market will bear. With all the jostling that goes on these days, the loss is often taken by the exporter to our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9533"> country. So a sensibly lower currency is most important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of those things are what a good farmer struggles with, and they are all totally outside his or her control. When they come together they create great problems that require the sort of treatment we are proposing today&mdash;a short-term, one&hyphen;year proposal which will give them some breathing space but which will ensure that their lifestyle is not less than that that of anybody else who is unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also pleased because as a package it is not promised forever. The part of this package that I am most proud of, and it links in with the other problem, is our new approach to IEDs, or income equalisation deposits. I sincerely hope that future governments of any political colour do not tinker with it. We have seen it in, we have seen it out. We stood here one day when it was thrown out because of a tax scam that had arisen. We did not fix the tax scam. We threw the baby out with the bathwater. We then saw wool prices go through the roof, prices that were created only by borrowing money. We had farmers borrowing money through their wool corporation to buy their own wool and paying tax on the profits. We have seen the outcome of all that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those arrangements have not been helpful. The IED was not there when those people earned all that money. They paid huge taxation and after that they had nothing because the country went into drought, the scheme collapsed, prices collapsed and they were in severe trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has often been said that the best protection against all those things I have just mentioned, and more particularly drought and bad weather, is a haystack of money. The problem that has confronted Australia's farmers has been that whilst the income equalisation deposit, a means of depositing money that was not taxed&mdash;you paid tax on it, if you were taxable, when you used it in hard times&mdash;was on and off, most farmers never got enough surplus money in cash to make use of it. They had to lodge the money in a separate place and they usually found themselves with a potential surplus after two or three bad years when they had borrowed a lot 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of money. The bank, having seen their return to viability, wanted it back. But for every dollar they paid back to the bank they could be up for one or two dollars in taxation, depending on whether they had a responsibility to pay any provisional tax or whatever. Too frequently the tax man got there first. Too frequently there was too little money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new proposals, where you can create your IED with your own financial institution, it is my view that you can go along to them and say: `I have had two bad years. I owe you $100,000. I am going to have a $50,000 disposable surplus in this first good year. I want to put that down as an IED with your bank and offset it against the $100,000 I owe you.' The bank will accept that because they will make a profit on the margin into the bargain. They are satisfied that they have cash guaranteeing cash. But the farmer has reduced his net liability to the bank by 50 per cent because he has not paid any tax on the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go further into that it gets complex but it is an opportunity to start getting yourself back on your feet. It is a very good proposal and it means that over time the very scheme we are proposing today will not be needed. I am the first to say to my farmers that, if we have a proper transition period, all of the hand&hyphen;out propositions&mdash;notwithstanding all the issues I have mentioned that are outside their control&mdash;should cease. If you are given reasonable time to get back on your feet and you access the IED component you should not have to be helped out in bad times. To their credit, they all agree with me. They say: `Yes, that is fair enough.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take the last seven minutes, having mentioned this scheme and said that it is a good scheme and that I support it wholeheartedly as part of the package, to talk a little more about the tax system. The income tax system has always hit farmers very hard because they have a cyclical income arrangement and in very good years their gross revenues are huge. If you are putting in 25,000 acres of wheat a week in country that averages five bags, but one year you get 10 or 12&mdash;and that is the way the average works; in another year you get one or two&mdash;you have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9534"> a huge amount of money. But if the tax man just comes and rips it off you, what do you do in the year you get one or two? You cannot manage. That is why the IED fits that requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we have to look at the rest of the tax system. I welcome the fact that the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), is taking some interest in my speech. I know he has a genuine concern and interest in it. I thank him for that. I hope I can get him to listen to my next little plea without thinking that I am playing politics. Our present indirect tax system is so damaging to anybody who tries to grow anything or make anything. I like to give the example&mdash;because we have had all our disputes&mdash;of payroll tax. Hardly any farmers pay payroll tax directly because the wages they pay are minimal and there is a threshold. Most of them would tell you they have an exemption for sales tax. And they have. But then, I would say in my electorate: `Who pays these taxes?' `No, I don't pay them.' `How did you get to the meeting tonight?' `I came in my car.' They certainly paid sales tax on that car unless they used the one tonne, four wheel drive ute, which is exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is worse than that and it applies to everything on their property. That car is made of iron ore, coal, oil and probably some bauxite, all mined, let us say, because it is a good Aussie vehicle, within Australia. Every one of those mining companies pays payroll tax. Every time the stuff moves between one place and another somebody pays fuel tax and if they are using trucks the sales tax component is substantial&mdash;it is $40,000 on a new prime mover. If you annualise that it is a significant amount per annum. The last time I did the sums as a trucking operator I identified about $2,000 a week of indirect taxes paid by a typical road train&mdash;that is annualising some of the fixed charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the iron ore mine, which is the place where the motor car starts its life, pays payroll tax, the cost accountant says, `That is a cost of doing business out here at the iron ore mine'&mdash;or the coal mine&mdash;`and I will put a profit margin on it before I sell it off to BHP or whoever.' When that stuff gets to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> BHP it has gone across a railway line or something else where similar taxes are being paid and another profit margin is put on the product. BHP pays the payroll tax, and sales tax is so insidious that no&hyphen;one knows when they are paying it&mdash;there are all the computers inside your business and the rubber tyres on the trolley that someone uses in the supermarket. It does not matter where you look; it is so insidious. They add a profit margin to that tax that BHP pays, but they also add a profit margin to the tax and the profit margin that was paid out at the iron ore mine. All we have at this stage is some billets of steel and we have eventually got to turn them into a motorcar. And it continues right until you get to the sales office where the larger car dealers pay payroll tax. And they all build it into the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to drive out on Sunday in the vehicle it is probably not a problem. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> said the other day that if you add it all up it is about $10,000 on a Falcon. They also said that if you reduced even the sales tax component from 22 per cent to 12 per cent, 60,000 additional Aussies could afford a car every year. That would be very good  news in Geelong and Elizabeth. But all these costs are building up for the guy who is running his farm. He pays payroll tax all right&mdash;he pays it hundreds of times, but not directly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we had a barbed wire fence around Australia and ate and used only what we produced, it would not be a problem. But we are in a relatively open competing society and some of these people covered by this do not grow wheat and export it; they grow oranges and have to fight with the Brazilians. We say to the people on the Murray, `You send your orange juice about 700 kilometres to Melbourne or Sydney in a truck'&mdash;that is basically the only way to get it there&mdash;`and we will tax you $2,000 a week a truck load,' while the Brazilians arrive at the back door of Melbourne and Sydney on the cheapest travel in the world, international sea travel, and we say, `Compete with them.' That is silly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to have a tax system that removes the aggregating and the feeding of all those taxes into the price&mdash;not because of what 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9535"> someone pays for the product in the end but because of what it is doing to our car manufacturers, our farmers and everybody else who is just trying to compete with the rest of the world, whether it is at home or abroad. It is now quite clear that we can make a motorcar that is as good a quality car as anybody makes but we put thousands of dollars of lead in the manufacturers' saddlebags through the tax system, as we do to farmers. They cannot carry the burden. And what do we do? We recycle some of the money and give them this sort of assistance. It would be much better to give them a decent tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish we could sit down as 146 people in this place to talk about it without trying to make a political point&mdash;just to see what is the best system. If we did we would go down in history; they would put up statues of all of us. In reality there is a best system and we will only get it if we all get together on the issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of pleasure that I join in this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R324">Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill</XREF> ,  which has commonly become known as the AAA package. I would like to congratulate the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and his former parliamentary secretary, Senator David Brownhill, because I know that they have put a lot of work and time into this and have probably come in for some criticism at times because this was not coming through as quickly as some people might have liked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The origins of it go back some time. The original impetus for this change goes back to about 1989 when the ARMCANZ ministers decided that drought would no longer be a natural disaster. At that particular time the ministerial council said that there needed to be a package brought into place to overcome the problems that might occur having withdrawn the support that was in the old rural assistance scheme. State governments, in particular New South Wales, continued to support the subsidisation of the transport of stock for agistment and the subsidisation of fodder and water. There was some support for farmers through the state schemes for interest rates. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the real issues that needed to be addressed were left in abeyance for some time and it was not until we had the very severe drought, which had most of eastern Australia in its grip during the early 1990s, that the problems associated with withdrawing drought as a natural disaster certainly came to the fore. I recall, as minister for agriculture in New South Wales at the time, approaching Senator Collins, who was the federal primary industries minister, about some action in this particular area and it was certainly discussed at an ARMCANZ meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that we eventually did get some household support, which I and, I think, a lot of rural producers were very appreciative of. It was rural support which meant that at least they could put some food on the table, because they were in such a situation that they did not have any money and were finding it very difficult to exist. We have to understand that these circumstances are going to recur fairly regularly in Australia, because it is the driest inhabited continent on earth and drought is certainly part of the continuing scene as far as regional and rural Australia is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that over the years, as the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has said, there have been some very reasonable and helpful programs in place, even through the taxation system. I recall that a few years ago if a producer did have a good year they could write off the cost of upgrading fences and infrastructure in one year. That was removed. I think it was during the Fraser years that we had an IED scheme, whereby producers in years of good income could put away money and then bring it back into the system when they needed it in poor years, paying tax at that time. That was removed and it became very necessary to look closely at the system to see what could be put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was never a great supporter of the old rural adjustment scheme. I did not believe it had incentives in place to reward good managers and people who were efficient producers. It tended to prop up those who were inefficient. Those who were in trouble through bad management or through not being as progressive as other producers would get 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9536"> the support first, and you would find that some producers who were very efficient and progressive fell just outside the guidelines and were the ones who were disadvantaged. I have always been a very strong supporter of incentive&mdash;of encouraging people to look after themselves, and I believe this farm household support package goes a long way to doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main thing you need to do in these circumstances is to encourage people to conserve fodder, water and money so that they can carry on in the bad years. I believe the package that has been put together attempts to address those issues, to try to encourage those efficient producers to do just that so that they will be able to carry themselves through in most instances&mdash;although we will always get the situation in Australia where you get to what is called an exceptional circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exceptional circumstance is where, through no fault of their own but through the fact that there has been a very poor rainfall pattern or whatever, people do get to the stage where they have used up all their reserves. The trick that has always been difficult has been defining what an exceptional circumstance is in many instances. Anyone who knows the rural areas will tell you that an exceptional circumstance varies right across the whole area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you come from an area such as the one I come from on the north coast of New South Wales, where the rainfall is fairly regular, going without rain for nine or 10 months is pretty much an exceptional circumstance. If you go to the west of New South Wales, to the Broken Hill area, you can probably go 18 months without rain before you start to say that it is an exceptional circumstance. So that was always a very difficult definition and one that I know many people wrestled with. I have always believed that it is something which should be left in the hands of the rural lands protection boards in New South Wales&mdash;there are similar bodies in other states but they have other names. The local people who are genuine and who understand what an exceptional circumstance is are the best people to make that decision.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also looks very carefully at the need to help educate farmers. That is something which is very important today. We do not have to describe again in this House the technological changes which have occurred right throughout the country, whether in farming or industry. Managing a farm today means managing a big business. Units, necessarily, have become bigger, because the only way you can get a reasonable income these days is to have economies of scale. That is something that has occurred in most industries and probably needs to occur further yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By increasing the size of the units, you end up with a large gross income, although not necessarily a large net income. It is very important to keep a very close watch on a business such as that. In days gone by you might draw up a cashbook every 12 months. These days you have to keep a watch on your outgoings at least on a weekly basis and probably even more frequently than that, to make sure that you are on budget and that your expenses are not getting ahead of income. That need for planning and education is a very vital part of farming operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for O'Connor mentioned the tax system and there is no doubt that what he says has a lot of relevance for farming communities&mdash;and, I dare say, for the whole community. The tax system needs to be addressed and this government has certainly made it very clear that it is prepared to have a close look at the tax system in this country, particularly at those taxes which make it more difficult to compete on world markets by adding costs onto goods that we are trying to export to world markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax system we have at the present time can only be highlighted by an experience some years ago when there was a good year and, all of a sudden, an increase in price. Producers were smiling, I dare say, about their luck at getting a doubling in price&mdash;it was one of those windfalls at the time&mdash;until they went along to talk to their accountants. Then they found out that, coming off a very low income base and having this windfall gain, provisional tax was going to take everything they had, if not a bit more.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9537">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what made it so difficult, when people had gone through these times. We must remember that in most areas of Australia, particularly in the grain industry, you get about one season in five, on average. So there are a number of years when you are on a low income, if not a negative income, and you depend on those very good years to upgrade the property or to do something about increasing your property if you are not an efficient unit, and the tax system does make it very hard. So it is not a matter of avoiding tax; I think it is a matter of trying to be a little bit fair and understanding in circumstances such as those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An area that is addressed in this legislation that is important to farmers is the fact that farmers tend to live in family units on farms. That has been a way of life in Australia for a long time, and it is not unusual to see three generations of a family on a farm, usually because the income is low and it is very difficult for the older members of the family to move off the farm. They do not have enough cash to move off the farm; they are more or less trapped there because they cannot break away from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something else that occurs which is rather unique is that the younger generations tend to work on those properties for much less than wages&mdash;in some instances, just for keep&mdash;with the understanding that the property might be passed on to them when the older generations pass away. That trap is one of the things that this government has recognised and is trying to overcome in this particular legislation, which will allow the older members of the family to at least get a pension&mdash;they will not be denied that&mdash;and allow the younger generations to take over the workings of the farm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard it said today that this seems to be some great concession to the farming community. I do not believe it is. I think that the family farm in Australia has served this country very well and, if you look very carefully at it, you will find that most farmers&mdash;I do not say all farmers&mdash;over their lifetimes would average less than the basic wage if you average the income that they earn over the years. It is a way of life more than 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a business, and I think that the concessions that we give them are certainly not outrageous and certainly not more than you might expect other sections of the community to get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overall package has been well thought through. It has looked at most areas where there have been some problems in the farming community. I believe that the incentives have been put in place, there is education available and there is the ability to get refinancing. Those types of packages are vital to the rural community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know my area is very gratified that the older members of the family can get some support. Coming from the North Coast of New South Wales, the units in that particular area are not large, and I think there is need for upgrading. There is no doubt that they need to be upgraded, and this will give them some chance of doing that and becoming economically viable units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I would like to congratulate the minister and the parliamentary secretary. I know that they put a lot of work into this, they have consulted widely and they should be congratulated on the package that they have come up with. I know very well that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has strongly supported this particular package, and that only goes to show again his support for the regional areas of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly a pleasure for me to speak on this <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R324">Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill 1997</XREF> . This bill is just part of an overall package for the rural sector, the Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very honoured to be part of the launch of that package on 14 September in my electorate. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) launched this very innovative package at Hoskinstown, not 30 minutes from Canberra but a very rural farming district, in my electorate of Eden&hyphen;Monaro.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package was launched on the property of Greg and Mary Walsh, and it has received enormous accolades right across the board. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9538"> The accolades have come not from people who are on the fringes&mdash;and a lot of people have been commenting from various fringes&mdash;but from people who understand just what it has been like in parts of rural Australia over the last half&hyphen;a&hyphen;dozen years or so. We really have had some exceptional circumstances in many parts of rural Australia in recent years. The accolades have come from the sorts of people who should know and the sorts of people who were very much involved in the development of the package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package is not something that the government threw together in five minutes; it was developed, quite properly, over a long period of time because it is a very important package for the future of our rural industries. It was done with an enormous amount of consultation with relevant bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who commented following the launch include the vice&hyphen;president of the National Farmers Federation, Ian  Donges, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Integrated Rural Policy Package was a well balanced series of measures which would set the framework for self reliance in Australia's rural industries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Farm Family Restart Scheme&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which we are dealing with here in this bill&mdash;</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There were also comments from other people in the industries. Queensland Farmers Federation President, Lex Buchanan, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is good to see there will be a smooth transition of drought aid programmes and that people are not going to be dropped over the edge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Queensland Grain Growers Association President, Ian MacFarlane, who has not exactly been an enormous out&hyphen;there and up&hyphen;front advocate for some of the areas that government have been working in recent years&mdash;I think he is often unfairly critical out of his depth&mdash;in this particular case made the comment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We now have a far better plan in place to provide tax incentives for farmers to put aside money in good years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's also good to see that farmers handing their property on to the next generation will now be able to access social security.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The United Graziers Association President, Larry Acton, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a good balance between tax relief, training and social assistance and I am very positive about the package.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Harry Bonanno from the Queensland cane growers said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is good to see a broadening of criteria for access to exceptional circumstance payments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are many more. The overall package was well received and for good reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at how this particular farm household support amendment bill is made up, it typifies the overall philosophy that we were putting into this new package. There was really a deep&hyphen;seated philosophy of putting in place assistance and other programs to ensure that rural communities are able to help themselves in the future and can try to get away from the welfare handout mentality which was starting to creep in over the last decade. That started because of the sorts of policies that were in place and the lack of the types of policies that we have included in this AAA package. It is a basic philosophy in which we differ from the other side of politics. We are also implementing some of those changes in the education and training area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is putting the emphasis back at what I would call the sharp end so that we will be helping farmers to be better trained, increase 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9539"> their skills and prepare themselves for those difficult years well in advance, rather than waiting for them to fall into difficulty and making them go through years of difficulty, as the former Labor government did in the late 1980s and early 1990s when they did not provide any relief at all. When it got to absolute desperation you threw out a few bones to try to help them along. That builds up a culture of, `We will just mosey along and do what we can and, hopefully, if we get into trouble the government will come along and help us out.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our whole philosophy is very different and when you add to that many of the other economic changes that we have made since we have come to government, which have seen interest rates drop 2.5 per cent at least over the last 12 months, these have been of enormous benefit to most farmers. Most farmers, I would say, are travelling on fairly large debts and they have pretty big overdrafts. Even though those business overdrafts and debts are still running at interest rates that are too high, they have come down at least 2.5 per cent in the last 12 to 15 months and that has had a big impact on the farming community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are putting emphasis also on opening up markets. Since we have come to government, we have opened up markets in a whole variety of new areas throughout the world, and many farming groups are benefiting from that. That is one aspect of it in the overall picture which cannot be forgotten when you look at these sorts of initiatives within the Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia policy. We compare that with the former government which really has, as I said, this total welfare dependency attitude. I gave that example of the late 1980s and early 1990s. I am sure many farmers will never forget that they went through hell for many years during a very difficult drought and got no assistance at all until the situation was absolutely desperate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill itself covers a whole variety of areas. It basically allows for income support to be paid at the newstart allowance rate, and this payment will be available for a maximum period of 12 months. The recipients of that payment will not have to satisfy any activity 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> test; also, quite importantly, they will not have to put their farm on the market to get that assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition spokesperson for primary industries, in speaking to this bill earlier, made a big song and dance about that. He said, `Well, really, no farmers should go into this thinking that they won't have to put their farm on the market; they really will.' Once again, that is the sort of approach that those on the other side of politics seem to make&mdash;they get great joy in throwing in those little scare comments every now and again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, we have put this particular provision in for a specific reason because, if you go on to the next part of the bill&mdash;and that is that the recipients will have a binding obligation to obtain professional advice on the future viability of their businesses&mdash;what we are saying is, `Okay, you're in difficulty. We're going to help you get the right sort of advice. You don't have to put your farm on the market straightaway, you can get assistance, but let's work through the advice and see what can be done and see whether we can work out a way in which you can either trade your way out of the problems or whether the better idea is to move on, to move off the farm if it is not viable.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is an expectation that we are going to look at the very positive side of it, before people get to the negative side of it and say, `Well, we'll have to give away the farm.' That is the reason why we have included that in there&mdash;so that they do not have to put the farm on the market in the first instance. We want people to work through this with professional help to see whether a good result can be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another part of the legislation is access to a re-establishment grant of up to $45,000 on the sale of the farm. This will only be available to farmers who enter the scheme during its first two years of operation. We are saying that there is a window of opportunity there. We know there are many farms out there that are not viable; they really are too small in the current climate and for the types of markets we are dealing in. We are giving people an opportunity to say, `Well, this isn't going to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9540"> work. We can get help in this way and we can start afresh.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The value of any income support used by the recipient will be deducted from that re-establishment grant. I think that is fair. We are looking after taxpayer money, and we have to make sure that we use it in the most efficient way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The re-establishment grant is subject to an assets test. Farmers will be able to have up to $90,000 in assets and still be able to qualify for the maximum grant. That is a significant change in comparison with what was there before&mdash;the farm household support scheme. Once again, the opposition spokesperson on primary industries has said that all we have done is picked up their policy and tinkered around the edges. The previous scheme was an abject failure. For instance, in the year 1995-96 the number of families that were supported under that scheme was less than 50. It was terminated in May 1997 and is now being replaced by this new package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in this new package there are some quite specific differences from that former policy. I have mentioned already that farmers will not have to put their farm on the market to gain assistance. It is a major difference; it is not tinkering around the edges. We have increased the amount of assets they can have from $45,000 to $90,000. That is a doubling of it&mdash;I do not think that is tinkering around the edges. Some of those opposite might think that $45,000 is not very much, but it is an enormous amount on a lot of the farming properties these days. We really have made some dramatic changes and put together a package which is far better focused for the needs of rural Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of the bill is that the `drought exceptional circumstances payment' will become an `exceptional circumstances payment'. I just want to speak briefly in support of that. We have discovered over the last few years that, sure, you can have droughts and you can put up all sorts of statistics, such as the detail of annual rainfall taken over many years, if you have that information. I have to say that in many parts of New South Wales, and particularly my area, the New South Wales government's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> statistical information in that regard is very poor and, because only that very poor data is available, it makes life very difficult to prove certain instances. You can have drought, but you can also have all sorts of other things happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent) spoke earlier in this debate and described the exceptional circumstances that occurred in his electorate in a very short period of time. It could not be shown as a drought exceptional circumstance, even though it was an exceptional circumstance. Therefore, I think this change we are making is very valid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That certainly applies in a part of my electorate: the Monaro. It is quite a unique part of the country where they have been in drought for the last four to five years. Because of the way in which rain has fallen in those four years, you cannot justify a drought exceptional circumstance claim, but everybody will accept that there really has been an exceptional circumstance occur. That is because several other things have been happening. You have had plagues of wingless grasshoppers; you have had real failure of grazing pastures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Monday of last week I was down there with a member of the minister's office and an agronomist, looking at the trial of a variety of pastures that was undertaken in a few places in this area near Cooma. To see what has occurred in that three- or four-year period is quite incredible, and you can understand why they have had the difficulty they have had. In a controlled area where nothing has been able to get at these pastures, you have had complete failure of some native pastures that would normally flourish. There really has been a quite exceptional circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An application, in fact, was lodged for that area quite some months ago. The New South Wales government took from May through to August to deal with that and, unfortunately, through much bureaucratic hold-up and other things, although the application was for exceptional circumstances, they then asked the Commonwealth to assess it on drought exceptional circumstances&mdash;and for what reason, we do not know. We then had to point that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9541"> out. Finally, a couple of weeks later, they said, `Yes, all right, you can look at it from an exceptional circumstance point of view.' That has been done. The RASAC committee visited there several weeks ago. As I have said, I visited there last Monday with a member of the minister's staff, and I understand that we are getting close to receiving a report from RASAC so that the minister will be in a position to make a decision about that particular application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that application highlights a variety of things, particularly the incredible circumstances that can occur in an area over several years. Also it raises the other issue of the viability of farms and the size of farm holdings in particular areas. I think that is an aspect that will have to be looked at more closely in that region, because many of the problems that have been created do stem to some extent from the size of properties and viability as circumstances have changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, this bill is a very positive step forward and part of an incredibly positive, integrated rural policy of which we will be seeing other aspects introduced in the coming months. I, and certainly my constituents in the largely rural part of my electorate, will be looking forward to those. They include the training areas and the farm business areas and those sorts of things. These particular measures in the farm household support legislation are real safety net measures. We are talking about safety nets but at the same time allowing people to work things through in a way which can be positive for the future and for their future generations on that farm.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, it is good to see you in the chair for the first time when I have been speaking. I do have a number of farms in my electorate of Dickson, but as a result of the redistribution there will be another 400 square kilometres added to the seat of Dickson. The Labor Party should bear that in mind when they are trumpeting their newfound heroine around the seat of Dickson. There are a lot of farmers who have had a lot of tough times in the past who will be added to the electorate of Dickson when that additional 400 square kilometres is added. In fact, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the boundaries are going to be moved from Cobbold Creek right through to the Pine Rivers Shire boundaries that extend almost to Mount Mee. It will include areas like Dayboro, Lacey's Creek and Mount Pleasant, which are beautiful areas of the Samford Valley and other stretches of the Pine Rivers Shire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has not escaped my attention that those additional farms will form part of the extended electorate of Dickson. Let us hope that the electors in that part of the new electorate of Dickson will remember that the previous government did little, if anything, to assist people on the land and in fact regarded them always as people who did not need assistance in times of strife and trouble. It has been sad to notice, even in my own area of Mount Samson, that, as a result of a long and continuing drought and other matters, farms have closed down in recent times. I am speaking about the last 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a gradual decline in the dairy farming output in the area and in particular in my own street, Kundes Road, Mount Samson, the last dairy farm closed down in the last six months. That street used to have dairy farms right throughout the street. It is only a short street by rural standards but it was dotted with dairy farms all the way along. That particular farm has closed its dairying operations and that is a sad thing in many respects. But it is understandable because a number of problems have given rise to that, not the least being the prolonged and continuing drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The adjacent farm to my property, which was also a dairy farm, closed something like three years ago because of a number of factors, including drought. The farmers concerned, the Schmidt family, have now diversified to running an emu farm and tourist facility. Although it has not been easy, it does show the initiative of John and Betty Schmidt, who have taken on board the fact that the climate has changed and the rural environment has changed, and they have moved into the area of emu farming, together with their tourist facility. They do cook some mean emu steaks on that farm of theirs now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have tried them and they are not too bad. I would not have them every Saturday night, though. Nonetheless, they are not a bad steak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem of drought is something that I am sure rural people understand. I know, having lived off the land myself as a farmer, which is a very difficult life, that the moment it does rain the tendency is to forget that there is going to be another drought. That is the inevitable cycle. Unfortunately, what has happened in recent years is that there has been prolonged drought. Indeed, it is fair to say that in that area, the Samford Valley and the surrounds, there has been, I would say, a prolonged drought since 1988. The prolongation of that drought unfortunately has caused a lot of farms to become unviable. Sadly, people have moved out of the area and farming in the area has given way to small hobby farm blocks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the farmers in the area who have been successful have, of course, made allowances for the fact of drought. The pineapple farmers in particular, though they do not need the same rainfall that other farmers do, certainly have made a continuing go of their operations. The Henzell farm, which is just next to my mother's property, is a successful operation, and the farming operation stretches also into Dayboro.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that farmers bear in mind the notion that, even in an area like that, which is not terribly far from the coast&mdash;indeed, it is probably only a 35-minute drive to the coast from my place&mdash;drought is part of the cycle, and worse so in the more marginal areas of the countryside. Many farmers make provision for that, but other farmers unfortunately have fallen into the trap of believing that, once that rain comes and the green grass is growing, things will be right, and they do not make provision for the cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a continuous drought in that area for a number of years now. Although it has been alleviated at times with some rainfall, generally the rain has been dumped on the area. There has been a major failure of wet season rains. Consequently, the illusory green is quickly replaced by the depressing brown. There is nothing more depressing than 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> continuous drought in that area, as in every other area of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why these measures have been very well received, not only in my electorate but right throughout Australia. That was outlined by the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn) in his speech to this House immediately before mine. I do not wish to canvass in any great detail many of the things he said. He comes from a much more concentrated rural electorate, naturally enough, and obviously has a very good understanding of the needs of his constituents in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to refer to a couple of elements of this scheme. The farm family restart scheme will act as a catalyst to assist farmers in assessing their long-term future on the farm and provides professional advice to assist in the process. It is not a loan scheme. All support will be provided as a grant, unlike the old farm household support scheme. Income support will be paid at newstart allowance rates, as will the partner component where applicable, and it will be available for a maximum period of one year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farm family restart scheme&mdash;FFRS&mdash;recipients will not have to satisfy an activity test and will not have to put the farm on the market to obtain assistance. The FFRS provides a higher asset limit and a tapered phase-out of the grant to encourage farmers to leave before their assets are severely depleted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the old rural adjustment scheme, a farmer could walk away with a maximum $90,000&mdash;$45,000 in grants and $45,000 in assets. Under the FFRS, a farmer can walk away with a maximum of $135,000&mdash;an increased asset limit of $90,000, plus a grant of $45,000&mdash;without affecting the grant. For assets over $90,000, the grant reduces by $2 for every $3 in assets. No grant will be payable over $157,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To qualify for the scheme, you must be a farmer of at least 18 years of age; you must be an Australian resident in Australia; you must have been a farmer for a continuous period of two years before you apply; and you must have a certificate of inability to obtain finance. All people receiving restart income support have an obligation to obtain advice on the long-term prospects for their farm busi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9543"> ness and on their future options if they decide to leave the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 42 enables the secretary to direct the recipient to obtain certain advice and to assist the person in paying for the advice. That is an important aspect, which touches on what I said before about the need for farmers to be realistic. Sometimes it is very hard to be realistic when there is so much hanging on a farming property, particularly if there has been longevity of family tenure on that farm. There is an enormous amount that is bound up in a farming property. It is not just the work that has been done on that property over many years; it is the generational attachment to the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am the last speaker on this matter and will wind up now. All of these measures demonstrate the coalition's commitment to the rural areas and to the increasing sensitivity of this government to rural considerations and needs. It demonstrates that the farmers of the electorate of Dickson, particularly in the expanded Dickson, will receive excellent service while they retain a member of the coalition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;There are a few points I want to make in summing up. I first go to those who have spoken on the package, and I thank them very much for their contribution. I want to make some observations about the opposition's position on this. Their spokesman seems to believe that Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia is little more than a tinkering at the edges of the former Labor government's rural policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That simply is not true. At the very least, one need only look at the amount in the forward estimates for the old rural assistance scheme and compare it to the very much enhanced quantities of money being made available for this package to recognise that it is far more than simply a tinkering at the edges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that, the policy includes several major elements which were beyond the scope of the former Labor government to deliver. I could refer specifically, for example, to the three&hyphen;year waiver of the gifting provisions that will allow many older farmers to gain access 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the age pension and pass on the farm to the next generation. I could also refer to the introduction of a new commercially operated farm management deposit scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I also need to point out that I have been prepared to give credit where credit is due. I understand that there was a charge to the effect that I had not been. I have, for example, on a number of occasions publicly acknowledged that the drought relief payment arrangements introduced by the previous government were a very important initiative in ensuring the survival of many farm families during the worst drought this century. I trust that the opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), would be gracious enough to acknowledge that we have improved further upon that scheme&mdash;for example, in doubling the recovery period and in allowing for greater recognition of the effectiveness of rainfall in drought circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summing up, the new schemes, which will be established by these amendments to the Farm Household Support Act, represent a significant improvement in the access that farm families have to welfare assistance during times of hardship. They will also play an important role in farm adjustment. In both these respects, the new farm family restart scheme and the exceptional circumstances relief payment are important ingredients in a forward looking policy mix for Australia's vital farm sector. They are the first of several new initiatives to be implemented under the federal government's Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia package, which I am pleased to say has been widely welcomed by rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's objective through Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia and other initiatives such as the Natural Heritage Trust and supermarket to Asia is to boost the profitability, productivity, competitiveness and sustainability of the farm sector working in partnership with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farm family restart scheme will begin operating on 1 December 1997 and will be available to low income farmers who are experiencing financial hardship and cannot borrow further against their assets. Recipients will need to satisfy income and off&hyphen;farm 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9544"> assets tests and demonstrate that they are unable to borrow further against their assets. The farm family restart scheme will provide these farm families with access to income support at the same rate as the newstart allowance, with an additional partner component if applicable, payable for one year, without recipients having to satisfy an activity test or put their farm on the market. The scheme will also operate as a decision support system for farm families facing hardship and who are contemplating the very difficult question of whether they have a future in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great benefit of the income support payment is that it will remove the pressure of worrying about how farm families are going to meet their day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day living expenses. Recipients will also be required to obtain financial, business, career and personal support paid for by the government to assist them assess the viability of their businesses and their long-term prospects in the industry. For those who choose to leave the industry and have net assets of $90,000 or less, the government will be offering re&hyphen;establishment grants of $45,000, less the value of any income support received under the scheme. The grant reduces by $2 for each $3 of assets and will be available only to those farm families which apply for it during the first two years of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farm family restart scheme will provide the farm sector with an effective welfare safety net, as will the new exceptional circumstances relief payment, when the difficulties faced by farmers are more widespread. The exceptional circumstances relief payment gives recognition to the fact that there are exceptional circumstances which are beyond the scope of normal farm risk management. The ECRP will be available to farmers suffering hardship as a result of rare and severe events, not just exceptional drought. It will  replace the current drought relief payment. Very importantly, it will be no different to the drought relief payment. The ECRP will be an income support payment equivalent to the newstart allowance. It will be subject to an income test and off-farm assets test and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> qualifies farm families for access to health care cards and family payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The duration of the ECRP will be determined on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis according to the exceptional circumstances involved, as is the situation for current exceptional circumstances arrangements under the rural adjustment scheme. A 12&hyphen;month recovery period will continue to apply in the case of drought exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farm family restart scheme and the exceptional circumstances relief payment represent significant positive new policy developments for the farm sector, and I commend them to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Particularly Norah Head, as the member for Dobell mentions. Last Monday week I witnessed a spectacle I had never seen in my life before when some 150 people in their higher age years were seen pushing their tripods and walkers down the street, with placards they had written themselves above their heads and which staff from the Legacy Hostel and the Vietnam Veterans Hostel had prepared. They had the main road of Toukley closed. They marched down the main road of Toukley and around the corner, hobbling and shuffling along, taking up the full width of the roadway, demonstrating their protest and their fierce objections to what is being done to aged people, people who are at the most vulnerable stage of their life in respect of nursing home care in this country. I have never seen the like of it before in my life. I am so proud of those Australians, those men and women. They marched and shuffled down the street expressing their objections to the treatment that is now been accorded them. It was heartless, callous and ruthless.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we go to the other end of the age spectrum&mdash;child care. It was said to me a long time ago in this life that you cost a lot of money when you arrive and you cost a lot of money when you leave. Obviously, the government's withdrawal of some $500 million in capital funding from aged care services has affected one end of the age spectrum. Here the savage reductions of $820 million from child care over two budgets by this government replicates the action they are taking in respect of aged Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our second reading amendment, that I speak in support of as well as I can, refers to the fact that we have not declined to give the bill a second reading but, first, we condemn the government for its cuts of $820 million to child care over two budgets leading to fee increases of up to $20 per child per week, lower quality child care, the closure of services, and job losses&mdash;changes that are forcing some people to stop working and to take their children out of child care or to rely on backyard care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it says the House deplores the government's lack of consultation with the child&hyphen;care industry about implementation of the legislation and its failure to provide adequate information about regulations and guidelines to be made under the act. Thirdly, it calls on the government to reverse its unfair decisions to cap child&hyphen;care assistance at 50 hours and to limit emergency child&hyphen;care assistance to four weeks in any 12&hyphen;month period. Fourthly, it condemns this government's attempts to rush this legislation through to implement its far&hyphen;reaching changes by 1 January 1998, which will cause chaos in the child&hyphen;care sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The background to this legislation is that it comes directly from our Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The Prime Minister's vision of the future is his memory of the past. He marches forward fiercely gazing backwards, trying to recreate the Australia of the 1950s&mdash;trying to get women back into the kitchen and out of the work force. That is one of the direct effects of this legislation. We have seen it in the number of women who have been drop 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9546"> ping out of the work force because they cannot afford now to pay for child&hyphen;care services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, that is reflected in the participation rate. The participation rate goes down and so they look to reduce the unemployment rate by reducing the participation rate&mdash;or the proportion of people of working age looking for work or in work. If one reduces the participation rate and holds the number of jobs constant, then the unemployment rate goes down. But it is a cruel, negative approach to the problems this government has created of job insecurity and lack of confidence in the future&mdash;at both ends, child care and aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I looked at what is happening in my own electorate of Shortland at the northern end, Lake Macquarie. In the Lake Macquarie City Council area the impact has already been quite severe. I want to turn to a report that has been prepared by the council's own officers in respect of child care. It says that it has initiated nine long day care centres, one occasional care centre and a number of outside school hours services.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That council alone administers services that cater for some 600 children per week. But the restructuring by this government of child&hyphen;care assistance arrangements changes the face of children's services throughout the country with a move towards provision of private services. What the council officers are referring to here is the impact that it is going to have upon the services provided within our council area of Lake Macquarie. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 5 to 14 age group has a 4% growth which is well above the State growth of 1%. A number of small outside school hours services in the area only just maintain a viable service at the moment. With the withdrawal of operational funding in January 1998 many will not be able to sustain their service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact of the changes outlined in the Budget leaves Child Care Centres and Outside School Hours Services in a position of uncertainty in terms of their viability.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As we read through all of the report that was prepared and submitted to council, we see the quite damaging impact that it is going to have come January 1998, which I understand is now being extended to April, and also the damage it has already caused as a result of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the abolition of the subsidy for community day care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before this government came into power, it gave an undertaking that it had no plans whatsoever to change the operational subsidy of the community based long day care centre. That was the undertaking it gave. That was the promise it gave. Yet, in its very first budget, in 1996&hyphen;97, operational subsidies for community based long day care centres were abolished. That pushed fees up. That has caused a drop in attendance at child&hyphen;care centres, and that has affected the viability of a number of community based child&hyphen;care centres in my electorate and it has affected the lifestyle and the income of families as well because of the flow&hyphen;on effect of the mother not being able to take work, not being able to afford to work. The effect of child&hyphen;care cuts is that full child care is unaffordable for a large number of low income families. They are the people who are most affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister seems to think that women go to work by choice. Some women pursue careers and do go to work by choice, but a large number of women&mdash;certainly in my electorate&mdash;work because the family needs the additional income. The household needs the additional income. It is supplementary to the husband's income. Most parents have to cut the present number of days they are sending their children to accredited child&hyphen;care centres and then on the other days they are trying to find alternative minders. If they cannot do that through the extended family, if they have an extended family, then there is the risk of backyard child&hyphen;care services being used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, with its ruthless action in respect of child care, is taking away the reassurance that the parent had that their child was in a safe care environment whilst the child was away from the parent, whilst the parent was at work or doing whatever else they had to do. Child&hyphen;care centres are being forced to restructure. The cutbacks affect the proprietors of those child&hyphen;care centres. They affect the staff members as well as the parents; and that adds to insecurity. It is more difficult for families where more than one child attends the centre. Those people have to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9547"> pay an extra $40 each per week for each child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fees have gone up by $4 per day, and this is the lowest increase, which still means that centres have to cut staff some days. What most proprietors in my electorate are saying is that the uncertainty that they are experiencing now has never been felt before. This uncertainty is causing an overload of misinformation on price fixing and other possible changes which this government is planning on bringing in. At the base of it, this action by the government&mdash;this destabilisation of families&mdash;is bringing insecurity and uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One quality child&hyphen;care provider has told us that they are pricing themselves out of providing a high quality of service; a standard of service of which they have always been proud. That, in effect, reduces the standards. They have had to reduce their standards because they have had to reduce staff numbers. They have always had a long waiting list, but that is now changing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One parent who could not afford to pay for a full week's child care has had to reduce it to three days per week and send her child elsewhere for the other two days. Her child had been attending the same centre for a couple of years. This change has meant anxiety for the child as well as the mother. The mother says that she has a feeling of guilt not only for the child but also for the centre in which she has always had a lot of confidence. She knew that her child was happy and being well looked after. We are seeing money being stripped from the care of children. For this government, quality care of children is clearly not a priority. A similar case can be made with respect to aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most child&hyphen;care centres are run by community based parents, not big corporations who can afford big overheads. The priorities in the child&hyphen;care system should be affordability, quality of care, safety and a healthy environment for the children. By cutting funding for these much needed services, the government are sending a message to the community that they do not consider our children's safety and welfare a priority. Children in those child-care centres who have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been used to attending such centres are not only being disrupted and denied care; their progress is also being destabilised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By cutting funding for these much needed services, the government are sending a message to the community that they do not consider our children's safety and welfare a priority. As I said earlier, like our elderly citizens, our children cannot stand up for themselves and speak out as strongly as others in the community can in defence of their priorities. This, therefore, makes them an easy target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Insecurity in our community is now endemic. There is job insecurity, a fear of losing jobs, and a fear of not retaining access to services. What is most hurtful of all is that the government promised to maintain child care and aged care. This government has broken so many of the promises it has made. The total result has been destabilisation and the generation of enormous feelings of anxiety, insecurity and fear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We branded 1 July 1997 as a black day for child care; a national day of action; a day to register in the public mind what this government was doing; a day to raise awareness of the drastic cuts being made by this government in the 1996-97 and 1997&hyphen;98 budgets. In the 1996-97 budget, the cuts amounted to over $500 million. A further $345 million was cut from child care in this budget. But the bulk of the cuts in this budget come from limiting the number of new private long day care places to only 7,000 per year in 1998 and 1999 at a saving of $207 million. Some $81 million was slashed from child-care assistance for non work related care. From 1 January 1998, this is being limited to 20 hours per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that an average 30 places in before and after school care services will lose $18,000 per annum. This will have to be recouped through increased fees if the services are to remain open. In my electorate of Shortland&mdash;both on the Central Coast, from Toukley to Norah Head north, and in the northern end&mdash;the provision of child&hyphen;care services by both the Wyong Shire Council and the Lake Macquarie City Council is

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very difficult to get the message across to members of the government. With ministers, it is impossible, but some backbenchers have some understanding of the harm that is being done. They pretend that it is not happening, but they know that it is because they are getting the same responses in their electorates that we are getting: public anger and family destabilisation of the services that are being provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment we have moved in respect of this bill is intended to drive home to the parliament the damage being caused by this government in its budgetary approach to child care. The government has failed to consult with the child&hyphen;care industry about implementation of the legislation.

<PARA STYLE="Para">In supporting the opposition's second reading amendment, I think the value of point 4 of the opposition's amendment has been clearly recognised already by the government in the changes that were announced by the minister yesterday. Just to place on record those changes as we understand them, I refer to an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  this morning. It said `Child care changes delayed'. I will read the article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has deferred changes to child-care payment arrangements until after Easter next year, prompting concerns by children's groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's new service agency, Centrelink, was to have taken over responsibility for the payments from the Department of Social Security from January 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the Minister for Family Services, Mr Smith, said the handover would now be left until April 27, to enable more detailed consideration of the new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, the article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The national convener of the National Association of Community&hyphen;Based Children's Services, Ms Lynne Wannan, said she doubted&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">even at this point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Centrelink would be ready to take over by April.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It's just all chaos. All the fuss that's going on with aged care will be going on with child care very soon."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a clear indication that even at this point the government is not into position to implement its new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Speaking on the legislation itself, the Commonwealth government's involvement in child care commenced in the early 1970s with the introduction of the Child Care Act by the McMahon government. I always like to recognise progressive legislation, irrespective of what side of the parliament introduces it. In hindsight, the McMahon government's legislation was a very foresighted piece of legislation. It certainly showed a lot of vision in relation to the numbers of women who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9549"> have entered the work force over that period. Over time the needs of working families have increased, women's desires to balance a career and raise a family have increased and the second partner in low income families has found it economically essential to seek either part-time or full-time work. This meant that family day care, occasional care, out of school hours care and preschool care have been either introduced or expanded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major budget cutting decisions in the 1996 budget was to remove the operational subsidy. It was estimated that this move would save the Commonwealth $35.1 million in 1997&hyphen;98, $40.5 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and $41.7 million in 1999 to the year 2000. At this stage I will refer to parts of an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 26 July 1997 by Adele Horan which was based on comments from the Network of Community Activities, which represents before and after school and vacation care providers. These are the important quotes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government's allocation of more than $12 million over two years for consultants to out&hyphen;of&hyphen;school care programs and for minor upgrading is a "scandalous" waste of money, the NSW peak body says.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Network of Community Activities, which represents 600 providers of before and after school and vacation care, has written to the Minister for Family Services, Ms Moylan, urging her to reconsider the decision on consultants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the latest budget, the government announced sweeping changes to its funding of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Individual services will lose operational subsidies of between $24,000 and $41,000, but each will be eligible for a $3,000 government grant to pay a consultant.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article also noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Network's co&hyphen;ordinator, Ms Judy Finlayson, said it was scandalous that the money could not be used in a more cost&hyphen;effective, collaborative way.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It clearly indicates the government is wasting money on consultants while at the same time cutting funding for genuine child&hyphen;care services. These reductions will have a considerable impact on working&hyphen;class families in electorates such as Greenway where harsh economic circumstances are already causing family breakdowns. Affordable child&hyphen;care services run by local councils and community 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and church organisations are in great demand in western Sydney. I quote from correspondence from one such organisation who have sought my support for special funding for their family service project:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quakers Hill Family Services is another project which operates from the complex providing family support, family counselling, multicultural programs and vocational care. This project is jointly sponsored by the Quakers Hill United Church parish and Wesley Mission's Dalmar Child and Family Care. Of the families currently utilising the premises, many are registered child at risk families, and over 70% are dealing with current or recent domestic violence issues. This area also has a high level of non-English speaking families (approx. 25%) many of whom are newly arrived migrants with minimal English skills. In seeking to provide a one&hyphen;stop shop to the high need/vulnerable families, it is essential that this centre is granted child care assistance in order to service these very needy families who have very limited financial and social resources. This would then enable the centre to provide a specialised child care program to begin to address the impact the violence and abuse has had on their children's lives.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The 1996&hyphen;97 budget cuts are either forcing women out of work or forcing families to accept second&hyphen;rate child care options. These options range from reducing the number of child&hyphen;care days used each week, children being left unattended before and after school, older children being asked to look after younger children and neighbours and other family members being used as baby-sitters. While this may appear on the surface to be an ideal arrangement, in many cases reported to me this involves one of the parents travelling considerable distances to transport a child to a grandparent's home, adding to the stress of all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition fails to understand that they cannot reverse a trend by the McMahon government 20 years ago without causing massive social disruption. Increased unemployment, drugs, crime and divorce have led to a breakdown in the family structure. This government's cuts to child-care funding will only add to these problems. A survey conducted by the Australian Services Union found that 71 per cent of 21 councils surveyed in Melbourne had increased child-care fees or plan to do so. In my own local government area, child-care fees were in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9550"> creased by $21.50 per week, or $4.30 per day, because of the removal of the operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example of the increased cost of child care relates to a single parent who came into my office who is going to TAFE to improve her employment skills. Her child-care bill has increased by over $36 since May this year. To clarify this figure, which comes in two parts, firstly, as a result of changes to the child-care assistance the child-care fee for this parent went up from $28 per week to $43 per week, an increase of $15 per week, from 26 May this year. Secondly, as a result of the removal of the operational subsidy, which took effect from 1 July, her fee per week for one child went up from $43 per week to $64 per week. This is an increase over that period of some $36.40, which is outrageous. It is impossible for people in the circumstances that I am describing to keep their children in child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received phone calls and requests for interviews from distressed parents who are being forced to reduce the number of days they use child-care facilities and use the other options that I have previously referred to. These parents are being asked to accept a decrease in income or a change of lifestyle to cope with the Howard government's budget changes. One of the things that will continue to haunt this government is this most peculiar quote from the previous minister during the second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill embodies the government's commitment to assist families with dependent children to participate in the work force and to assist the community by ensuring that child care is affordable for low and middle income families and by improving access to quality child care.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What an appalling mismatch of words and outcomes. Rather than enabling families to participate in the work force, these very actions are reducing participation. Rather than ensuring that child care is affordable, these very actions have caused increases in fees, thus making it less affordable. Rather than ensuring and improving access to quality child care, these very actions are making it less accessible and in time will surely lead to a lowering of quality.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child-care centres are trying to trim what little icing is left in their groups to try to save money and make what is left spread even further across the cake. The overworked staff are all working closely with their client parents, trying desperately to maintain their services and their quality. Nothing could be further from the truth than that espoused by the previous minister. People in reality land know that what she has created is increased trauma, stress and concern. The need to cut back on work time so as to pay less child care is lowering the quality of life of low and middle income earners. So much for the concern for the battlers. It seems more like an attack by an uncaring economic rationalist minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my appropriation speech on 4 June this year I referred to the excellent record of the previous Labor government in providing child-care places for people in western Sydney.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take great pride, as I have on many other occasions, in repeating these remarks. I am glad that the member for Mitchell has made some comments because he would know that what I am saying is correct. His electorate is in a similar part of western Sydney to mine. What I did say on that occasion, which I am very happy to repeat on this occasion, is that under the previous Labor government the Blacktown local government area was approved as a high need area for new community based long day care places and outside school hour places. Under Labor, western Sydney had 361 places for every 1,000 children compared with the New South Wales average of 326 places per 1,000. Blacktown also had the highest relative level of long day care supply in western Sydney. Under Labor, the availability and the affordability of child-care facilities increased considerably.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This good work has been undone by this government in just two budgets. The increase in child-care places under Labor in response to the rate of female participation in the work force, which increased from 40.6 per cent in 1972 to 53.4 per cent in 1996, has been particularly high in the 25- to 59-year-old 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9551"> group. My own electorate contains a large, fast growing residential area where two&hyphen;income families reside and into which many young families are moving. There is, therefore, an urgent need for family support services, particularly child care, to allow both parents, if the economic need is there, to take part in either full-time or part-time work so that the family budget can be balanced. This view is supported by Sheryle Bagwell in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 21 May of this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access to quality child-care is extremely important to women's participation in paid work. But instead of acting on that, the federal government seems intent on fiddling around the edges to save money to satisfy the bean counters while ignoring the big issues for parents with kids in child-care&mdash;quality, accessibility and affordability.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The implementation of this pathetic bill leaves a great deal to be desired. There are some 26 pieces of subordinate legislation which were subject to lengthy delays in their supply to the child-care industry. The industry is still unaware of some of the changes that the government intends to introduce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government intended that this legislation should take effect initially from 1 January 1998. This is an unrealistic time frame, as many child-care services are closed over the December, January and Christmas break period. The government now appears to have recognised that in its legislation by the delay in implementation it announced yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received representations from child&hyphen;care groups in my own area about this very issue of the time frame. Many of the workers in this area, particularly those in the OOSH part of the industry, are very concerned at the time frame being inflicted upon them. This legislation will inflict further job losses in an already distressed industry. Hopefully, a new minister may see this with a clearer view. I make an appeal to the new Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) to agree to sufficient delay so that there will be enough time for child&hyphen;care organisations to do their sums to see not only what the social consequences will be but also what the industrial consequences of the legislation are going to be on the mostly women workers in this industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I draw to the attention of the new minister a summary of the problems that have been highlighted by the National Association of Community Based Children's Services. Firstly, fees in community owned centres have increased by up to $18 per child per week. This increase for the first six months of 1997 is double the annual increase for 1996. Secondly, in four states the weekly fee for one child in full&hyphen;time care is $170 or more. Thirdly, more than 25 per cent of centres in each state and territory have reduced staffing levels in an attempt to keep the fees down. The biggest cuts to staffing have been in Western Australia. Fourthly, 73 per cent of parents exiting care showed increased fees as the reason. The parent exit surveys in this study show that 67 per cent of families leaving centres are using informal care. Fifthly, 74 per cent of parent respondents reported their fees were to increase again before the end of 1997. Finally, many centres have been forced to adopt measures which seriously undermine service quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As in aged care, the performance of this government is simply not good enough and is a disaster for the parents and children. I urge the new minister to urgently review the government's treatment of Australia's parents in this important area of child care in all its various forms. I have much pleasure in once again indicating my support for the amendment moved by the opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to see the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R276">Child Care Payments Bill 1997</XREF>  as part of a range of changes that have already been introduced by the current government resulting in reduced hours, reduced funding, higher charges and reduced eligibility for assistance for fee relief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I took the initiative of surveying my local electorate in July and then again in October of this year following the implementation of some of those changes and asking those surveyed in some cases to anticipate what will occur when the changes in this legislation are implemented. This is a survey of both private and community based child&hyphen;care centres. It is clear in my own seat that there will be fee rises at 12 centres&mdash;right now there are fee rises of up to $21 a week and five centres 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9552"> expect to increase fees in the near future. Many of those are private centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That means that parents may be paying up to $170 a week in child&hyphen;care fees in my electorate. That is a huge expense in any family budget. The abolition of federal government operational subsidies for community based centres on 1 July placed a lot of centres under intolerable financial pressures and most have responded by reducing either staff, as they have done in spades in my own state of Western Australia, or other costs in order to keep the fee increases to a bare minimum. Nonetheless, they have had to increase them substantially. Some parents are now being asked to supply things that they previously did not have to supply, like meals and nappies and so on, to try to keep costs down. If you look around Australia, some 80,000 families who use community based child care are being affected by the short&hyphen;sighted changes in this budget, not to mention the private centres which are also having to increase fees. I expect that we will see more of that in my electorate and right around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield), referred to a survey that was released by the National Association of Community Based Children's Services, and there are similar results in the private sector. That survey showed that more than 400 families have withdrawn their children from long day care or reduced their patronage over the three months of that survey. A survey of 1,084 community child&hyphen;care centres revealed that fee increases&mdash;this is very important&mdash;are forcing many women to withdraw from the work force. This is a clear and direct result of government funding cuts. Others are remaining in the work force but taking their children out of long day care and placing them in informal and unregulated care. The losses, as we have heard, have been the greatest in Western Australia and South Australia, with some centres reporting a loss of more than 50 families. It means that they cannot be financially viable. The majority of the children who are being withdrawn, if their mothers or parents do not stop working, are being cared for by parents at home or by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relatives, friends and neighbours. Ten per cent have moved to home based day care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to a couple of important points. When I was minister in this area, we surveyed families around Australia in 1994. Remember, this was at a time when the number of places was increasing, there was financial assistance and there was growth in the sector. This 1994 research showed a number of things very clearly. When parents&mdash;both men and women; all income levels, all occupations&mdash;were interviewed they pointed out that society has changed dramatically from that of their grandparents. This is something that the government does not seem to understand. Families, by and large, need two incomes to survive. There are greater materialistic expectations in the 1990s than our grandparents had. Importantly, work, they say&mdash;and I say too&mdash;is a source of satisfaction and fulfilment for women as well as for men, and the extended family has declined because of social change and greater mobility. They noted too, if it needs to be noted, that families are smaller and there are more sole parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of those observations, child care has taken on a much more significant role because it allows parents, particularly women, to have more choices. It enables women to work. It is sad to say, in many respects, that the responsibility for child care remains a woman's domain. We cannot ignore that. Child care also enables sole parents&mdash;sole head of household income earners&mdash;to work. It helps relieve what I call the `supermother syndrome'&mdash;mothers do not have to juggle all those responsibilities quite so harshly. It provides a sanity break and time out for single parents&mdash;men and women alike. It allows parents to study, to retrain and to pursue interests so that they are saner parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also provides a facility when primary carers have other duties such as doctors' appointments. Importantly, in small families it also initiates the socialisation process. I was fortunate in coming from a large family, but many families today are small. Child care provides an opportunity for children to learn how to socialise with others. Very importantly too, it prepares under&hyphen;fives for school.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9553">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That survey shows that parents had concerns even then. Those concerns would be even greater now with these changes. Parents complained about the lack of places, the location of facilities and the relatively inflexible nature of some child-care arrangements. They were concerned about the quality of care, particularly in family day care. We attempted to address those concerns systematically. We are now seeing them ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 parents already felt that they often had to compromise on the type of care they could get, on the days and times that the care was available and on its location and affordability. The effects of those inadequacies included things like increased stress on both parents or on a single parent; reduction in choices for work and training, especially for women; a deterioration, they believed, in the quality of life; and lost employment opportunities. If those were concerns then, imagine how great those concerns are now. All of us have had letters and representations from men and women right around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents prefer formal care because of its reliability and continuity and because of the fact that children can socialise, take part in activities and have access to facilities that assist in learning. In formal care they are taught a routine and a discipline, they are cared for by trained carers and the ratio of carers is adequate for them. There is a feeling of quality of care resulting from the impression of scrutiny, accreditation and regulation. They much prefer that formal care as opposed to informal care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were concerned about informal care and even about family day care. They felt that sometimes, where there was only one person looking after their children, there were no obvious checks. They do not always like the discipline that differs from their own standards. They sometimes felt that in family day care there were less experienced and trained carers and there were not so many structured activities. There were concerns then, but this government is forcing more families into informal care, and there is a lack of places and costs have increased. These were all things parents were concerned about in 1994.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, 38 per cent of parents said that the hours and days available were too few and too inflexible. Multiply that manyfold, given this legislation. They felt that there were too few places. Again, the growth in places is being reduced by this government and funding is being cut. In 1994, 37 per cent of parents were concerned about the cost. I would say that 100 per cent of parents would now be concerned about the cost of child care, if my own electorate is any indication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things are important not just for themselves but because of the effect that they have on our community, particularly on women. I have had a chance to do some work on the effects on health&mdash;particularly health outcomes but there are other effects as well&mdash;of increasing inequality in our society. A lot of studies from many parts of the world have documented the very clear association between a person's wealth and their health. In any community, the poorer you are, the poorer your health is. This has been described by Kaplan as one of the most pervasive and enduring observations in public health. It has been observed for most diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have a look at recent work, though, you will find that the distribution of income is now very important. Recent cross&hyphen;national and intra&hyphen;nation studies have suggested a relationship not just between income levels and health and life expectancy but also between income distribution and health. The bigger the gap is between rich and poor in any community, the worse the health is. And, I might say, the lower the life expectancy is, the higher the crime rates are and the poorer the education outcomes are. The greater the gap in income is between the rich and the poor in any society, the poorer those outcomes are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, in his study of national income inequality among 11 industrialised countries&mdash;and, as we sit roughly in the middle of that group, we do not have anything much to crow about&mdash;Wilkinson reported a correlation of 0.81:1 between indices of inequality and life expectancy, and that is after controlling for the average level of wealth in the community. He illustrates this point with the contrasting experiences of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9554"> Britain and Japan. In 1970 those two countries had similar income distributions and similar life expectancies. Their citizens lived for roughly the same length of time and the gap between rich and poor was roughly the same, although it has to be said Britain was, on average, the wealthier country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then there has been a wide divergence. Japan now has the highest life expectancy in the world and the most egalitarian distribution of any country on record&mdash;ever. Conversely, in Britain income distribution has widened since the Thatcher experiment&mdash;and we are seeing some of that in this legislation&mdash;in the mid&hyphen;1980s and the mortality among men and women between 15 years old and 44 years old has actually increased. From having the same gap and the same health outcomes, Britain is now very much the poor relation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similar research in the United States, comparing state with state, has also revealed very significant correlations between the percentage of the total household income received by the less well&hyphen;off half in each state and mortality, for all sorts of illnesses. That is not affected by individual behaviours like smoking and drinking and so on. It is basically a function of the gap between rich and poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why am I talking about this in the context of child care? For a couple of reasons. We might ask why this matters in Australia, which we all regard, I think, as an egalitarian paradise. It matters principally because there is increasing evidence of growing inequality in the developed world and particularly in Australia over the last two years. I am not just saying that because I am a member of the Labor Party and we have just removed ourselves from government. I am saying it because it is happening. During our time in government we put a chock under the bottom end, and the evidence clearly shows that we did that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at Australia, as I say, in terms of international comparisons we sit somewhere in the middle. But the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling calculated that in 1990 the richest 10 per cent of Australian families received 23 per cent of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> national income while the poorest 10 per cent received less than three per cent. There has not been much change in that gap over an entire decade.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It got worse under you.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has not been change. Look at the data in Gregory and Hunter's analysis. The interjector needs to read the data from NATSEM. The gap between rich and poor did not increase to any significant extent. In fact, those at the bottom went down by 0.2 per cent. That is NATSEM's own work, and a lot of others have confirmed that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that, when you look at the total income as opposed to market based incomes, you see a difference. If governments do not transfer cash payments and non&hyphen;cash benefits to those low income families, then, of course, the gap is much wider. As long as governments continue to pay benefits&mdash;pay for Medicare, pharmaceuticals, and child care, might I say&mdash;then that gap is maintained at a reasonable level. Once you start to pull out those supports, the gap widens very dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it needs to be understood that that is happening in Australia as the role of government is diminished. For example, as we see cuts to child care, increases in pharmaceutical costs, reductions in hospital availability and reductions in pensions and benefits, we see an increasing gap between the rich and the poor in this community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the eyes of some, the sole criterion for assessing government performance&mdash;and clearly this is a view shared by most on the government side&mdash;should be the extent of reduction in government sector deficit with commensurate cuts to government programs. A lot of members on the opposite side seem to think that that is heroic. Associated with that is an insistence on the superiority of the private sector and the virtues of competition and deregulation. It is the crude rhetoric of getting government off the people's backs and making people pay for themselves. That is all very well if they can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the discussion about smaller government and private provision is conveyed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9555"> in the rhetoric of choice, to disguise the shift away from collective provision. Funds which are removed from child care, health and higher education institutions are alleged to give people greater choice to purchase those services with their own resources in the private sector. We are hearing some of that in the aged care debate. The prospect of exercising such choice, however, depends on having sufficient wealth to do so, and clearly many do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last two federal budgets and in many recent state budgets there have been significant cuts to both cash and non&hyphen;cash benefits to the poorer members of our community, including: reduced entitlements of young people for unemployment benefits, cuts to rent assistance for the unemployed, cuts to child&hyphen;care funding, increases in the costs of pharmaceuticals, lowering the threshold for HECS repayments, elimination of the Commonwealth dental program, tax rebates for the privately insured at the expense of funding for public hospitals, discriminatory tax treatment for two&hyphen;income families, reductions in the availability of publicly funded housing, cuts to labour market programs for the unemployed, and so on. That is by no means a complete list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These trends are not unique to Australia, sadly, but they threaten the fairness of our society and, given the evidence now available, our health and our physical and mental wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to these cuts to government funding in areas which directly and indirectly affect income inequality, changes to industrial relations legislation and the decentralisation of wages negotiation are adding to those pressures toward inequality. Since those in low skilled and non&hyphen;unionised workplaces, typically women, are less able to negotiate improved wages and conditions, recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicating that wages growth has slowed over the last three quarters and actually reversed in the last quarter&mdash;minus 0.1&mdash;are of great concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Data on executive salaries, on the other hand, indicates continuing and robust growth of 5.8 per cent over the year to June. As 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Kapstein, formerly an enthusiast for expanding the role of the market, has remarked, `Restrictive fiscal policy is undermining the bargaining structure of workers in every industrialised country.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that many people here today are aware of these pressures to inequality. They are occurring worldwide, and that is why the role of government is so critical. These relative income differences are related to the gradient in mortality and morbidity that I mentioned but also to social breakdown. And it stretches across all levels of the social hierarchy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The typical response to proposals for greater equity&mdash;and we hear it from members opposite&mdash;in the absence of a national crisis, is to complain that it is inimical to economic growth (if you tax people and if you redistribute income, people will not work hard enough) and that the best way to increase prosperity is to forget the differentials&mdash;the big gaps between rich and poor&mdash;and pursue the most rapid growth possible to enlarge the national cake rather than worrying about how it is cut up, which is what I am arguing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there is increasing evidence from both time series and cross&hyphen;sectional studies that shows that the greater the equity&mdash;in other words, the smaller the gap between rich and poor&mdash;the faster the economic growth. So it is perverse on that score, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All eight&mdash;until recently, at least&mdash;high performing Asian economies reduced their income differences between 1960 and 1980. Other studies have found that investment tends to be higher and productivity growth faster in countries where income differences are smaller. So it is a stupid economic policy as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to make a couple of specific references to women's position. These child&hyphen;care cuts&mdash;the last in a series and, I hope, the last forever&mdash;have a specific and detrimental effect on women and families with children. Those big income differences I mentioned are changed by government intervention in child care and other areas. Harding, at NATSEM, has found that married couples without children, without the role of government, enjoy the highest equivalent gross incomes, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9556"> followed by couples with children and sole parents. As I say, they are compensated for by government payments so that, at the end of the day, those with children come out on top. They benefit from government behaviour. That is why cuts to child care are so short&hyphen;sighted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to recognise that the work force participation of women has made a big difference to income inequality. Again, Harding's work at NATSEM estimated the effects of self&hyphen;employment, of shifts in part&hyphen;time work and of changes in labour force participation and unemployment rates on inequality. Her data, and data across the nation, supports the conclusion&mdash;and I underline this&mdash;that the rise in married women's labour force participation in the 1980s led to growing equality of income amongst married couples. Child care is critical to them remaining in the work, to equality in our community and ultimately to the health of our community. There is a great deal of data internationally that shows that effect. This government is not just hurting individual families in making these cuts; it is hurting the nation. It is hurting our health, it is hurting our education, it is hurting crime rates and it is hurting the growth in this nation's wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot think of anything more short&hyphen;sighted or perverse than this series of legislative changes that this government has initiated, and I know that families around this country condemn them for it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a great deal of pleasure talking this evening to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R276">Child Care Payments Bill 1997</XREF>  and the amendments that have been moved in relation to this bill. I would like to take the opportunity to completely endorse all of the remarks made by the previous speaker, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). She made some comments in relation to the wider and broader question of the reasons why we have child care in the first place, and those comments need to be looked at and thought about very carefully by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to make a note of the fact that there was an announcement by the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) in the last 24 hours or so in relation to the implementation date of the ramifications of these bills. While applauding that and acknowledging the fact that there is a delay from 1 January to a date late in April after Easter next year, it seems to me to be pretty obvious that there is now recognition that more time is needed and more consultation is required for the implementation of these initiatives as they stand. While doing that, I also want to take the point that, in that time, I hope we in this place and in the community 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9557"> as well as the families of this country and the people who operate within the child&hyphen;care centres can use that time to great advantage in making implicitly clear to the minister and the government their very strong views in relation to these initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do these changes really mean in our child&hyphen;care sector? What are they really going to do to our families who use child care? In asking that question, I refer to the findings of a survey that was done recently by the National Association of Community Based Children's Services. Some people could say that that is a vested interest area for a survey to come from&mdash;but that is the very point. That is the reason why we should look at it. The National Association of Community Based Children's Services has had a very good opportunity to do a very broad and deep survey following the cuts to the community sector of child care that came in some months ago. They are now in a position to say very clearly from that survey what sorts of outcomes have occurred in our community as a result of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They say very clearly, in black and white, that escalating child&hyphen;care fees are forcing families out of the quality care that they were used to getting through the community network; that child care is now just too expensive for a whole range of working parents; that fees in community owned child&hyphen;care centres have increased by many dollars, taking the levels up to $170 or more in some cases; and that 74 per cent of parents leaving those community owned centres in July were leaving due to the escalating costs. This is what has happened in the community area of child care since those cuts came into place. We only have to think about that and then translate it into an effect that will be felt when we look at the further implications of the Child Care Payments Bill 1997  and the  Child Care Payments (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1997 .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the measures that are going to be included in the changes under these bills include the abolition of the operational subsidy for outside school hours care and the introduction of a 20&hyphen;hour limit for child&hyphen;care services per week for people who are not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> working, studying or undergoing training. I have a particularly personal problem with that because I know of some families which have accessed more than 20 hours per week in the past for reasons other than working, studying or undergoing training for themselves, including caring for other children in the family who happen to have a disability or chronic illness, caring for other family members who are aged and a whole range of other reasons. There are also social implications for that because some families, and women particularly, find it a great boost or of great assistance to be able to access child care when they need it for their own personal benefit. When I say that I mean their own health and welfare. So I have a particular problem with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also going to see new long day care places limited to 7,000 in 1998 and 1999 with a saving of $207 million attached to that. In general, I fear very strongly that the bill is going to result in the closure of child&hyphen;care centres. It is definitely going to result in job losses in the child-care sector and it is definitely going to have an effective reduction in the availability and quality of child care. You cannot have a situation where $820 million is cut from child care over two budgets and not see a detrimental effect on the services provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes billed in the last budget saw operational subsidies cut to community long day care, fees rising at a level which people cannot keep up with, a reduction in hours in some centres and, unfortunately, a reduction in some quality and services available to children. The centres have reported that in some cases&mdash;not in all&mdash;less supervision of children can be seen, there has been a cutting back on equipment that is available for children, staff or staff hours have been cut and child numbers are down. In some cases, cuts will have to be made to cleaning services or to the quality of meals available to the children in these centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am really saying that the bottom line here is that, when you put these sorts of financial pressures onto centres operating for the care of children, something has to give. You either have to maintain the income level by increasing the fees to parents, or you somehow have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9558"> to find savings in other places. I find this particularly sad, given that we already were seeing, and had evidence to some extent of, the development of a very highly professional, world recognised level of child care in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I despair that we can run the risk of detrimentally affecting that and of not so much putting children at risk&mdash;because I believe that all of the people who operate in these child-care centres will not do that; they will do everything in their power not to have that happen&mdash;but that it will mean there could be an impact on the health and welfare of the staff and on job accessibility for people working in the centres. Somehow they have to make those dollars stretch to maintain their level of service, and I just do not know how they are going to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also fear that some people, ill&hyphen;advisedly, will find themselves resorting to non-accredited care; it is commonly called `backyard care'. I do not think we can afford to let that happen. We cannot allow that to become the norm. At the moment, I think something like 67 per cent of parents who are leaving child care are considering, or have already entered into, informal care&mdash;and I raise an alarm flag about that and worry about the implications.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that in the last three months, approximately, some 4,000 families have left child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My other big concern is the effect on women. Women are being forced out of work because they cannot afford child care. I know within my own electorate&mdash;and this is anecdotal, people have been speaking to me about this&mdash;that the major level of concern is this: up until now they have been able to make a choice. Nobody has forced the two parents of a family where that is the case, or the single parent where that is the case, to go out and work and use child care for their children. What has happened is that in this country we have been able to provide, as I have said, a very high, professional, secure level of child care, so that people were safe in choosing their options. If women wanted to have part&hyphen;time work or full&hyphen;time work, if the two parents wanted to share their career management in some way between themselves, they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> knew that they could do that with an enormous amount of security by accessing child care at an affordable level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening now is that, of those families who cannot justify the financial commitment, one parent is having to make the decision to cut back on their employment&mdash;in some cases, completely; in some cases, in a part-time fashion. But those options are being removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As this is a government that likes to parade itself proudly as being in favour of women, options, flexibility, and freedom for women, I find it a very, very hard dilemma to come to agreement with them on these changes. I just do not see how you can boast of being, and prove that you are, in favour of those things while at the same time removing so much of the option level in the area of child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we look at the area of outside of school hours care. This bill is threatening the continued operation of outside of school hours care by the removal of that operational subsidy. Many centres that I know within my area and within my specific electorate are extremely concerned about how on earth they will be able to continue to operate at the level at which they have. In fact, in some ways, outside of school hours care, in a funny sort of way, is even more important because it means that there is that added flexibility to the daytime arrangements for these families. It saves people from shunting children from place to place, particularly where the outside of school hours care centre is operating in conjunction with other educational child&hyphen;care facilities. For this to become an optional change, I think, is something to be deplored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no use having higher child-care assistance available to people if in the area there is no centre available for them at which to access outside of school hours care. I really want to make the point that in this day and age we really should be able to boast of a flexible, optional system, with high quality, professional, safe, secure care for our children, where families can design their work, their career and their family life in all honesty and in all security.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9559">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can see that, with the implementation of these changes, there will be an absolute threat of&mdash;and, in some cases, it will be definite&mdash;a change for the worse in the way that all of the child-care centres will operate. You only have to get out into your electorates yourselves and speak to people to find out how they feel about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I deplore the government for considering these particular changes. I sincerely hope that the delay in implementation that is occurring now is, as I said at the outset, going to give us an opportunity as a community, as members here and as operators within the child&hyphen;care sector to do something about convincing this government that these ideas are wrong, that they have got it wrong and that they somehow will have to change their view on these issues. I see the delay in implementation as a good sign; I see it as being that perhaps the minister and the government are willing to listen a little more carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that it is only the pressure brought to bear by the industry particularly, and by a number of constituents, I am sure, in a variety of seats, that has convinced the minister who is currently in charge of this area to listen to and hear those objections and defer accordingly. Let us hope that by next April, given the rest of this year and the sitting pattern for next year, we can continue that pressure and we can continue to influence the government in its decision to bring in these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the National Association of Community Based Children's Services has said, the removal of the operational subsidy from those centres in July has caused fees to rise above affordable levels; it has forced 74 per cent of parents leaving community owned centres to do so because of escalating costs. Of those people, I repeat, 67 per cent or thereabouts, we understand, have entered informal care. They are statistics that are undeniable. We have to think very seriously about what we are creating when we consider such changes to the child&hyphen;care sector as are being proposed by these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I speak very strongly on behalf of the amendments. I also look forward to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to return to one of my favourite topics, the Western Australian Liberal Party. Normally I would deal with the Western Australian Liberal Party and their members here, particularly if the member for Swan (Mr Randall) were in the chamber, as he is tonight. But tonight I want to do something different and focus on the Western Australian Liberals in the Senate. Why? Because the Western Australian Liberal senators are currently up for preselection. When nominations closed on 15 October there was a big field for three spots, because Senator Ellison, the minister, Senator Campbell, the parliamentary secretary, and Senator Knowles are all up for grabs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My spies&mdash;the member for Swan and the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) know that my spies in the Liberal Party are very good&mdash;tell me that Senator Campbell is in trouble. He is in trouble from Mr David Parker, the Liberal Party candidate for the seat of Kimberley at the last state election and the man who came third behind Senator Lightfoot in the casual vacancy preselection. Why is Ian in trouble? Ian is in trouble because he has dudded his base; he has dudded the great mining and prospecting industry in the north&hyphen;west and the north-eastern goldfields of Western Australia. He has been caught out over section 23(pa) of the Income Tax Amendment Act. At every step in the process, when he had a chance to stand up for the Western Australian prospecting industry, he has let them down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is Ian now doing? He is going back to Noel country&mdash;out there with the charters to the north&hyphen;west and the north&hyphen;east, desperately trying to drum up support. In the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9560"> process he is making the most outrageous misrepresentations in respect of section 23(pa). We know that on 13 December 1996, in a memo signed by all Western Australian Liberal senators, the state councillors of the Liberal Party, who have a role in these preselections, were told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State councillors will be pleased to know that as a result of urging by the WA Liberal senators, the Government accepted an amendment to extend the deadline for the tax free sale of mining leases by bona fide prospectors for 5 years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So on 13 December it was all their work, all Senator Campbell's work. But what do we discover in the course of this year when Senator Cook moved amendments in the Senate to remove this provision? We find this reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  on Tuesday, 28 August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Democrat Senator Andrew Murray said yesterday that WA Liberal Senator Ian Campbell, who is parliamentary secretary to Mr Costello, had lobbied him to vote against an amendment that would give prospectors a five&hyphen;year breathing space before the tax is introduced.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Campbell's lobbying in favour of the tax has angered members of the Liberal State Council.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So he is sprung by Senator Murray, who says he had actually been out there trying to lobby against it. Senator Campbell is not slow on these things. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senate Red</EMPHASIS> , which is his weekly newsletter, dated August 29, shortly after he has been sprung by Murray, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To those who would like to discuss the details of the five year grandfathering provisions negotiated by the Liberal Senate team (with the acknowledged support of Democrat Senator Andrew Murray) I invite you to contact me.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it has gone from all his work to, `We acknowledge Senator Andrew Murray after he springs me in the parliament.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then on 13 September we find that Ross Lightfoot is going to cross the floor on the issue. He never ended up crossing it. I have got a letter from Lightfoot to Campbell dated 26 September saying it is all shocking and terrible. Ian, not making much progress, decides as a last resort to communicate with the preselectors through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kalgoorlie Miner</EMPHASIS>. So on 30 September he gets a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kalgoorlie Miner</EMPHASIS> which is signed by all the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Western Australian senators on 23(pa) which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We as Liberal Senators for Western Australia have campaigned heavily for the amendment to accommodate the concerns expressed by miners and prospectors.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We as Western Australian Liberal Senators lobbied extensively for a five&hyphen;year transition period for miners and prospectors . . . The valuation requirements were inserted by the Labor Party and the Democrats in the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You really need to see the three drafts of the letter. The first draft came out from Chris Ellison's fax at 9 o'clock on 2 October. The handwritten changes came out at 12 o'clock and it took them until 6 o'clock that night to get it to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kalgoorlie Miner</EMPHASIS>. Do you know why? Because all the other Liberal senators were saying to Ian, `Ian, we are not quite sure we can say all this, mate. We are not quite sure it is true. We think this is a big porky.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to briefly speak on two matters tonight. The first is to comment on the Senate decision last night in regard to the unfair dismissal law and to say what an outrageous, disgraceful decision that was by the Labor Party and the Democrats. Today in question time it was raised, and the matter of their knowledge of small business was thrown around the chamber. The reaction from the other side was quite incredible when you think about it. I sat there and I looked down the list of the people sitting on the front bench, and I thought, `Well, it is probably no surprise that they do not really understand small business and they do not really understand what we are about and how important this particular amendment is to the very small businesses.' I looked along the front bench. I will not name them but I wrote them down.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter I want to speak on in the adjournment debate tonight relates to answers to questions on notice in the back of yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The first couple of questions are very interesting. The first two questions were from the member for Werriwa, Mr Latham. The first relates to the cost of running the Lodge and Kirribilli House. The second relates to the cost of running the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;the staff, staff travel, car allowances. Given it has been a pretty topical thing in the last few weeks around the country, I thought it was quite interesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Clearly, the member for Werriwa thought that he was being quite smart in asking these questions. He thought that he was going to expose some enormous expenditure because the Prime Minister has his base in Sydney&mdash;even though we all know that the Prime Minister has to be where the Prime Minister is and he would probably spend just as much time in Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide and wherever else he is required to be. It is quite irrelevant when it comes to cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The expenditure is rather interesting. The Prime Minister in answer gave a comparison between the first full year of the coalition government and the last full year of the Keating government. The recurrent funding is the main one, but we will give all the costs. The total cost of the operations of the Lodge and Kirribilli House in the first full year of the Howard government was $3.434 million. In the last full year of the Keating government it was $3.74 million. So it is over $300,000 more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The recurrent funding is probably more typical for comparison. Under the Howard government it was $2.969 million as opposed to Keating's $3.613 million. They are the chardonnay socialists&mdash;the Bollinger Bolsheviks, as somebody said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If you look also at the staff costs and staff travel&mdash;those opposite supposedly would make merry hell of all of these things&mdash;you will find that the total cost of travel for staff under the Keating government in his last year was $312,000 as opposed to $151,000 under the Howard government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk about the Department of Veterans' Affairs and what seems to me to be a preoccupation with rules and regulations rather than outcomes. In the past couple of weeks, two separate but unrelated cases have come across my desk in which a couple of constituents have been penalised simply because they did not follow the rules and the bureaucratic procedures to claim entitlements which otherwise would have flowed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The first involves an 84-year-old blind ex&hyphen;serviceman&mdash;he happens to be the brother of a former colleague, Senator Reg Withers&mdash;who required surgery. Unbeknown to this gentleman and his local medical officer, who happened to be a locum at the critical time, it turned out that, under the rules, the officer should have advised the Department of Veterans' Affairs that the patient had elected to be treated in a private hospital in Western Australia. Had he done so, this locum, unfamiliar with the rules, would have been advised that authorisation would not be given because the same service is offered at Royal Perth Hospital, which is a public hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that he had a legitimate claim and a legitimate condition which would qualify him for treatment, he was denied any sort of support whatsoever in the end. The LMO admitted his oversight. Of course that became the basis for a lack of entitlement. It also leaves me and my constituent incredulous. He could have sued the doctor for negligence, but he is not that sort of bloke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite my request to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) to exercise his discretion in the circumstances, the minister's response was to observe that there is no record to indicate that the patient followed the correct procedure and that, therefore, under the terms of the treatment principles he is unable to assist in this situation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second instance concerns a fairly recently widowed woman who is being denied her claim for a funeral benefit following the death of her husband. She is being denied this assistance not because her husband did not die and not because she did not qualify for the benefit but because she did not apply for it within 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It appears to me that, for someone to successfully claim for this entitlement, they have to make representations to the department within a 12-month period following the death of his or her partner. However, there is nothing on the application form to indicate that that is required. Nor did department personnel advise my constituent of the deadline when sending out the application form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The woman has received professional advice that, had her claim been submitted within the recognised time frame, it would have been approved. When your spouse dies you probably are in no condition to think about those things. At a time of great personal sadness, she had to deal with a department hell&hyphen;bent on following correct procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Given the slightest opportunity, the minister in this place goes to great lengths, with some justification, to advise us of the professional and compassionate approach his department takes when dealing with its members. I regret to advise that what he avoids to say is that this compassion is extended only to those who subscribe to all the rules and all the regulations of the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the two cases I have just referred to, the department is sending a clear message to all ex&hyphen;service men and women that departmental procedures take precedence over the entitlements which otherwise would apply to an individual. It has been indicated on not one but two occasions that, should anyone not observe the guidelines, the rules and the silly and petty little requirements, they can expect to be met with a bloody&hyphen;minded, `You failed to adhere to the correct procedures.' They are given a `there is nothing to be done' type attitude. That is simply not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that there is a need for rules and regulations, but when you are talking about the diggers you have to be a little bit more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9563"> sensitive, and that is not coming through. The minister is great with his policies and with what they have done since he has become minister. But, in the administration of the day-to-day rules, this is the sort of bloody nonsense that my constituents have had to put up with. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9563"><TITLE>Gillespie, Ms Rosemary: New Guinea</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to report to the House on a matter of grave concern in New Guinea. Recently I returned from a parliamentary visit to the South Pacific. The matter I wish to talk about concerns Rosemary Gillespie, who is well known to this country through her activism in the South Pacific and her current role in Bougainville, which has been going on for some time. I believe I am supported on the crossbenches on this because I have newspaper cuttings here which have Gareth Evans, Martin Ferguson and Bob Hogg when he was here also coming out and slamming Ms Gillespie's role in this region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Gillespie considers herself a human rights campaigner. She is a law graduate from Monash, et cetera. Before I go on further to talk about Ms Gillespie I must give the background. In 1987 she was arrested and deported from Fiji for trying to involve herself in the internal matters of Fiji. She was also arrested in Vanuatu in 1994, and she has been involving herself in Bougainville since 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big problem with this is not that Ms Gillespie is not compassionate&mdash;I would give her a chance to say that that is some of her motivation&mdash;but we know that a few weeks ago at Burnham in New Zealand the New Zealand government and Australia flew representatives from the BRA, Bougainville and Papua New Guinea to New Zealand to try to resolve the Bougainville problem. We know that that problem revolves largely around Francis Ona, the Panguna mine in Bougainville and trying to resolve the large number of deaths and conflict in that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is coming together. The ministers and members that we met on our delegation in New Guinea were able to tell us that it is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> progressing towards a resolution and they are heading towards an autonomous government on Bougainville, not an independent state like Ona wants but an autonomous government eventually. That is a huge leap forward from where they have been on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer now to the problem with Rosemary Gillespie. She has visited there frequently. She is an enemy of the state of New Guinea. I have a headline here that says `PNG may try a lawyer in her absence'. I have a whole heap of these cuttings here. She will not go through the normal channels in Papua New Guinea now. She goes through the Solomon Islands, through Honiara, which is very close to Bougainville. She puts a lot of people's lives at risk. She has been saying that she has been taking medicines there. If she has, that is good, but there have been other allegations about what she has actually taken there, and that includes arms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very dangerous situation because, with this peaceful resolution that they are heading towards in Bougainville, Francis Ona is being isolated by the BRA because of his extreme position. The BRA is coming to a point where they would like to resolve it. There is a lost generation of children there who have never been to school in their lives. I am told that they are young, gun-toting kids who have never had an education. The health system has broken down. The whole fabric of society has broken down in Bougainville because it is lawless and they cannot get aid in there. There is a situation of conflict the whole time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably one of the most alarming things is that people thought that Rosemary Gillespie had dropped out of this situation, but it is not true. I am informed that she returned last year with her daughter Kirrallee at some grave danger to themselves because of the antipathy towards her role in dividing the Bougainville situation. Many members of the BRA say that she is not welcome there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that it is also causing problems for Mr Ona himself. I am told that she is back in Australia now, but she is in continual contact with him by satellite phone. New Guinea would like to see her out of the situation and stop this troublemaking in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9564"> South Pacific and Bougainville so that this matter can eventually be resolved. I ask the Australian government to take more notice of these subversive activities of Rosemary Gillespie in Bougainville, otherwise peace will not come to that island.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9564"><TITLE>Minister for Family Services</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, before I begin, I wish you a happy birthday. I understand it is your birthday today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a fine example in this House during question time both today and yesterday of the complete incapacity of the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) to get a grasp on his portfolio. A reporter for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, Mike Seccombe, said today that the minister was floundering about like a fish out of water, looking strikingly similar to that former leader of the coalition, Dr Hewson, when he lost the plot explaining how his GST would affect the sale of&mdash;remember it&mdash;the humble birthday cake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as that failure of Dr Hewson's was a crucial turning point in the community's acceptance&mdash;or should I say non-acceptance&mdash;of the GST at the 1993 election, so too has the minister's faltering performance over the past couple of days convinced Australians that all is not well in the way of aged care reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Now the minister faces another challenge&mdash;a poison pill after being handed the poisoned chalice, as the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) put it during the MPI today. It relates to his decision yesterday to defer changes to the system of child-care payments until Easter next year&mdash;an admission to all and sundry that the government does not know what it is doing and is in danger of plunging the administration of child&hyphen;care payments into a nightmare world of complexity and complication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has said that the delay is simply because he has listened to `the concerns of the community'. What a laugh! If his government was listening to the concerns of the community, he would still be the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and not stepping over the political carcass of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the previous Minister for Family Services and trying to make a purse out of a pig's ear with the government's aged care reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the changes in child&hyphen;care payments, both parents and the child&hyphen;care industry are scratching their collective heads over the government's intentions. None of the changes have been adequately explained. When people call the department for clarification, the public servants whose job it is to explain these matters are unable to help. They have been kept in the dark as to what is involved and they just do not have a clue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am beginning to feel a sense of deja vu about this whole situation. I seem to remember a similar chain of events occurring in relation to the aged care changes when the previous minister for this portfolio was in charge. Those changes were meant to come into effect on 1 July, but because of the previous minister's incompetence, because of her failure to get the system working smoothly and to adequately inform the aged care industry, pensioner groups and even the department's own staff about the changes they had to be postponed until 1 October, not that such a delay has done the government any good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fear the government is sailing down the same tortuous path in relation to child&hyphen;care payments. The people in the child&hyphen;care sector and the parents in the community recognise the same fact. To illustrate this, I recently received a letter from a gentleman who operates several preschools in my area, a Mr Larry Rundle.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Rundle articulates the confusion shared by so many of his fellow members within the child&hyphen;care industry. In particular, Mr Rundle feels the government has not done enough to tell people in his position&mdash;via the body which will be responsible for administering the payments come April next year, Centrelink&mdash;about the government's new priority system of child&hyphen;care payments.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a nutshell, Mr Rundle wants to know how much financial assistance parents using his child care centres should be expecting. Mr Rundle writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Centrelink cannot tell me whether non working parents will be allowed 2 days care or 20 hours care.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9565">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Centrelink cannot tell me what a priority 1, 2, 3 or 4 is, as they have not dealt with this system before&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They have no knowledge of it. He continues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Centrelink cannot tell what constitutes a priority 1 or 4, I cannot tell parents: (a) how much care they will be entitled to in 1998; (b) I cannot explain to parents how to become a priority 1 rating so they can access 50 hours care for their child; and (c) I cannot help educate parents regarding studying, looking for work, etc, to coincide with this priority system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These major problems make it impossible to take placements for more than 2 days and a large number of children are coming 3 and 4 days and do not know what it is in store for them and some of these parents may already be eligible for 50 hours.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">From his letter, Mr Rundle's frustration and confusion is palpable. So far, neither the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) nor his predecessor has exhibited any intention of adequately explaining these changes to people in his position.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am glad to see the delay in the implementation of these child&hyphen;care payments. However, if that is all it is&mdash;a delay&mdash;without any of the work that needs to be done to explain these changes out there in the community, if it is going to be another nursing home entry fee debacle, then I do not know hold out much hope for Mr Rundle's sanity or his business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Family Services has a lot of pressure on him at the moment&mdash;pressure he is willing to shoulder. In the short time he has been in the job he has not filled anyone with any confidence&mdash;certainly not his own team members who are not rushing to his support. He is going to have to do some heavy work over the next seven months to make sure that child&hyphen;care payment changes are adequately explained to people like Mr Rundle and to parents around the country. If he does not, come next Easter, he will find himself in a similar situation to the one he is experiencing now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already made written representation on behalf of my constituent because he has so many concerns over the area of child care. His second concern&mdash;and I will not have enough time to put it here tonight&mdash;is one that is just as dangerous for the industry and

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak today on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R304">Airports Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  which will facilitate the second phase in the sale of federal airports. On 1 July 1997 we saw the first phase of the sale of Federal Airports Corporation entities&mdash;Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports. Naturally, I have a very keen interest in the sale of the Perth airport, because it lies within my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Your electorate is well represented.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PK6">Mr RANDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. I also have a genuine interest in the other airport sale in Western Australia&mdash;of Jandakot airport&mdash;not only because it adjoins my electorate but also because I was&mdash;before my time as a member of this House&mdash;the chairman of the planning committee of the city of Belmont and also the deputy member of the Perth airports municipalities group, which takes both of these airports as their main business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the Perth airport was sold for $643 million to Airstralia Development Group, and the revenue raised here adds to a very efficient and substantial privatisation package, along with the revenue raised by the sale of the other airports. We are all going to benefit from the revenue raised and we are all going to continue to benefit from the excellent manner in which Australian airports are being managed privately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state of Western Australia, the Perth airport remains under the good guidance and management of Graham Muir who steered the airport's operations while the FAC controlled it. As I have said previously, I am very pleased to see that Mr Graham Muir now heads the Western Australian airports group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This same airport has recently won an award for excellence in airport management and operation, and this highlights the success of privately owned and run airports compared with publicly or government owned airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Recently, I met with Westralia Airports Corporation and they broadly outlined their proposed management plan which has very strict regulations to ensure that the concerns of local residents and businesses are taken into account during the operation and further development of the airport. These regulations encompass many areas of airport operation: environmental and heritage concerns, construction and development laws of local and state planning authorities and, of course, aircraft noise and traffic management. In fact, there is plenty of evidence to demonstrate that the new private owners of the Perth airport, as indeed of other airports around Australia, are managing their airports productively and efficiently but, most importantly, in a responsible manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many good examples of privatisation and private ownership. In fact, the previous government, as we know, involved themselves in the sale of Australian Airlines, Qantas, and the Commonwealth Bank. I would ask anybody to challenge the fact that these entities are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9569"> being run, if not more efficiently, then certainly as efficiently as they were before. In fact, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) would know that there was a hue and cry when the Midland workshops were sold and privatised in Western Australia so that you would have thought that the world, as we knew it, would end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the business that was being done at those workshops is now not only being done more efficiently but is also benefiting many people. Companies like Gemco have provided an excellent service, and we do know that privatisation is not all bad. In particular, this was something that was proposed by the previous government, so it is with pleasure that I welcome the government's phasing&hyphen;in of the second round of airport sales, where the airports will be offered for sale by way of long&hyphen;term lease or, in some circumstances, on a freehold basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to refer to Jandakot airport in particular because it is the airport that is in Western Australia. However, I need to put on the record at the beginning that this bill does provide scope for the freehold sale of five general aviation airports including Jandakot. The others are Essendon, Moorabbin, Archerfield and Parafield and the regional airports of Mount Isa and Tennant Creek. Jandakot airport is in the area directly adjoining my electorate of Swan. It is known as one of the busiest airports in Australia. In fact, I am informed that it is the busiest airport in the Southern Hemisphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this bill, the Jandakot airport in Western Australia, as a general aviation airport, will be available on a freehold basis. This introduces some flexibility to the privatisation regime, as previously the sale of the airports was on a long&hyphen;term basis only. The opposition is opposing this aspect of the bill&mdash;the flexibility for some airports to be sold freehold and for the state law to apply to them. The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) demonstrates the opposition's motives for this. They want the Commonwealth to retain the regulatory role that they currently play and do not want it shifted to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Melbourne also says that to do so would be detrimental to the aviation industry. I cannot see how shifting the regulatory role from the Commonwealth to the states automatically downgrades the safety and service, but the member for Melbourne seems to. He seems to think it would be ruinous to our aviation industry. This is a typical centralist sort of attitude which you would expect from the opposition. Why would an intrastate airport, with all the local benefits and local knowledge, be controlled from Canberra? It is ludicrous. You take away the ability of local authorities and local residents to have an input into the running and operation of something that affects them very directly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the example of many hundreds of local airports around the country, the freehold arrangements that would be in place for the Jandakot, Essendon and other airports would be on no different a footing from those that are already held under freehold title since they were transferred from the Commonwealth and subsequently had state law applied to their planning development. As an example, Merredin, the town I come from, has a state controlled airport. This airport has developed not only by transferring into this regime but also because Singaporean pilots now come there to do their training. We have plenty of free space in that part of the wheat belt.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PK6">Mr RANDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, there are very good reasons, regional ownership and state ownership having done good things, for airports to be held in freehold within the state and not controlled from Canberra. As I said, not only has the state controlled, Western Australian, airport in Merredin developed the airport but we have brought a significant industry to this airport by allowing the Singaporean air force to train there and not crowd the metropolitan skies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are certain protections for residents and other interested parties in this bill, as there were in the Airports Act 1996, which provided for the sale of the major airports. This will ensure that the management of the airports, once privatised, continues in line with the standards in place when under government control. In other words, there is no diminution of standards or control. Because of these protections or regulations I am quite certain my constituents in Swan will not suffer nor be disadvantaged. It will, of course, ensure that the new owners of Jandakot airport will continue the same good neighbour policy that they have now and which the Perth airport currently practises. In fact, it will allow the residents to have a far greater input into the consultation phase of the master plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also with some interest that I note that the sale program of the former Federal Airports Corporation is reported to be the largest airport asset sale of its type in the world. I have not heard any criticism since 1 July&mdash;I know it is early days&mdash;but it seems to be all quite positive and we know it was supported by the opposition. It is with a lot of interest that I note the different style of negotiations set down by this government compared with those of the former government who were quite prepared to sell both Perth airport and Jandakot airport in a fire sale fashion and at a ridiculous price for the pair because they wanted to get rid of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give you a little insight. When I was the chairman of the planning committee on the Belmont City Council, we met with the then member for Swan, Mr Beazley, the mayor, and officers of the City of Belmont. Mr Beazley outlined his vision for the sale in a package deal involving Perth and Jandakot airports. I cannot forget his comment. Because Jandakot was a bit of a millstone as an airport, the only way to bail it out was to package it up with the Perth airport, throw several million dollars at it to allow the new buyer to find it attractive, and to be rid of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not got it here, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I am happy eventually to supply the council minute of that meeting just to show the attitude of the current member for Swan, Mr Beazley, towards getting rid of Jandakot. We know that there will be private buyers that are interested in buying Jandakot as a successful entity and, certainly, they will not be going into it to lose money. I also remember that some of the figures bandied around in that meeting of the Belmont City Council were far less than the $643 million that was gained for the Perth airport. So the sale so far has been quite judicious and responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's amendments to this bill&mdash;and I did listen to the member for Melbourne when he spoke in the House yesterday&mdash;include a strengthening of the cross&hyphen;ownership policy. I am on the record as having supported&mdash;indeed, lobbied&mdash;the then Minister for Transport to ensure that the Perth airport would not be in a cross&hyphen;ownership deal with Sydney. It would have been very detrimental for the Perth airport to become an adjunct to the Sydney airport. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9571"> Given our location on the western seaboard, and knowing the size and the strength of the Sydney airport operation I, like many others, feared that it would become a very poor relation if it were in the same ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stood for this and so did other colleagues of mine, including Senator Crane and Premier Richard Court. We lobbied very heavily. I remember, particularly, speaking to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), after question time one day. I know that it was an eleventh hour decision, but it was the right decision. I am very pleased to say that I did have an input into that and I am glad the government listened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thankfully, and due to this good approach, we do not have that cross&hyphen;ownership position in place now, though I see the member for Melbourne wants the cross&hyphen;ownership policy legislated and extended beyond a two&hyphen;year proposal. If this is the case, doesn't the member for Melbourne have any faith in the ACCC to regulate competition policy? This bill provides for a two&hyphen;year set down period and, after that, for business to operate in a responsible manner, regulated by the ACCC. I see no problems with that and I find it difficult to understand why the member for Melbourne does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government proposes to provide a zero cross&hyphen;ownership policy in relation to the airports in Brisbane and Coolangatta, Melbourne and Adelaide, Hobart and Launceston. As I said, this will be regulated after a two&hyphen;year period by the ACCC. This meets all of the regional expectations. What it does not do, as the opposition's proposal would, is to actually allow 15 per cent ownership of Coolangatta by Brisbane airport, and the same arrangement to apply between Hobart and Launceston. The current legislation limits cross&hyphen;ownership between Sydney and other major airports to 15 per cent, and this is what the opposition now intends to allow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also see that the member for Melbourne does not agree that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is superfluous to the consultative and decision making process. Efficient discussion and consultation mechanisms are already in place with management plans which invite extensive public consultation. This is seen in the sale of the Perth airport. There is a 90&hyphen;day consultation period and I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there are many interest groups who will involve themselves in this extensive consultation period. There are some strong lobby groups that will not allow the opportunity to pass them by. I am sure that this is the responsible approach to take, not to lay another level of bureaucracy, another level of hindrance, over the operation and sale of a public asset such as the further sale of the federal airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's attitude to the AAT reflects their complete lack of understanding of the act and the regulatory regime which applies to leased airports. Laying another level of bureaucracy over it would also allow it to be increasingly politicised and be a burdensome practice, and provide hurdles in the way of business in this country and of getting on with the job of doing business. I know that the current airport owners support the amendment to the bill which provides for a default approval by the minister of an airport management agreement, or a variation of an airport management agreement after 28 days. This is sensible and negates some of the unnecessary bureaucratic processes we have seen in the past which not only tie up ministers and departments, but the actual body seeking the approval. As you know, time is money when you are talking about business approval and business in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are several aspects regarding the Jandakot airport that must be taken in context. Currently, because it is a federally owned airport, development has been allowed right to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9572"> fringes of the airport. There is a lot of pressure on the local residents. As I said, it is the busiest airport in the Southern Hemisphere, and even though they are light aircraft, in general, they cause a noise problem. I even had one of the councillors from the Leeming area tell me that his boy used to stand in the backyard trying to throw stones at the planes because they hated them so much. There certainly was no novelty seeing a Cessna fly over his house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has happened because there is this incongruous control of the airport&mdash;an airport federally controlled from Canberra. The state authorities did not even have the opportunity to put a notice on the title of these houses that were under flight paths. When it is owned, or on a long leasehold, if that is the case, in Western Australia, these sorts of things can be done. You can have far better controls over planning and planning approvals with the local authorities or in concert with the local authorities. It is with these things in mind that I say that with the privatisation&mdash;and I know that the opposition agrees with the privatisation because they were the people who began this process&mdash;the detail is that the states should control the domestic airports that have the light airport industry in their state and that the industry should be given the opportunity to get on with its business, not to go through a raft of what I believe are unnecessary amendments which will only hinder this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some move to see that Jandakot airport is moved out of the metropolitan area but, as we know, this bill does not agree with that. In fact, a section of this bill says that the sites continue as airports, that before any airport is sold freehold it will be ensured that the state and territory laws do not impede the continued airport operation and that the airport site will be restricted and will continue to be used as such.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think any sensible person in Western Australia&mdash;and I know it applies to the other airports, but you will not mind my bias in speaking to this from a Western Australian perspective&mdash;will agree that there are problems which will continue to have to be sorted out in terms of airspace because of the busyness of the Jandakot airport and the proximity of the Pearce air base. However, I believe that these matters can be resolved far better at a local level in Western Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I wish this morning to speak on the  <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R304">Airports Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  and, like my Western Australian colleague the member for Swan (Mr Randall), I will focus on some Western Australian implications. The member for Swan and I normally have robust debates in the chamber of the House itself, Mr Deputy Speaker, but given the civilised decorum which I know you, more than most, encourage&mdash;indeed, insist on&mdash;in this chamber, I will be somewhat more judicious, civilised, circumspect and charitable in my comments today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mind you, I do see the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) on the speakers' list after me. I am not sure that he will be quite so charitable. But there are some important points which need to be made. The member for Swan has touched upon both Perth airport and Jandakot. I propose to touch upon Perth airport firstly because that is the major domestic and international airport in Western Australia and is an important economic asset to the state and, secondly, because in a local context, like the member for Swan, it affects my electorate. That is not the case so far as Jandakot is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), has circulated a range of amendments which reflect the opposition's view of this bill and they will be returned to the House for consideration there in due course. The legislation itself refers to Perth airport. This is omnibus legislation which effects legislation by schedule. Items 4 and 9 of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9573"> schedule number 1 list Perth airport as what is described as a core regulated airport and that reflects, as the minister said in his second reading speech, the status and the standing of those airports which were the phase 1 privatised airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is an important aspect in the legislation which goes to the regulation of those airports which this legislation seeks to change and which the opposition and I oppose. That goes to the question of the adoption by a privatised airport owner of a master or development plan. As the member for Swan outlined and most members who have airports in their areas would understand, following the privatisation of the airports, a new owner is required within 12 months to present a master plan or development plan, as described in the legislation, for approval by the minister. There is a consultation process that is required in the course of that exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of Perth, as the member for Swan well knows, the new owners, Airstralia Development Group, are required to present a development plan for Perth under the legislation by July of next year. Under the current legislation, that is approved or not approved by the minister after a process of consultation. But, under the legislation as it currently stands, the minister's decision in respect of that development plan is subject to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the AAT, by any affected resident or interested person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is that right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which this legislation seeks to remove. I argue and the opposition argues that this was a right given to potentially adversely affected residents surrounding an airport under the legislation which existed at the time privatisation occurred. It was in our legislation; it was in the member for Swan's government's legislation. What they now seek to do after privatisation of the airports is to remove that right at precisely that point in the cycle when the development plans will fall due for consideration. So you take out of the system something which potentially adversely affected residents and interested persons thought they had when the privatisation of the airports were undertaken. That can potentially have significant and adverse consequences for residents who live around Perth who may have an interest in the proposed development plan presented to the minister by the new airport owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are some of the things which might fall due for consideration in that master plan? So far as Perth airport is concerned, there is a master plan that has been in place since the mid&hyphen;1980s and that master plan, as the member for Swan will appreciate, envisages a parallel runway in the fullness of time. Anyone who speaks to the owners or operators or people interested in the airport acknowledges that the introduction of a parallel runway at Perth airport, if it ever occurs, is not something likely to occur within the next 25 or 30 or 40 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a key point here which goes to the adoption of master plans and development plans around airports. Because the current master plan has been in place for about a decade, that is the basis on which long-term planning around the airport has proceeded. Perth airport is well served by interested local authorities who have formed the Perth Local Authorities Airport Group. These are the interested local authorities who determine, at the local level, the land use regime around the airport. They are the members of this local airport organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Swan would primarily be interested in the city of Belmont, which is a large part of his electorate. Other local authorities are in my electorate and they include the city of Bayswater, the town of Bassendean and the shire of Swan. The basis upon which these local authorities have proceeded for 10 years is the master plan which has been in place since the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9574"> mid&hyphen;1980s. That is a very important aspect because if you now change the master plan, then 10 years of land use planning around the airport goes out the window.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What aspirations do people have for Perth airport? I believe that Perth airport is a very important economic asset to Western Australia by way of international trade and international tourism, but also internally for the state by way of the minerals and resources industry in the eastern goldfields and in the north&hyphen;west of Western Australia. For a large, geographically diverse state, economic growth, trade and jobs are what it is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time you want to make sure that now or in the longer term Perth airport does not end up with the sorts of problems we now see at Sydney, and with sensible management you can achieve that. A bad management decision made now, a bad investment decision made now, or a bad planning decision made now, will have dire consequences in 10, 20 or 30 years time. That is the importance of making sure that whatever development or master plan is adopted now is a sensible one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the most appropriate way of seeking to manage an urban airport, the state's important domestic and international airport, in a way in which you avoid the worst excesses of disruption to the local communities? There are a range of things which need to be taken into account and acted upon by way of policy measures. Who are those residents who are most adversely affected? In the case of Perth airport, from my geographical location, they are residents who live in South Guildford and Guildford. From the member for Swan's perspective they also include people who live in South Guildford as they are now redistributed into his electorate, but in terms of numbers they are more so at the southern part of his electorate in the city of Belmont.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have argued for some time that what we ought to have in place in Perth is an extension of the noise compensation arrangements that apply to Sydney airport. There are people in Perth who live around Perth airport. Yes, they are far fewer in number but in a qualitative sense those people, particularly those who live in South Guildford, are as adversely affected by noise around Perth airport as some of the people in Sydney are affected by noise from Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The compensation regime which is in place for Sydney airport ought to be extended to Perth airport. That commitment was given by the previous Labor government. A noise audit contract was on the desk of the minister when the 1996 election was called, but it has not been proceeded with by this government. If you want to sensibly manage the airport you have to have a compensation program in place so that the most seriously adversely affected residents have some amelioration from noise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, you have to get the land use planning right, which is why the local authorities around Perth airport have tried over time to be so diligent about these matters, and which is why you do not want to change the rules half way through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned the proposed parallel runway in the master plan. What is also in the master plan at Perth airport is a reference to runway 0624, which is the north&hyphen;east, south&hyphen;west runway. Currently, the master plan envisages a modest extension of 0624 but there is one thing that aficionados are aware of which is an important point to make. Firstly, the noise contours, which are included in the master plan for Perth airport, are predicated on the basis that 0624 will not be used for take&hyphen;offs to the south&hyphen;west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important to the constituents of the member for Swan, and it is very important to my constituents. If take&hyphen;offs are allowed from runway 0624 to the south&hyphen;west, depending upon 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9575"> the prevailing breeze, if they turn to the north and to the west, suburbs such as East Perth, Mt Lawley, Maylands, Inglewood, Bedford, Bassendean, Beechboro, Morley and Embleton, which have never previously been substantially or at all affected by airport noise, will be dramatically affected by airport noise. So the noise contours in the master plan are predicated on the basis of no southerly take&hyphen;offs from runway 0624.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you extend runway 0624 and you take off to the north and the west, then you need to be very careful about that because you can potentially adversely affect, in a way in which they are not currently affected, people who live in the suburb of Bellevue and people who live in the suburbs of Midland and Midvale. The planning that has occurred in respect of the shire of Swan, the relevant local authority, has been predicated on the basis of no extension to runway 0624 but on the parallel runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further item, the configuration of Perth airport, is a suggestion recently that Perth be subject to a curfew. This was a suggestion made by Western Australian Democrat Senator Andrew Murray. Frankly, I was surprised that Senator Murray made this suggestion. When he made the suggestion, he was the Democrat spokesperson for small business and industry and he is now the Democrat spokesperson for treasury and economic matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only consequence of a curfew at Perth airport would be to substantially and seriously impinge upon the economic viability of Perth airport and in many respects, in the long term, kill the economic viability of Perth airport. Perth airport is a staging ground for the international airline companies which come to Australia. If you have a curfew between 12 o'clock at night and 6 a.m., as Senator Murray suggested, you will destroy the long&hyphen;term economic viability of Perth airport. A curfew will mean a substantial diminution in international tourism, a substantial diminution in international trade, and a substantial diminution for Western Australia in economic growth, trade and jobs. It will have local adverse consequences as well because Western Australia's great minerals and resources industry utilises Perth airport in the early hours of the morning to send off either freight or personnel to minerals and resources projects in the north&hyphen;west of Western Australia and the eastern gold fields.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a technical problem in that a curfew between 12 and six does not prevent stacking, and very many of the early morning flights which currently arrive or go could be stacked between 11 p.m. and midnight and between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. So you would have a process of concentrated activity just before midnight and just after 6 a.m. which, if there is an airport noise problem, does not actually address it properly. A curfew is a blunt instrument which will destroy the economic viability of Perth airport. Frankly, as I have said to the owners of Perth airport, it is just an excuse for poor management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said to the airport owners&mdash;and I have said it publicly&mdash;if the master plan or the development proposal for Perth airport contains a proposal to extend runway 0624, in a manner which is different from that which is currently in the master plan, then as sure as night follows day at some stage at Perth airport you will have a curfew because two things will have occurred. Firstly, the long&hyphen;term planning around the airport will have been put to one side and, secondly, the adverse consequences, so far as noise is concerned by utilising 0624 in a full capacity, will create such adverse consequences that policy makers will not be able to resist the application of a curfew over Perth airport. Perth airport needs to be properly and sensibly managed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9576">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a fifth item in the Perth airport management regime, and that is the configuration between the Pearce RAAF air base and Perth. The member for Swan referred to Jandakot and the potential difficulties which are caused between the configuration of Jandakot to the south and west and Perth airport, but much more difficult is the configuration of Pearce air base and Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you speak to air traffic controllers and Airservices Australia personnel who have to manage the flight paths, what they say to you anecdotally is that you could not have picked a worse configuration. If you were starting again with an empty UBD of Perth and you wanted to come up with the worst configuration of three airports&mdash;a general aviation airport like Jandakot, an international stage 1 main phase airport like Perth and a RAAF base like Pearce&mdash;from an air traffic controller's point of view you could not have picked a worse configuration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most sensible thing that can be done for the long&hyphen;term sustainability of Perth airport is to get on top of, and control, the planning that occurs between Perth airport and the RAAF base. But what has occurred with the RAAF base over preceding years? The planning for the Pearce RAAF base has been done wholly in isolation. It has been done wholly in isolation by the RAAF, by the Department of Defence, with absolutely no heed to that which occurs at Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The time has come to bring the planning of the Pearce RAAF base and Perth airport into a wholly and fully coordinated regime. The utilisation of some of the current Pearce RAAF base by Perth airport for arrivals and departures is one of the most significant things that could be done to substantially diminish, ameliorate and minimise airport noise, particular for those people who live to the north and east of the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most significant thing that airport planners and policy makers can do in the short to medium term is to bring the planning of the Pearce RAAF base and Perth airport into a coordinated regime. That is the most effective thing that can be done to do two things: to ensure the long&hyphen;term viability of Perth airport and to ensure that airport noise is minimised so far as residents are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will come back to that part of the legislation which has serious deleterious consequences for my constituents and the people who live around Perth airport. This bill proposes to remove from the legislation the capacity for interested persons to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the decision of the minister to adopt, in whole or in part, a development plan for Perth airport or any other airport mentioned in the schedules of the airports legislation. That is a right which existed when the airports were privatised. It was a right which existed when the former government, the Labor government, announced that the airports would be privatised. It was a right which existed when the member for Swan voted for the privatisation of the airports. It is now proposed to take it away, at precisely that point in the cycle when it is most relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future for Perth airport is to link Perth to the planning regime adopted around the airport to minimise adverse consequence for residents and to maximise the economic importance of the airport to the state. Continue the long&hyphen;term land use planning by the local authorities around the airport, and continue the current master plan which has been in operation since the mid&hyphen;eighties for a long&hyphen;term parallel runway but with no extension of 0624. Continue to argue forcefully in the community that a curfew over Perth airport is a blunt instrument which does not properly address the problems but which will kill the economic viability of Perth airport. Fourthly, and most importantly, bring the current, uncoordinated planning for the Pearce RAAF 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9577"> base under control and have that properly and centrally coordinated by one regime to ensure the long&hyphen;term viability of Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, Mr Deputy Speaker, when this bill returns to the House for the detailed committee stage I will be strongly supporting the amendments outlined by the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne.</PARA></SPEECH>

Ministerial decisions can be subject to scrutiny by way of the rules of the House and become disallowable instruments tabled in the parliament, where the very people that the community elects have an opportunity in either house to review them by disallowing them; or, of course, we have the judicial review legislation which allows for public appeal and the use of the courts.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The proposal that our party room was advised of is that the change will be from AAT to disallowable instrument. The minister, we are told, will table the determination in the House and, of course, it follows that it is a disallowable instrument. The advantage of that process is that it gives to one house of the parliament&mdash;for instance, the Senate&mdash;the opportunity to override that decision on behalf of the constituency they believe they represent. The realities are that it gives the House of Representatives the opportunity to do it also, where of course the opposition of the day is never very well represented. But the realities are that that opportunity exists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just this morning we had queues of people around the place demanding the continuation of legislation in the Aboriginal area, legislation that opens up thousands of opportunities for litigation. We have $80 million of Aboriginal money that should have been spent on people's health going to lawyers. The same situation applies here. If the parliament can deal with it, why should we leave it to the courts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a trend, which I criticise substantially, of this parliament even to admit with new legislation that they are bringing in a law but they are not really sure what it means but that, no doubt, at some time in the future the courts will tell us. Of course, in the interim, the community walks around not knowing whether it is breaking the law or not. If large amounts of money are involved, as could be so in this case, that is an unsatisfactory situation. All parties are entitled to see these matters cleared up. The fact is that there is still a substantial opportunity for review of the ministerial decision. It is one of the two choices available on this. In fact, it is generally believed that disallowable instrument is the better response, because it is certainly not&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The rationale is efficiency in making it a determination of the parliament, the law&hyphen;makers of this country&mdash;as compared to some unelected judge who sits out there being addressed by lawyers who, in the state of Western Australia, as you would be aware, now charge $25 for every six minutes. That is a huge cost to both sides, a cost which is frequently never recovered. But I do not want to go on with that debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9578">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that the suggestion is that there is no review in the future, but that is wrong. The review will be done in that very appropriate place, the parliament. It is similar of course to the opposition to the freeholding of some of these places. As the member for Swan (Mr Randall) knows very well, prior to the privatisation proposal the FAC was proposing a major commercial development at Perth airport. Personally, I thought it may have had some advantages, but it was going to be extremely disadvantageous to other people who, under the planning provisions of the state government of Western Australia, had invested large amounts of money&mdash;thinking they understood that no other competition was available. Here we have two jurisdictions working side by side whereas, as the member for Swan has already pointed out, once these properties are freeholded they are subject to state law&mdash;although we make it very clear that such freeholding will not occur until there are adequate arrangements in place with state, and state planning, authorities relative to the continued existence of the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter that has been discussed by the last two speakers was Jandakot airport. I was once the holder of a private pilot's licence. I can remember flying down from Carnarvon to Jandakot airport. My overview as we came into land was literally miles of undeveloped bush surrounding this airport. It required almost a map and a water bag to find your way into the city of Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did the planners try and keep that exclusivity? No, everyone wanted to build a house out there. I am astounded that, be it Sydney airport, Perth airport or Jandakot airport, people can complain about the noise when not one of them owned the house before the airport was built there. They all knew what it was about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not tell me that old DC3s were not noisy. I lived next to the Carnarvon airport and I can tell you that, when they got out of the airport, they were still only 150 feet off the ground and the houses used to shake. That was compared to modern jet aircraft, notwithstanding their frequency. That is the matter I want to really address today. The realities are that more and more aircraft are getting quieter and quieter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some rights to make those remarks. I can drive from my house to the Perth airport domestic terminal in 2&half; minutes. It cannot be said of me that I live in some exclusive area miles away from the airport. I live right at the end of one runway. Admittedly, it is not the one that is used most frequently. I know a bit about airports. I find that these people want to destroy the economic arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perth is extremely fortunate to have an airport so conveniently located. It makes it a great attraction to people visiting our city. The member for Perth mentioned the long&hyphen;term potential for a parallel runway. I was one of those that petitioned the then minister, Wal Fife&mdash;another was Peter Shack, whose electorate was significantly affected&mdash;to get the new international airport, which was commenced under the Fraser government and opened by then Prime Minister Hawke, put on the other side of the main runway, so when the second parallel runway is in place the terminals will be between it. It was hoped by many of the local authorities that in time the domestic terminal would shift to there to encourage the construction of the second runway. Geographically that would have been a better situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been quite a lot of planning of Perth airport, because Perth airport does have rural land on the typical approaches and industrial land at the end of the typical departure course. It is pretty well done. It is ridiculous for people to be so silly as to suggest that there should be curfews at that airport, or at Jandakot airport, when each and every house that is being affected today was built long after its construction.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9579">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the minister's second reading speech also mentions some of the issues relating to Sydney airport and particularly how things will be delayed until final decisions are taken about a second major airport for Sydney, such as that proposed at Badgerys Creek. When you have certain responsibilities in this place, you try and expand your knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over a long time since it was first mooted, the idea of a very fast train between Melbourne and Sydney has been something that I believe has great economic and environmental potential. More recently, I wondered if we have ever sat down and done a proper survey of our transport infrastructure&mdash;roads, airports and high&hyphen;speed rail&mdash;as it shifts passengers. What is the opportunity for one to reduce the demand on another?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I cannot put any figures to this House, I have a gut feeling that if an appropriate high&hyphen;speed rail, as is now being considered for Sydney&hyphen;Canberra, was extended to Melbourne, you might not have to build Badgerys Creek airport at all. With that linkage&mdash;and the interconnection and the load sharing you could achieve between Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney&mdash;you might already have sufficient airport infrastructure. You would have an adequate connection. I am talking about the only suitable speed at which that is achievable and that is somewhere around 450 to 500 kilometres an hour. Fortunately, that technology is now available. I have ridden in it. It is the magnetic&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have done 421 kilometres an hour in a train. That is the point I make. Three hundred is about the end of your wheeled technology, once you go into magnetic levitation. I have been in the vehicle&mdash;it is available. I have been on a test track. I have done 421 kilometres an hour in that vehicle, and that was on a 20&hyphen;kilometre track. The main constraint on its speed was getting up and getting down again from those speeds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The realities are that we can have a train service running on a form of monorail, which removes a lot of the disadvantages of resumption of land and some of the other environmental opportunities, operating between Melbourne and Sydney, via Canberra and places like Wollongong and Goulburn. You can have that running at 500 kilometres an hour on existing technology. That is 40 or 50 minutes from Canberra to Sydney, and about two hours from Sydney to Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once you have done that, the demands on the existing airports, with the reduction&mdash;I do not say the annihilation&mdash;of domestic travel, both interstate and intrastate, is the first improvement you get in terms of greater opportunities to compensate international arrivals. The second is that you start to share the international arrivals. Perth is a gateway for traffic from the west and, to a degree, from the north. Melbourne is equally advantageous in that regard, if people could step out of their plane and get onto an extremely comfortable train that would have them in Sydney&mdash;if that was their destination&mdash;in two hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are arguments; they are not facts. But I am hopeful, and I have made representations to the newly appointed Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) that we should really and truly start to consider this. That sort of high&hyphen;speed rail has a freight capacity. It is not a heavy freight capacity, but the sort of items to a great degree that are travelling up and down the Hume Highway, with thousands of trucks every night, could be also on that rail service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of it would travel in the daytime in separate carriages simply because it would be able to be combined with passenger travel. I understand that the carriages could carry about 80 tonnes of freight, which is quite a lot. The idea of getting a lot of that traffic off the Hume 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9580"> Highway would be very attractive to many people in the environmental sense and also, of course, in terms of the maintenance cost of many of those roadways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are prepared&mdash;it just might be something where we look to a bit of bipartisan interest&mdash;we should be sitting down with a joint standing committee of the parliament. I think my particular committee, the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, would be an ideal body to do just that, and say, `How do we interlink road infrastructure, airport infrastructure, and fast rail infrastructure in this highly populated, relatively wealthy south&hyphen;eastern part of Australia to maximise the benefit of both, and reduce particularly the environmental problems that arise today from airports?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I have put points about existing airports and the complaints that people have about them, I cannot put those arguments on the case of a new airport. Quite obviously, the people that live anywhere near where one of them will be built have got a lot of reasons for complaint. It just might be that we have a better option. What is more&mdash;I am sure it would not be long if that happened&mdash;we would see a similar transport system starting to run north of Sydney, where you have a couple of very substantial military airports&mdash;Richmond is one, and I think the other is Waverley.

But the reality is that you have another big block of international&hyphen;style runways&mdash;if not facilities&mdash;that again, if that infrastructure went north, over time, would put Newcastle 20 minutes&mdash;or something&mdash;out of Sydney and, of course, the linkage with those airports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very responsible position that this House should be taking. We have tended to see them in packages: roads is roads; aeroplanes is aeroplanes; and trains&mdash;we have not got any of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to come back to this maglev technology; I have been on the wheeled TGV, too. I take a significant interest in this. Because the power required to move them is on the rails, there is a point at about 300 kilometres an hour when the cost benefits cease and the amount of power you have got to put on the rails actually starts to work against itself. When you go to maglev technology, the power is in the track. You actually have a stator in the track. You can therefore climb a 10-degree grade because when you get to that section of the track, with the same carriage, which carries no motors, you just increase the power of that section of the track. It is an interesting thing. Technically, at least, you also cannot have a collision because, if two trains are on the same section of track, they can only travel in the same direction because the power is in the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is long&hyphen;established technology that has been perfected in recent times, no doubt because of the availability of computerisation. The Germans have got one working. The Japanese are not far behind them. They will parallel the bullet train with this type of technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do you need 500 kilometres per hour? Because the greater the distance, the more competitive in time is an aeroplane. If you have not got those levels of speeds between Melbourne and Sydney, you will not get the passengers. Somebody is suggesting that we should have a tilt train between Canberra and Sydney which, I am advised, would take half an hour less than it would take to drive to Canberra once the road upgrade is completed. That is a recipe for a disaster. Of course, it would never compete with an aeroplane, where 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9581"> probably, central city to central city, you are looking at about an hour. You have got to get that central city to central city time to about the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all the debates we have over airports and the problems they genuinely create for people, I am asking the parliament to think about getting down to the idea of looking at the three together. I would love to think it was viable for my city of Perth, but the population is not there.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one addresses the financial viability of this proposal, one just has to think of the great sporting events that occur every weekend between Melbourne and Sydney today, with AFL competition and so on, and of how many people would move back and forward if they could do the trip in two hours in groups of 1,000. That is the sort of situation that we are confronted with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my mind, it is also the sort of project that we want, to address unemployment and to give the Australian people a bit of confidence that this country has still got a future and can get into this sort of Snowy River project of today. The actual structure is such that it could be a huge help to the steel industry directly. In fact, from the type of structures that are used, it would also employ a lot of unemployed people. The roadway is quite basic structural technology. I have had a look at it; I have taken photographs of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the House to give some consideration to that. I think it is something we should all support. I have had a conversation with the minister and I am sure he understands the logic of my argument. There are many factors to apply and, quite clearly, the research needs to be done to support my arguments. I think it would be a great idea and it could be a huge attraction, even to tourism, with people travelling between those airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were to put in Badgerys Creek at a cost of $3 billion and then put another few billion into all the connecting infrastructure&mdash;albeit fuel pipes or the suburban type of electric trains&mdash;it would be further away in time than Canberra from Sydney.

If those amendments are not successful, the opposition has indicated through the shadow minister that we will be opposing the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R304">Airports Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has moved amendments which would remove the aspect of this bill which would enable the freehold sale of the airports. We are also moving amendments to remove the amendments that take ministerial decisions outside the scope of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We are also concerned about the removal of the existing cross&hyphen;ownership rules relating to Adelaide and Melbourne, Hobart and Launceston, and Coolangatta and Brisbane, along with the cross&hyphen;ownership rules preventing Townsville being owned with Brisbane, and Townsville being owned with Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government, in privatising the airports, was keen to ensure that there were very strong cross&hyphen;ownership provisions to ensure that major airports were not owned by the same operators, and, with regard to the smaller airports, particularly, that local ownership of those airports was encouraged. That has certainly occurred with local government in a number of areas bidding successfully for the ownership of those airports.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9582">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the freehold ownership provision, I think that it certainly should be opposed. One of the concerns that many residents around airports had with the privatisation of the airports was the issue of government regulation. The freehold ownership of the airports would, indeed, in conjunction with this legislation, shift some of the planning control for those airports to state governments. The state governments have indicated that they do not particularly want control over the planning of these airports. Indeed, this bill should be seen as a package, to represent a dilution of regulation of these airports and of the ability of residents around the airports to have an influence on, and a say in, these important issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to concentrate today on my concern about the removal of the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of ministerial decisions. This would apply in a number of areas: to master plans, to environmental plans, and to flight paths. All of those decisions would be removed so that the only right of appeal which residents would have would be to the Federal Court. The Federal Court would be very expensive, and prohibitive for the average resident. In an electorate such as mine, the average resident or, indeed, any residents' groups and community associations simply could not afford to appeal to the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is symptomatic of my concern that the Marrickville council took action against the federal Labor government of the time on behalf of the community to oppose the expansion of facilities at Sydney airport. That was a court action which I supported as a resident and as a local representative. The current government&mdash;the then opposition&mdash;thought that court action was a terrific idea, as well, and encouraged the local council to represent the community's interests. But when Marrickville council lost that particular case, we saw the federal government pursue Marrickville council for the federal government's share of the court costs. It should be acknowledged that Marrickville council quite correctly represented and advanced the views of the community. Under the leadership of Mayor Barry Cotter, they had a responsibility to represent residents' interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is incredible hypocrisy. Before the election we saw John Howard, as the member for Bennelong and not just as the leader of the then opposition, and other members, such as the member for Lowe, Paul Zammit, who was then the candidate for Lowe, purport to be concerned about Sydney airport. Now, the government is doing nothing other than punishing the residents of Marrickville for taking action. It is the ratepayers, the people who have been subjected to an inordinate level of aircraft noise, more so than any other community in this nation, who are forced to pay the costs. It will not come out of the mayor's salary. It will not come out of the deputy mayor's salary. It will mean a further cutback in facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a meeting with the previous minister for transport, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) about a week before his resignation as the minister. He indicated that he was unsympathetic to our cause. I hope to make representations to the incoming Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), and I congratulate him on his elevation to the cabinet. We will be making representations to ensure that the people of Marrickville are not punished for their council's decision to stand up for their community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that highlights the reason why the Administrative Appeals Tribunal appeal needs to be maintained, because what we see at Sydney airport, on every front almost, are issues about which residents are concerned. Firstly, we see the ongoing expansion of facilities at Sydney airport. The previous speaker, the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), raised the issue of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works. The public works committee of this parliament 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9583"> on 19 June 1997 approved the upgrading of the international terminal at Kingsford Smith airport, to the tune of $350 million. The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) announced on the 29 August 1997 that an EIS for this massive expansion of facilities was not required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that we need great details and, indeed, decades of EISs into a second Sydney airport, which of course was first raised by the Chifley government and has been raised ever since by governments but we have seen very little action. But when it comes to a $350 million expansion at Sydney airport, that can just be approved with the tick of a pen by the minister. They are the sorts of decisions which create a great deal of alarm for residents around Sydney airport because, whilst we hear a lot of rhetoric about action, about flight paths and second airports, all that residents see&mdash;and, indeed, all that commuters see every time they go to Sydney airport&mdash;are ever expanding facilities. There are  roads being dug up, terminals being expanded, car parks being built and the rail network being built there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, it is a frightening revelation that there are supporters in the cabinet of a fourth runway for Sydney airport&mdash;a fourth runway which would be parallel to the current east&hyphen;west runway, built into the bay, which would allow for up to 150 movements per hour at Sydney airport. That has supporters not only in the cabinet&mdash;the Treasurer (Mr Costello), I understand&mdash;but also has considerable support, of course, from the airline industry and the FAC, who have opposed any real solution to Sydney airport's difficulties at every possible opportunity. So the removal of these expansion plans from public scrutiny is a retrograde aspect of this bill and something which the opposition is certainly trying to amend today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a member of the Sydney Airport Community Forum and this bill refers to master plans. When we had the first meeting of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, we asked the then head of the FAC at Sydney airport, `What is the master plan? Is there a five&hyphen;year plan or a 10&hyphen;year plan at Kingsford Smith?' We were told that we were not in a position to be advised. We were only the minister's appointed body to represent the community. But we could not be told whether there was a five&hyphen;year plan or a 10&hyphen;plan at Sydney airport. We were deliberately held back from information such as the FAC's involvement in a plan at Rockdale to build a Darling Harbour type development as part of the expansion at Sydney airport. It is that sort of deception which we have seen from the bureaucrats and the industry which causes great concern for the people that I represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to flight paths at Sydney airport, we are going to see the long&hyphen;term operating plan introduced on 4 December. That plan, whilst having some good elements, also has some disastrous elements, the biggest disaster being that there will actually be a decrease of take&hyphen;offs over water under that plan, contrary to the government's commitments prior to the election. There will be an increase in take&hyphen;offs over the north&hyphen;west of my electorate. That is for one reason and for one reason only: the plan favours the North Shore. There has been one thing constant about Sydney airport and that is that, whoever has been in government, there has always been a bias towards landings from the north rather than take&hyphen;offs to the north for the simple reason that that is where the residents are and take&hyphen;offs are a lot noisier than landings. But now we have a proposition that we will restrict the landings from the north because the landings have to come in over a straight line and affect the residents of Bennelong and others on the North Shore of Sydney. We will forget about that and have a preference for take&hyphen;offs to the north which will then spray in four different arcs over the western parts of my electorate, in particular the Ashfield municipality, and all over the electorate of Lowe, contrary to the commitments in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Putting people first</EMPHASIS>, the Liberal policy launched by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the electorate of Lowe, in which he stated that there would be no new flight paths 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9584"> over that part of Sydney. I think that the removal of the right of appeal is something which is indeed a very negative step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think also that residents should have access to appeal over specific problems with the airport. We saw a 747 having to turn back when they had problems with one of their engines just one month ago over Petersham in my electorate. We are talking about the most densely populated area of Australia, not just Sydney. We have seen, and I have drawn to this parliament's attention, the repeated breaches of the fuel dumping provisions over the residents in my electorate. That is something which caused great concern. Due to questions which I asked of the minister, we discovered that, in events on 30 July 1996, 13 August 1996, 15 October 1996 and 14 January 1997, one airline alone, Evergreen Airlines, sprayed fuel all over my electorate and the electorate of Lowe. All of these aircraft were Boeing 747&hyphen;200s. These planes have a capacity to vent approximately 379 litres of fuel&mdash;189.5 litres in each wing&mdash;all over people's houses, their cars, schools, parks and child&hyphen;care centres throughout my electorate. When that occurs, what you need is some government accountability. It took me months to get answers to the questions on notice which I placed in response to residents ringing up my office and putting in complaints about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a range of issues, whether it be the big picture, whether you start with expansion of an airport, whether you look at the flight paths, or whether you look at the specific operations of planes operating from an airport, be it Sydney or any other airport in Australia, you do need provisions which allow residents to have proper scrutiny of ministerial decisions in relation to the operation of those airports. I am greatly concerned that this legislation is very much a retrograde step with regard to that scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude by saying I am a strong supporter of a second Sydney airport to be built at Badgerys Creek in western Sydney. However, I will support that airport only after a proper environmental impact statement has been done because I am not about simply transferring the problem of noise in my electorate to the electorate of anyone else. I do not want anyone to suffer as the people of Sydenham and St Peters have suffered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way to do that is to have proper planning for that second airport. There must be a properly integrated public transport system because the greatest threat to air quality in the Sydney basin will not be from the planes at western Sydney; it will be from the cars taking people to and from that airport. If you have a look at the problems in my electorate, they certainly are not due just to the planes; they are due to the whole environmental impact arising from an airport in the centre of Sydney. You need proper planning at Sydney West airport. You also need to ensure that people will have proper scrutiny provisions available so the disaster that is Kingsford Smith airport is not repeated.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take the opportunity to speak in this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R304">Airports Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . I will start by saying that I subscribe to a magazine called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Airline Business</EMPHASIS> , one of the bibles of commercial aviation around the world. In this month's edition, October 1997, there is an excellent article that is concentrating its focus on the future of Sydney airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), who has just spoken, and any other members who may be interested in this area, should get a copy of this article. It also gives an overview into the privatisation of Australia's airports and an overview of what is happening 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9585"> already in terms of the privatised airports in Brisbane and Melbourne. It describes how the transfer of those airports into private ownership is already rejuvenating the aviation industry in Australia and how it may help the industry reach its full potential as one of the most potent forces in aviation in South&hyphen;East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are discussing today is really stage 2 of that privatisation process, which is one of the biggest airport privatisations ever undertaken in the world. This particular move by this government really has some exciting prospects for new industry, as that article says, and for the realisation of the full effect of Australian aviation in terms of the future development of South&hyphen;East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, privatisation does give some tremendous prospects in terms of local communities and, at last, the freeing of government instrumentalities from the shackles that have inhibited the operation and future expansion of a number of those airports, whether they be capital city airports, regional airports, or some of the local airports that are up for sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that has upset me in the past hour or two, listening to members of the opposition in their presentations today, is simply that they do not seem to have learned very much. I say that because what they are trying to do with these particular amendments that have been proposed is stifle what could at last be a tremendous expansion of new business for aviation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will concentrate very briefly on a couple of points. The reality is that the government foresaw what would happen if those cross&hyphen;ownership provisions were not in place in this particular legislation. There could be no greater example of what an absolute disaster the lack of cross&hyphen;ownership provisions is than would exist if the ownership of Brisbane and Coolangatta were to fall into the same hands. Frankly, I was delighted to see that the Schiphol consortium got ownership of Brisbane airport because Schiphol is one of the most competitive airports in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can see already that the BAA part ownership of Melbourne airport has put competitive forces in there as well. I do not think that there would be much future for Coolangatta airport if the BAA consortium owned both instrumentalities. In fact, it would be a very good proposition to close down Coolangatta, particularly to international traffic, and divert it all through that principal gateway. Apart from that, the other thing that should be considered is the sort of return that we are going to get from these airports if we do not have those provisions on cross&hyphen;ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For six years, I shadowed aviation in opposition. In fact, I did a great deal of work on the privatisation of airports. I have been convinced for some 15 years that it was the way to go but that the one thing that we had to make absolutely sure of was simply the fact that we did not create a private monopoly, and this legislation is going to be such that it will prevent that private monopoly. A number of things came out in all of that work that we did over the years on airport privatisation, but one thing that always impressed me was that Coolangatta airport was probably one of the best investments of the whole lot of the airports that were to be offered for sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The potential of Coolangatta, a small airport, admittedly, is enormous. But its real potential is in limited international flights. Already we have seen what can be achieved by allowing limited international flights into Coolangatta. The advent of Freedom Air and the predecessor from New Zealand is probably a typical example of that. There has been an increase in the figures for New Zealanders holidaying on the Gold Coast over the last couple of years. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9586"> principal reasons for that increase are that we have had that competition and that limited charter operations have been allowed to go in there. The Gold Coast infrastructure has benefited very greatly from the advent of those flights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, the real difficulty is if you allow a situation to exist where there is ownership or even part ownership, which is really what the effect of the opposition's amendments will be. Under the opposition's amendments, the Brisbane airport consortium could own about 15 per cent of Coolangatta. As you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, 15 per cent of the ownership is a pretty influential slice to have and you could in fact see a lot of that competition going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the same could certainly be said if there was similar ownership between Melbourne and Adelaide. Adelaide has always struggled to establish itself as an international gateway and that is fully understandable. But, with the prospect of being in private hands and the right to go out and to compete, there are some opportunities for Adelaide to get some of that limited international traffic, particularly in the charter area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I emphasise the point that the whole thing about this exercise is competition. The one thing that causes me some concern is that while we are going to have these airports open to competition, and while we should have good viable operators being able to go out there and to get the business, the government has to make absolutely certain that the regulatory authorities in Australia allow some of that competition to happen. And, frankly, I do not think our record in this country has been terribly good over the last 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have mouthed all sorts of platitudes about opening up to competition, and the reality is that we have made some progress. Limited charter operators are now allowed into Australia. But, day after day, you hear stories of what has been happening in the International Air Services Commission, the attitudes of the established carriers in Australia. If anybody thinks that there is an open slather market, think again. We have seen real evidence of some of the approaches that have been made by the established international operators over the last couple of years to make sure that their market is maintained as a cosy area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was absolutely surprised to read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on Monday that the IASC had rejected a Qantas application for code sharing rights with British Airways on some of the sectors between Australia and Europe. I really wonder what the authorities are trying to achieve. The whole of the international aviation industry is moving towards these consortia. Qantas is in there with British Airways and American, which is potentially the second biggest consortium. They are going in with Iberia of Spain and I think it is VASP of Brazil to try to give themselves some coverage. On top of that, what is known as the Star Alliance is anchored on carriers like Lufthansa, Singapore Airways and Thai International. I think Delta is in there, too, and that is the world's biggest conglomerate. What are we doing? We are doing our best to make sure that Qantas may not have the full capacity to be able to get in there and share some of this international traffic through this code sharing process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that what is happening in international aviation, and what will continue to happen in international aviation, is that carriers will no longer be national carriers of a particular state in the true sense, but they will be part of blocs. There will be blocs of nations which have banded together and which will be cross&hyphen;selling and cross&hyphen;utilising their equipment to get the most efficient use out of it&mdash;and, indeed, in terms of passenger traffic, to be able to get some real fare benefits out of the arrangements as well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9587">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the move that was made by the IASC, even though it was said to be in the best national interest, is probably not going to work that way at all. If Australia is going to play a part in global international operations, we have got to review our thinking there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, we have to be as liberal as we possibly can in terms of this limited charter traffic that is coming around, particularly from the region of South&hyphen;East Asia. We have to make sure that some of these secondary airports, whether they be capital city or regional airports, have full and open access for those new operators to get in and to provide the traffic in and out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some real evidence at the moment that, while we have in the past traditionally relied on carriers from New Zealand and to a degree from the UK, we are now starting to see the opening up of regional charter traffic from some of the Asian countries. I understand that, to their credit, the IASC has just granted rights to a new Japanese charter carrier which is a division of Japan Air Services, the third carrier in Japan, to start operating some limited charter flights into Brisbane. That has got to be welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing this does, particularly in terms of local ownership, is to give future owners of these airports an opportunity to open up some new industries. Airports are no longer just places where planes land. An airport has become an integrated area that has the capacity to promote great industry, to bring new industries into areas and to revitalise areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you would have a great interest in Alice Springs airport. I think Alice Springs airport has tremendous potential, though not necessarily as a major hub for the arriving and taking off of airline passengers. The physical area of Alice Springs airport is the largest in Australia. If we look at some of the developments that have happened overseas, particularly in the United States, we see that some of the things that can be done in desert conditions in terms of aviation are absolutely enormous, because the environmental conditions there are right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some years ago I went to Mojave, which is in the Mojave Desert about 160 miles outside Los Angeles. Mojave is one of the largest aircraft storage and maintenance bases in the world. At that stage, which was at the time of the downturn of international aviation, there were no fewer than 1,000 passenger aircraft parked in Mojave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reasons they were parked were numerous. There had been a number of carriers in the United States that had gone out of business, and the aircraft were parked there for future sales. There were direct deliveries from some of the major manufacturers of brand new aircraft, who parked them in the desert until business picked up enough to allow them to go. Allied to this, of course, there developed a whole new aircraft maintenance division. Part of it was for the maintenance of these stored aircraft; part of it was for the destruction of the old aircraft and getting parts together as they melted down some of these aeroplanes. It was really an incredible operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The town of Mojave was really like the back of Bourke. There was very little there. It was a tiny settlement. But, out of the move to establish the desert aviation park, a whole new town emerged. The thing about it was that the people who were employed were pretty technically skilled and consequently their incomes were fairly high and, from the midst of nowhere, there developed a tremendous little town that really did make a contribution to the surrounding districts. Because of the fact that one of the US air force's major bases is about 50 or 60 miles away from it, the town also managed to feed off some of the work of that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9588">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at a place like Alice Springs and if you look around South&hyphen;East Asia, you see that there are very few areas where this facility is available. Australia, I think, does have the capability of doing that. Looking around South&hyphen;East Asia now, you see where some of the excess airliners are parked: some are in the jungles of Thailand, which would hardly be conducive to the maintenance of airframes, and others are parked at various airports in the middle of nowhere. We could have the new owners of Alice Springs airport, for example, look at this particular concept, as there is a possibility of bringing in a whole new industry there. Whether it be at Alice Springs, Jandakot, or Archerfield in Brisbane, there is the capacity to be able to create whole new industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, as I said, airports are not just about passengers coming and going. They can be about allied industries and about general industry. One of the things that you will probably see with some of these facilities is that there will be a great deal of general industry generated by the new owners to maximise absolutely the usage of these airport areas. The flow&hyphen;on effect of that into local communities is going to be great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition are also moving amendments in terms of the control of airports. They have stated that they have some opposition and that state governments are not particularly keen on taking over the supervision of some of these newly privatised airports. I can understand that, because the history of local government and state government in airport administration and airport development has been absolutely appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to hear the member for Grayndler make mention of Badgerys Creek and the need for EISs. Badgerys Creek in the mid&hyphen;1980s was a greenfields site. I have had meetings with WESROC and various council members&mdash;a couple of them prominent members who have since served in the House here&mdash;about what they wanted to see for Badgerys Creek, and the potential for Badgerys Creek was enormous. In the construction phase, it would have been about 5,500 jobs. When the airport was finished, it would have been initially about 9,500 jobs for the local residents, as the spin&hyphen;off from all those new industries. And what have we seen? We have seen development approvals for housing estates all over the place. I personally would have some doubts now as to whether you would ever get a Badgerys Creek through an EIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is really one of the great problems that we have had: there has been total and absolute irresponsibility by some of our local authorities and state governments in the way they have regarded this airport development. One of the classic cases is the case of Essendon airport. We have heard the bleatings from governments of Victoria about selling Essendon airport off for more housing estates. Here you have one of the greatest facilities just sitting there. If you get rid of Essendon, where are you going to put a second airport for Melbourne? I guess it is going to be out Cranbourne way. They have already written off Point Cook as a prospective site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at what Essendon provides for that local community, there are maintenance shops and heavy engineering shops around there. To take that out of circulation would be absolutely irresponsible. You have that facility there; it is well&hyphen;established. I think that, with the right ownership and the right management, the potential of Essendon airport to expand and get back to some of its former glory is going to be a very real prospect indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken longer than I intended to. I do get a bit excited about this legislation because I think that we now really have the capacity to be able to get into the world league in terms of the development of our airports and of new high&hyphen;tech aviation facilities in Australia. It has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9589"> the potential not only to create a great deal of export income for us, but also flow&hyphen;on in some real benefits to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bill to the House. I would totally reject the proposed amendments from the opposition. I would sincerely hope that the opposition members would start rethinking some of their attitudes towards the aviation industry because the effect of their amendments would be to stifle the potential for very real gains for all Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Airports Legislation Amendment Bill 1997  is the second phase in the sale of federal airports. The flexibility is allowing some of the remaining airports to be sold on a freehold basis. On the outset, one could become concerned about the fact that governments continue to sell off assets and I am compassionate about a lot of those people's concerns. But people must understand various reforms are necessary to kick&hyphen;start the country and to change the mentality from where people believe that this country and the government owe them something. This is wrong. It is this socialist welfare mentality impressed upon people from the Keating Labor government that has left us where we are today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back to the concerns people have about the sale of assets, I hate to have to admit that, in some cases, privatisation is the only way to make some operations work, as the current work practices entrenched in the workplace stop the operation from ever becoming financially viable. Quoting from the background to the legislation, I think it is absolutely important that people reading this speech have a firm indication of what the legislation was about. On 1 July 1997, the government executed the first phase of the sale of federal airports with the granting of long&hyphen;term leases of major airports at Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Melbourne airport was sold for $1.31 billion to Australia Pacific Airports Corporation, comprising AMP, BAA, Axiom Funds Management and Hastings Fund Management. Brisbane airport was sold for $1.39 billion to Brisbane Airport Corporation Ltd, comprising Amsterdam airport, Commonwealth Bank, Brisbane City Council and the Port of Brisbane Group. Perth airport was sold for $643 million to the Air Australia Development Group, comprising Airport Group Holdings International, Infratil Australia and Hastings Fund Management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Airports sold on a freehold basis must also continue to operate as airports. The legislation we passed some time ago also ensured that individuals and companies buying airports must use the airports for the original intent. It is absolutely important that people know that, although many of these airports are being sold off or into lease, anybody purchasing them will have to use them for their original intent, which is as an airport air facility. That would be somewhat comforting to many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electorate of Capricornia has many options in relation to expanding its use of airports, in particular the need to lengthen the runway at Rockhampton to 3,200 metres. This is in line with the new developments in the Dawson Valley area&mdash;the new Nathan Gorge Dam&mdash;which should soon be coming on line. The proposal has been put forward and funding has, in some ways, already been announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will bring major benefits to the region, particularly overseas exports. We will have the ability to fly out red claw, fruits, vegetables and flowers to overseas countries. It will be an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9590"> incredible boost for the Capricornia region. With that in mind, I do not mind pushing the barrow that it is absolutely important that various areas be expanded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Capricornia electorate has also grown somewhat. It has physically geographically doubled in size and now includes other areas of Longreach, Winton, Aramac and Barcaldine as well. What would significantly benefit that area is an upgrade to the Longreach airport. This will be an addition in line with our infrastructure strategy put in place to help the western part of the new electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to many of the speakers today, I also find it necessary to comment, as did a previous speaker, the member for Fadden (Mr Jull), in relation to the placement of airports. I feel that governments&mdash;local, state or federal&mdash;should also legislate to prevent people purchasing housing land particularly around airports. It is absolutely crazy. As far as airports are concerned, they are usually there in the first place. Yet people move to and want to build housing estates, and those sorts of things, right next to the airports. The airport was there first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely crazy people being able to build right next to them. Then, all of a sudden, they start complaining about the noise factor. I guess this is somewhat human nature, because the land values and the housing values would be cheaper at the time. But, at the end of the day, when the land or houses are sold on, all of a sudden we have the problem of people complaining about airport noise. It leaves us in the exact situation we hear about today with places like Essendon, Sydney, and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not dwell on it. There were only a few points in particular that I wished to make in relation to the Airports Legislation Amendment Bill 1997. I understand the opposition has various amendments. As far as I am concerned, the legislation that is put forward by the coalition government is good, solid legislation. It will go a long way to ensuring that airports around this country, through their privatisation and so forth, will give a benefit, and of course a financial boost, to society.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to you, Mr Chairman. I understand that we are debating cognately the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R354">Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Bill 1997</XREF>  and the package of bills on trust loss and related matters. This package of bills is in fact one of the most important to come before the parliament in the taxation area during the life of this government. It is a little

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do emphasise the importance of the legislation for two reasons. The measures that it contains and that it addresses are necessary, certainly, to improve the equity of the tax system. It is important for another quite different reason. The process leading to the debate today tells us quite a lot about the government's attitude to tax avoidance, in terms of both the timing and sequencing of this legislation and its substantive content. What it tells us is that the government have deliberately chosen not to come down as heavily on tax avoidance as rhetoric would lead us to suspect&mdash;and they might be inclined to do&mdash;and certainly not as heavily as Labor had originally proposed in relation to these particular measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the rhetoric, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has, of course, repeatedly told the parliament that he is going to be tough on tax avoidance. He said on 20 June in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I make it clear on behalf of this government that where anomalies and exemptions are being unfairly exploited they will be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again on 2 September this year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government takes such measures as are required to prevent legitimate taxation liabilities being avoided.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As recently as earlier this month, the rhetoric&mdash;the rhetorical charade, more accurately&mdash;continued on 2 October, when the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government is serious about making sure that corporations&mdash;and, indeed, individuals&mdash;pay their fair share of tax.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Despite these words and a great many others by the Treasurer, these bills certainly do not match that rhetoric. They have, for a start, had an extraordinary career in terms of the delay that has been involved&mdash;I think an almost unprecedented delay&mdash;in bringing them to fruition as a significant piece of anti-avoidance legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government, we recognised the significant problem and we announced a wide ranging package to deal with the abuse of trust losses in the 1995 budget. That announcement was made on 9 May 1995, almost 2&half; years ago. We duly introduced legislation into the parliament later in 1995. The opposition sent the legislation to a Senate committee and achieved its objective of delaying consideration of legislation by the Senate until the election intervened early in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt there were some in the coalition who fervently then hoped that the issue would be dropped after the election. The reasons they might have so hoped will become, I hope, a little clearer in a moment. The issue has not been dropped completely, but there has been an awful lot of ducking and weaving going on, nonetheless, over the last 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After a deafening silence for five months on the issue, we did see an announcement first of all in the 1996 budget, which affirmed that this government would pursue the issue, albeit with modifications. Six months later, draft legislation was released. A further three months later, a subsequent announcement was made in the 1997 budget which contained further changes from the draft legislation released in February. It has now taken a further five months for this legislation to be presented to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was introduced at the end of the last two-week sitting period. The government immediately said that they wished to have a quick passage into the Senate. We are happy to oblige with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9592"> that swift passage of any anti&hyphen;avoidance legislation and we are doing that today. But it is a bit rich for this government to be so demanding, given the extraordinary context in which this bill comes before us&mdash;the context of endless unjustified delays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving aside the history of the bills and the delay issue, let me turn to the more substantial question of the substance of the measures before us. These bills will insert rules into the income tax law to limit the circumstances under which trusts can deduct current year and prior year losses and debt deductions. Labor supports such an approach of limiting the use of losses for these purposes without any reservations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for introducing these limitations is to ensure that the persons who bore the economic effect of the tax losses are the persons who obtain the tax benefits associated with the recouping of those losses against other income. The public policy behind this approach is quite simple and straightforward. People should not be able to avoid their proper tax liabilities by sheltering their income through the use of tax losses incurred by other taxpayers. This has long been accepted in the context of losses incurred by companies. Company losses can only be recouped if the company passes a majority underlying shareholding test, or if the company passes the so&hyphen;called `same business' test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Bearing this in mind, the introduction of a regime to regulate the claiming of losses incurred by trusts is an important and overdue step in securing the direct tax base in Australia. Obviously, the proposed rules that are to apply to the trusts differ somewhat from the regime which applies to companies. However, this generally reflects the differing legal relationships which apply in the case of trusts, rather than a fundamentally different approach to the question of the legitimacy of the recoupment of losses. The key issues now for these bills are not the differences between the treatment of companies and trusts, but rather the treatment within the category of trusts of family trusts&mdash;the treatment under the original proposed Labor legislation, and their treatment now in this legislative package. The press release of the Treasurer of 13 May this year&mdash;press release No. 42&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 10 February 1997, the Government released an exposure draft legislation on trust loss measures. After receiving comments and submissions, <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">the government has decided to modify the draft legislation to restrict its application</EMPHASIS> . The income injection test will not apply where entities and individuals within a family group inject income into a family trust with losses. This modification will have effect from 7.30pm AEST 9 May 1995 . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These words sound innocent enough, perhaps, to someone not familiar with the very complex legislation before us today, but they represent a huge change in the effect of this legislation. Under the original Labor legislation, the income injection rule did not apply to family trusts where a beneficiary of a loss trust introduced income into the trust to be offset against the losses. That concession was allowed because the beneficiary actually bore the economic effect of the loss, as he or she was a beneficiary at the time that the losses were incurred. That was and remains a perfectly appropriate concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However where a family member, for example, a brother or a sister, who is not a beneficiary of the trust injected income into the trust to derive the tax benefit of the losses within the trust and then got the income back tax free, then, under our scheme, these anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions would apply to that scheme. For examples of these two separate situations, I draw the attention of honourable members to page 171 of the explanatory memorandum for Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995, examples 3 and 4, and I seek leave to table the relevant extract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9593">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Mr GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The rules under this proposed legislation that we are dealing with today, by contrast with the 1995 legislation, propose that any member of the family group as defined&mdash;and that includes spouses, children, grandparents, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces and their spouses and, indeed, any entities, like companies, which are wholly owned by any of them&mdash;can inject income into any other family member's trust and thereby gain the benefit of the losses that may have been incurred by that other trust.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, this is a huge change and it is not one that the opposition is happy about. Members should be able to imagine that the wealthy families of Australia where many members of the broader family have significant assets will now be able to traffic in trust losses among themselves, utterly immune from the application of this legislation. They will be largely, if not always completely, exempt from these new provisions. That is simply not fair by any reasonable analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This change is being dressed up as a family friendly change, but it is really a tax avoidance friendly change. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) speaking to Alan Jones on 14 August this year summed it up rather well. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean, it is aggravating in the extreme if you are a PAYE tax battler, you're having your money taken out each week when you hear of people through all sorts of dodges, the cash economy as well as some people at the big end of town not paying their fair share.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For once, Prime Minister, amen to that. The opposition doubts that many PAYE tax battlers are going to be very happy at all to learn about this brand new tax dodge authorised by the government&mdash;the content of this legislation&mdash;now available to the big end of town. Most families will not be able to benefit from these new rorts for family trusts because, of course, ordinary people will not have any connection with a family trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this legislation has not only been delayed in an unprecedented fashion; it has been dramatically watered down in some crucial respects so far as family trusts are concerned. The delay shows a lack of political will, to put it the most gently, on behalf of the government. The watering down shows a lack of fairness and commitment to treating all taxpayers equally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When both of these things occur, the opposition is entitled to ask why. An examination of the pecuniary interests register for ministers and parliamentary secretaries, leave aside members more generally, is very instructive indeed in this regard. It appears that up to 13 ministers and six parliamentary secretaries&mdash;19 altogether; well over half of the whole government front bench&mdash;in fact have some kind of family trust in relation to their immediate family. I say `up to' advisedly because there simply is not sufficient information in a number of cases in relation to the pecuniary interests register to enable a judgment to be unequivocally made that the trust disclosed is in fact a family trust in the accepted sense&mdash;that is, one in which both the trustees and the beneficiaries come from a single family group. Nonetheless, it is apparent, even with that caveat, that family trusts are alive and well in this particular front bench.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as cabinet ministers are concerned, we have: Minister Anderson, with the AJ Robertson Family Trust; Minister Downer, with the Downer Family Trust; Minister Fischer, with the TA Fischer Trust; Minister Hill, with the RD &amp; DM Hill Family Trust; Minister McLachlan, with the McLachlan Kilbride Trust, the JM Lee Trust, which apparently relates to his spouse, and the AA McLachlan Children's Trust; and Attorney&hyphen;General Williams, with the Pied Piper Trust, going to investment and administrative services but, on the face of it, quite likely to be a family trust&mdash;although, as I indicated, one cannot be completely sure of that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9594">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as ministers in the outer ministry are concerned, we have: Minister Ellison disclosing the CM Ellison trust; Minister Herron disclosing the Herron Family Trust; Minister Moylan disclosing the JE Spark Family Trust and the Judi Moylan Family Trust; Senator Parer disclosing the Parer Family Trust; Minister Scott disclosing the Crochdantigh Family Trust; Minister Vanstone, with the Southern Rural Property Trust, which may not be a family trust, I readily acknowledge, but it does seem a likely candidate because of the nature of the investment property involved on the disclosure form; and with Minister Thomson, we have the Peter Thomson Family Provision Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, so far as the parliamentary secretaries are concerned, we have Secretary Abbott, with the Abbott Family Trust and the Tony Abbott Family Trust. We have Senator Brownhill, with what seems to be&mdash;the writing is not quite up to the occasion&mdash;the Millowritz, the Merrilong and the Merrilong Pastoral Co. discretionary trusts, which appear to have the character of family trusts, as I have described them, but may not in practice, on closer examination, I acknowledge. We have Senator Ian Macdonald with the ID Macdonald Family Trust. We have Mr Ronaldson with the MJC &amp; CM Ronaldson Family Trust. We have Senator Tambling, with the Tambling Trust No. 1, and we have Senator Troeth with the Judith Troeth Family Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the sake of completeness, I do add that, on the Labor Party side, the pecuniary interest register does disclose that one of our frontbenchers&mdash;one only&mdash;is the beneficiary of a family trust. But I understand that that person is in the process of changing that status at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The story is a straightforward one. I do not make any point about the illegality, or anything else, of people holding such trusts. But when you are talking about a piece of legislation coming before this parliament which dramatically waters down the impact on family trusts of a major piece of tax avoidance legislation, it is entirely reasonable for the wider community, and us specifically in the opposition, to be asking why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conflict of interest that is involved here screams out for notice and screams out for explanation. The interests of up to six cabinet ministers, up to seven members of the outer ministry and up to six parliamentary secretaries are clearly directly affected by this legislation. There is an issue of conflict of interest involved here and it is one the government really does have to explain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make clear, for the record, that the Treasurer himself appears to have no personal conflict of interest here in the sense that his return discloses no such family trust nor, and I repeat again, is it in any way illegal or wrong for anyone to have a family trust of the kind that I have been describing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is clearly a conflict of interest involved when members of a government, particularly when there are so many of them, are considering such legislation in the cabinet or in the other processes of parliamentary approval. What the opposition would like to know and what the government might, I hope, be inclined to tell us is: did the relevant members of cabinet with family trusts exclude themselves from the consideration of these issues or at the very least make clear the nature of the conflict of their interest when the matter was debated around the cabinet table? In answering that question the government might also tell us whether such a level of conflict of interest is compatible with any government fairly and properly evaluating revenue issues of this kind and whether or not it is compatible with a government acting against what had already been announced by its predecessor to water down significantly a piece of legislation which would have bitten into the kind of financial returns that could be derived from these trusts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9595">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also an interesting question to ask as to how the government proposes to handle this conflict of interest question when it comes into the parliament proper. I know there is no longer the same obligation since the introduction of the register and related matters for people to stand up in parliament and disclose these interests before matters are voted upon, but in all decency one would expect and hope that that would be done on this occasion. The second reading amendment I will move at the conclusion of this speech will give members an opportunity to make their position clear in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister really does, personally, have a lot to answer for on all these matters. One cannot help but raise a quizzical eyebrow as to why it was that the Prime Minister said to a coalition meeting, not in relation to family trusts, but trusts more generally, on 23 September that, as reported in the press of the next day, trusts for small&hyphen; and medium-sized business entities would be okay in the context of the tax reform process. When I challenged him in the House on 1 October on just that issue and whether it was proposed to walk away from the proposal that trusts be treated the same as companies for tax purposes, we had a Prime Minister ducking and weaving and retreating to the general formula that he did not want to do anything to disadvantage the small business community but certainly leaving open the question of there being some differential advantage given to trusts of that character. Again, given the prevalence of trusts, not only family trusts but other kinds of trusts as well, within the ranks of the coalition front bench one cannot help but legitimately ask to what extent are private interest considerations governing this government's consideration of the public policy principles involved in these particular matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the Labor Party going to do about this legislation in the light of this concern that we have? I have to say that legislation of this kind always poses something of a dilemma for responsible oppositions. On the one hand we are, as I hope I have been making very clear, very concerned about the direction which the government has gone in significantly limiting the scope of this bill. We do not support, as I have made clear, these changes to effectively exempt family trusts from the income injection regime. We do know that this will, quite apart from anything else, cost the Commonwealth significant revenue, probably at least tens of millions of dollars each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that respect I say further that many members of the accounting and tax professions have contacted the opposition on various aspects of these bills. Given the extraordinarily protracted history of them and their significant retrospective effect as well as their substantive impact, we have signalled to the industry that we will support a Senate inquiry into the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do want to see the issues explored. In particular, we want to see explored in the Senate inquiry what scope there might be for amendments of the provisions of the present bill, at least so far as the injection of income is concerned. On the other hand, against these sorts of considerations and our very real concern for the legislation, we do recognise that it may well be unreasonable for the Senate, or parliament itself, to now change the rules retrospectively, or at least all the way back to 9 May 1995, to tighten the income injection test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taxpayers have been relying on the more recent public announcements of the Treasurer in respect of this matter. It is also the case that taxpayers and their organisations have been engaged in a long consultation process in good faith. It may well, under these circumstances, be unreasonable to change the rules significantly with retrospective effect. It is part of the dilemma that is always associated with tax legislation by press release, but it is a dilemma that affects every government, not just this one.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9596">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other consideration that the opposition has to bear in mind is that we do regard the passage of this legislation, overall, as generally very desirable despite the particular problems that I have been focussing on today. It is the case that around $500 million in revenue is expected from these bills over the four years until 1998&hyphen;99. We certainly do not want to put that revenue at risk by trying to fix up the equity of one piece of the legislation but then perhaps have the government walk away from the legislation altogether as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subject to further consideration by the opposition in the context of what might emerge from the Senate inquiry, I indicate today that Labor will not be opposing the bill in its present form in the House of Representatives and we are not likely to seek to oppose it in the Senate. However, we certainly will be reviewing the operation of these rules when we come back to government, sooner now rather than later, with a view to tightening this legislation to ensure that all avoidance is stamped out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make no bones about making very clear our intention to home in on this particular area in exactly the same way that we did in 1995. It is very difficult to embark upon these courses, particularly complex amendments, complex tax legislation, when you are in opposition, but when you are in government it is a different story, and it will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a few general points I would like to make about the tax debate because I think the opposition's position and the extent to which we have been cooperative in the enterprise of tax reform has perhaps not significantly been acknowledged. The government is currently undertaking, as we all know, a secret bureaucratic exercise, crunching the numbers, to develop various options for tax reform. It has refused our invitation to make that information public so that the public at large, and we in particular, can be well informed of the actual options and make some intelligent choices, or better informed choices, accordingly. We will always make intelligent ones, but a little bit more information helps. The government, however, pretends that Labor is against reform and that it is turning its back on the whole reform process. Nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only basic change that we have ruled out, and we have ruled it out absolutely, is the adoption of a GST. That has infuriated the government because as we have always known, the implementation of a GST is the only real objective of this whole exercise. That was a point that was confirmed by the thrust of the speech by the Treasurer to the MTIA earlier this week, a limp and lacklustre speech though it was and for which the applause in unprecedented fashion died away by the time he had left the platform, quite apart from by the time he had actually reached his seat. I hope that the Treasurer derived some message from the deafening silence with which his approach to these matters was greeted on that occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has taken the position of not attempting in any way to derail the reform task force procedure. We have not availed ourselves of the many opportunities that there have been over the last few months to beat up issues, and neither have we sought to use the procedures of this parliament to delay or frustrate important tax matters which have arisen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give some examples of this to buttress the point. For a start, the resolution of the half decade long problem concerning the impact of the petroleum resource rent tax on Victoria was dealt with cooperatively by me with the Treasurer, exactly as it should have been on an issue of that significance, that is, on a completely apolitical basis. The necessary legislation was dealt with very swiftly in the national interest. No attempt was made by us to derail the settlement or misinform the public.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9597">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second example I give goes to the aftermath of the Ha and Lim and Walter Hammond judgments where, as we will all recall from recent memory, a fiscal crisis arose for the states and territories. Around a sixth of the revenue base of these governments was eliminated by that High Court case and the prospect of gigantic repayments of past tax collections loomed. Here surely was a heaven&hyphen;sent opportunity for politics to override the governance and for the opposition to wreak a degree of havoc. A huge tax rescue package of around one per cent of GDP was needed quickly to sure up confidence and the financial position of the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again I remind the government and public that we gave the legislation immediate passage through both houses of parliament because it was indisputably in the national interest to do so. The government bungled the compensation payments issue arising from new safety net arrangements so badly that the Queensland situation was only solved last week. We had a few things to say about that on the way through but we did not in any way undermine that process, even though there were many opportunities to do so. Again, I make the point that all the other tax bills which have come before this parliament in the term of this government dealing with tax avoidance have been passed without demur or delay by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this week, a bill tightening the rules concerning foreign source income was passed with full opposition support through the Senate. There is also another tax bill before the Senate at the moment,  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 , which contains a number of important anti&hyphen;avoidance measures including the very difficult one of ensuring that charitable trusts are not used as vehicles for tax avoidance. Honourable members from a number of causes will probably recall receiving representations from charities and other religious and community groups concerned that the initial draft of this legislation was drawn too widely and would have impacted on the legitimate activities of those important bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although there was an opportunity to make some play of all of this, the opposition, supporting the principle of clamping down on illegitimate tax avoidance, took the decision not to play that political game but rather to support the proper tightening of the net while at the same time ensuring that bona fide charities are not detrimentally affected. I would submit that that is about as good a record on tax avoidance issues as any opposition has had in recent decades, at least, certainly in my memory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I contrast our cooperative stance with the various coalition oppositions over the last 13 years where every decent tax measure that I can recall&mdash;including capital gains tax, the fringe benefits tax, the proper tax of foreign source income and improving the equity of retirement benefit taxation&mdash;was opposed root and branch. I note the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) busily scribbling as he wants to leap back into the fray on some of those issues. The point is that those opposite have had an ample record over the years, particularly their years in opposition, as wreckers of decent tax reform. That has not been the case for us. We come to the tax reform debate, as with everything else, with completely clean hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I make, it will have to be pretty briskly, is that a number of holes in the tax base have been introduced by this present government, which really do point up the breathtaking hypocrisy of claims of the kind that continue to be made that we are not interested in the reform or renovation of the tax system. Rather than shoring up the base, the government has introduced, for a start, a whole raft of concessions including the family tax initiative of around $1 billion a year; the health insurance rebate of around $600 million a year; the tax rebate for wealthy self&hyphen;funded retirees worth $70 million a year; the capital gains tax 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9598"> concessions for small business worth about $400 million; and a further $50 million in fringe benefits tax concessions. Many of these are individually defensible, of course, in policy terms, but, cumulatively, they add up to a huge impact on the tax base: in fact, around $2 billion per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Add to that the indefensible and ludicrous savings rebate proposal, which is going to cost a further $2 billion within a very short time, and you have got an example of just what kind of difficulties this government is getting into as it attacks various aspects of the tax base rather than broadening it in order to make life easier for everybody else. This bill before us provides a further example of a hole being deliberately made or at least being deliberately left open which will facilitate the lower payment of tax by those with considerable opportunity to make their proper contribution to the community. I am referring again, in particular, to the quarantining job that has been done for take home payers on family trust situations. Accordingly, I conclude by moving a second reading amendment which has been circulated in my name.</PARA>

So much for hypocrisy, which is a word the shadow Treasurer also tried to use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very large hole in the tax system. We actually still let people keep about 60 per cent of the money. I am sure that worries the opposition no end. But when we seek to tax people, we have to look at principles that are fair. We have to look at what is actually going on and whether, for instance, something like a trust is initially designed as a tax avoidance measure or is put there for other purposes. The reality, and the fact, is that if a person or a family today has some assets of a tangible nature, it is almost imperative that they have a trust structure to protect those assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great problems of today relate to marriage break&hyphen;up and all sorts of things that can put family assets, created by past generations or by living older generations, at great risk. Many people have entered into trust arrangements to guarantee the protection and the transition of those particular properties. There is nothing wrong with that. They are not in the business of dodging tax. For many in our present economic circumstances, they have very few worries about tax because they are not making any profits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear the shadow Treasurer today complaining about a family member gaining a tax deduction because that person has put some of his or her own taxable income back into the family trust because the trust has made losses. A loss is a loss is a loss. There is a suggestion that in every case this money is fed in and passed back. I bet it is! The bank manager will not allow that to happen, because it frequently goes in to pay off the debts that the trust company has accumulated by making trading losses. It does not come back. I am not sure where there would be a small family trust where the money would be returned, if it was put in there to cover losses. It is put in there to cover creditors, or it is put in there to repay the bank, and it is not available for repayment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a family member contributes more money to a trust so that, for instance, those battling creditors can be paid or so that the bank debt can be reduced, why should that family member not get a tax deduction? They have lost the money. If you say that you want to prevent some recycling process whereby that occurs, you had better identify it. But the reality is that it does not happen or that it happens on few occasions. What are we getting pushed around on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have said that a family trust is a very special organisation. What are its tax benefits in the broader sense? It, as a trust, does not attract taxation. All the profits, if they exist, that are available to it must be distributed and they are taxed in the hands of the beneficiaries. We are told it would be much better if they were treated as companies; but companies cannot give the level of protection that I just mentioned for family assets which need to be protected from outside problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But how does a company work? The company pays the tax, and the beneficiary&mdash;otherwise known as a shareholder&mdash;does not. In net terms, where is the great benefit that is going to accrue to the revenue? It is not going to, except for one thing. Of course the Labor Party are very conscious of this, and they did it everywhere they could: there is a small advantage&mdash;where profits exist&mdash;of bringing the taxation revenue forward. The Labor Party did that wherever they possibly could, and the outcome was that further and further pressure was put 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9600"> on small family businesses to pay their tax sooner and sooner and, of course, the reality is that they did not have money to expand their business&mdash;and we wonder why today they are not creating the employment that they did in the past!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us get back to where we stand, because the shadow Treasurer also complained bitterly about our not inviting the Labor Party into our policy preparation. I must go back through my 17 years here to see when we ever got such an invitation from them. It would be fairly unique. In fact, it would have been a case of `"Come into my parlour," said the spider to the fly.' They probably would have given us some bung documents. But the realities are that&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can have any example you like, but do not ever be so silly. It is up to you. I welcome it, because I think fools are to be found in many places and I have just been looking at a couple. The facts of life are, of course, that when it comes to revenue collection there are some requirements. The first is that those from whom you want the revenue have to have made the profit. We keep getting these wonderful pictures painted by the tax commissioner. The member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who was the Treasurer at the time, told us at the last election that he had the perfect solution to the revenue problem. The tax commissioner had told him he was going to collect $800 million from 100 taxpayers who were apparently using the trust system to avoid $800 million per year in tax. How much did we get? The legislation passed; we got nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That tax provision has been available to the Commissioner of Taxation since the announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Costello). The realities are that he got nothing and he will get half of that in terms of what small business could provide. Small business does not pay much tax because it is not making much money. It battles and struggles away. It still has accumulated losses relating to the recession we had to have&mdash;remember that one&mdash;when people were driven out of business in their thousands. These are the arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no money of substance and substantial amounts of revenue available. More importantly, there is the suggestion that where there is an outstanding loan and some revenue injected into the trust by an individual family member, who may have other income by way of salary or profits from an outside investment, that is not a legitimate expense on 95 per cent at least of the occasions and it would be money lost forever. It is not a tax scam. It is propping up the family business and people clearly should, as we have said, be able to obtain a tax deduction. If, sometime in the future, they get a payment, they will pay tax on it. There is nothing wrong with that. That is when the business makes money. But if the business is losing money, what is wrong with people who inject money gaining the benefit of the tax deduction? In fact, we are really talking about artificial ways of raising taxation&mdash;wrong ones. A loss is a loss is a loss. That is the way it should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We get a few promises also from the shadow Treasurer. Even in this regard, they will review this law. It is a promise they might keep because they do not like small business. Why would you believe the Labor Party on anything it said about tax? Why would you even believe that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9601"> their current political campaign against the GST would not be turned over the day they got elected because they wanted the money?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all on the record. I am not speculating. Those letters l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w are burned on my brain. I saw the then Prime Minister attack the media and say, `Of course, we will give this tax deduction to the Australian people. It's l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w.' And what did the Labor Party do? They never got a penny of it. Then you started to rationalise it away in schemes that were never going to work, and that was probably worse. You should have just come in straightaway and said, `We never intended to do it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On tax, you told the Australian people that you could manage the economy, you could fix up whatever. The Labor Party have now made a promise about nursing homes. Why believe them on that? But, of course, they will materialise money. They will get $800 million from some very rich people they say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They said in 1993 they would not increase any taxes to manage their program. And what happened? Six cents a litre on fuel flowed throughout the economy to every item that the pensioner bought in the supermarket, flowed through as a massive disincentive to our car manufacturers and everybody else who had to pay that to produce these vehicles. That is what a VAT is all about. What did they do? They put an extra 2c above that on leaded petrol. It is well known who owns cars that consume leaded petrol&mdash;it is the battlers. Then they put two per cent on wholesale sales tax. That is how dishonest they were to the Australian people. We could not even trust your word if you said you were going to put taxes up, let alone put them down and adjust things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your attitude to this legislation is totally anti&hyphen;small business. They are outside the net of union domination and you do not like them. They do not make large amounts of money. The trust structure is there to ensure that their assets can be protected and it does not prevent them from paying any tax that they could not achieve by other means, including partnerships. But partnerships and companies do not give that protection to family assets which are so necessary today.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9602"> taxes. And where does that always happen? On PAYE people, because they cannot escape. The people of the western suburbs and Frankston, and other parts of our big cities, will see their $400 a week being further eroded while they are trying to pay off a mortgage and while they are trying to educate their kids.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who are the beneficiaries they have been speaking of in the last couple of days? The residents of nursing homes in Rose Bay! I have been there only once&mdash;to the most expensive restaurant I have ever been to. There are million dollar houses. What a joke! But go back through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and find one reference to a nursing home in the western suburbs where, of course, most people will not pay any bond at all. They will still get accommodation, and they will be looked after as they should. But for pure political advantage, considering the structure of its constituency, the Labor Party stands up and argues this case. Someone sold a house in Sydney the other day for $14 million. Under Labor's law, which they are defending with a passion, that person would have a free ride into a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can you substantiate that and then say, `We'll get it out of the tax system'? They get up in here day after day and say, `Big business doesn't pay any tax. But we'll get it out of the tax system.' In other words, it will be a bit more of a load on the PAYE mob. They will be giving us a quote on Toorak today. You check the record; not one word, and this is the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the same with small business. They are not the wealthy people of Australia. Their incomes are not high. In fact, on many occasions, the wages they struggle to pay every week are about 90 per cent of their revenue. They take home less than most of their individual employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are you running around trying to cut them off and telling them that, if one of their relatives is prepared to invest a bit of money in their business to keep it solvent, you will not give them a tax deduction? It is just so silly. What we have proposed is quite proper. I am very critical of the campaign&mdash;I will go on the record about this&mdash;of Mr Carmody, because I do not think the money is there other than, as I said, the biddy might get in six months earlier, again at great cost to certain people, and drive some of them out of their trust structures with other outside effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the reasons the legislation comes in the form it does. It does set out to prevent certain activities where trusts were probably used to avoid taxation. For goodness sake, the shadow Treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), chose to read out a list of the trust holdings of some members of cabinet. I have already mentioned John Dawkins. He was capitalising interests so he did not have to pay tax. Based on his affairs, he would have made a fortune as a tax adviser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not ever think&mdash;as you learnt the other day when you attacked certain people in other areas&mdash;that your own side is not in the business of tax avoidance. They liquidated a company to get the money out tax free. It is all on the record. Do not dare stand up here and pontificate about those nasty small businessmen who might, by putting more money back into their trust, gain a tax deduction when, in nearly all cases, they will never get the money back. If they do, they will pay tax on it. Surely, that is the principle that applies to taxation. When people make a profit, they pay tax. If by some act, they compensate a loss, they have made a loss. If they use other revenue, why should they pay PAYE on some money when they are going to invest it, or put it back in a business, to cover a loss? It is simple arithmetic.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9603">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last 20 seconds, I will say something about cooperative stances. A VAT takes the burden off the people that builds in from the iron ore mine right down to the delivery door of the taxes that build into our manufactured cost. In a global economy, while we build taxes into manufactured costs, as we most definitely do, we are destroying people's chances to have jobs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has given us a great address in favour of tax avoidance and that is not surprising. As he has a trust of his own, it is not surprising that he should be on the side of the tax avoiders rather than on the side of ordinary PAYE taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He asks us: why should trusts be taxed in the same way as companies are taxed? I will come to this as an issue in a moment. He also asked us: what is wrong with someone, apart from immediate family, injecting money into a trust and then being able to get the tax benefit from it? The point here is that Labor has no problem with those who are beneficiaries of a trust&mdash;with those family members who are part of a family trust&mdash;being able to get the benefit of income injections because, where these are being offset against losses, it is they who have to carry the losses. Clearly, if you have someone who is outside that immediate family trust structure&mdash;such as a brother or another relative&mdash;if that person is allowed to inject income into the trust and then say, `That income can be offset against the tax losses of that trust' that opens up the prospect for tax avoidance, for tax abuses and for rorts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for O'Connor raised the issue: why should trusts be taxed in the same way as companies? I would like to draw his attention to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 25 September. In the Chanticleer column, Ivor Ries says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Howard's decision not to mount a crackdown on trusts used by family businesses will be sold to the public as a concession to the `battlers' of the small business world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the reverse is true. The decision to allow some businesses to minimise or avoid tax entirely (because they operate through trusts) while the bulk of the small business community operates through companies (and pay corporate tax), is blatantly unfair, discriminatory and can only further erode faith in the equity of the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's a shocking, retrograde and gutless move. Howard should be forced to impose a level tax playing field for all small and medium&hyphen;sized businesses, regardless of the legal vehicle they use to operate a business. At present only the smarties and hard core avoiders are winning.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I also draw the member for O'Connor's attention to the speech of Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody in recent times. Michael Carmody pointed out that the present arrangements allowed one wealthy individual to collect $19 million tax free in one year. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS> stated that Mr Carmody said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a strong case to tax some or all trusts in the same way as companies, a move which officials believe could deliver hundreds of millions, possibly $1 billion, in extra revenue to the government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He further went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was not fair that some people could pay no tax on profits that they took out of trusts, while investors in business, including mum&hyphen;and&hyphen;dad shareholders, paid tax on "equivalent proceeds".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He gave these examples: $19 million taken out of trusts by one person who paid no tax on them whatsoever&mdash;notwithstanding the belief of the honourable member for O'Connor; and another collecting $5 million a year tax free over at least three years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9604">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent figures show there are some 367,000 trusts, 495,000 companies and 580,000 business partnerships in Australia as of 1994&hyphen;95. So it is a major matter in terms of Australia's taxation system and the equity and efficiency of that system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take the House to some of the remarks made by Michael Carmody in that address. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a broader fairness level, why should a person who invests in a business conducted through a trust and sees the value of the business increase be able to take out proceeds free of tax where the ordinary investor, whose ability to invest in business is generally limited to share purchases, pays tax on equivalent proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Is that a fair system? Is that one that has integrity? Are they not reasonable questions for us to raise? He goes on to express some concern about the use of trusts by wealthy individuals for property development purposes. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These groups commonly state that they are in the business of buying, developing and renting properties, but are not in the business of selling the properties. As a result, the profits on the sale of properties are generally not being returned as income.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So he identifies a number of common features of these property development groups. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The groups arrange their affairs so that one trust or company owns, develops and sells only a few properties. In some groups every new property is developed via a separate entity, usually a trust. Second, that the structure of the property development groups appears to feature multiple layers of trusts companies and a number of single purpose entities. Third, that the trusts are generally companies under the direct or indirect control of the wealthy individual. Fourth, that the group centralise their financing arrangements in a banking entity within the group. And fifth, that generally there are substantial losses predominantly from interest expenses within the groups to offset assessable receipts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Using that kind of device, we see high wealth individuals in Australia today avoiding paying their fair share of tax obligations and, regrettably, the government shows a reluctance to get into this area. It says that the tax base has broken down; it is irreparable; nothing can be done about it, and we have to introduce GST. Whereas, the fact is that the government is not fair dinkum. It is not really trying as far as tax avoidance is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package of bills is important on two counts: firstly, because the measures it contains are necessary to improve the equity of the tax system and, secondly, because the process leading to the bills before the House is indicative of the approach of this government in dealing with tax avoidance issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has chosen to come down lightly on tax avoidance compared with Labor's original proposal of 1995. This is despite the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has repeatedly told the House that he is tough on tax avoidance&mdash;and a few quotes suffice to demonstrate that. On 20 June 1996 the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I make it clear on behalf of this government that where anomalies and exemptions are being unfairly exploited, they will be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 2 September this year he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government takes such measures as are required to prevent legitimate taxation liabilities being avoided.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Earlier this month, on 2 October, he continued this little rhetorical charade, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government is serious about making sure that corporations and, indeed, individuals pay their fair share of tax.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet despite these words, and many others from the Treasurer, these bills have had an extraordinarily long period of gestation in coming before the parliament. Labor had recognised 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9605"> trafficking in trust losses as a significant problem and back on 9 May 1995, almost 2&half; years ago, we announced a wide&hyphen;ranging package of measures to deal with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We introduced that legislation into the parliament in 1995. The opposition sent the legislation off to a Senate committee and they achieved their objective of delaying consideration of the legislation by the Senate until the election intervened. They were not fair dinkum about balancing the books. They were not at all interested in protecting the revenue when they were in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt there were some in the coalition who hoped that the issue would be dropped after the election. It certainly got moved into the slow lane. After a deafening silence of five months on the issue, we saw an announcement in the 1996 budget which said that the government would pursue it, but with modifications. We had to wait another six months before we saw the draft legislation. We had to wait a further three months before we got a subsequent announcement, in the 1997 budget, that there would be further changes to the legislation, and five more months before the legislation has come before the House. Ironically, given that it was introduced at the end of the last two&hyphen;week sitting period, we have the government immediately demanding a quick passage into and through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is in fact happy to oblige with the swift passage of anti&hyphen;avoidance legislation, as we are doing today&mdash;you can see that the thing is being debated in the Main Committee. But it is just a bit rich for this government, having seen the legislation first in 1995, to come into the parliament now and demand that the bill be fast&hyphen;tracked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to make a few remarks about the general issue of tax reform. The government is not prepared to make its work on tax reform public, but it says that Labor is against tax reform. What honourable members need to understand, and the public needs to understand, is that there is a lot more to tax reform than GST. But the government is not interested in that. They say, `We are in favour of tax reform.' But when you come to them and say, `What do you mean? What do you propose?' it is GST. When we say, `We are against GST. We don't support GST. What else are you interested in?' there is nothing else. In their view, tax reform is the same as GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer has said that all tax options are on the table, everything will be considered by the government. But when you listen to the government, particularly the Treasurer in question time on issues such as death duties, it is blindingly obvious that the coalition themselves have ruled out many taxation option issues. So there is not, in fact, any open&hyphen;minded approach to the revenue issues by this government, merely a cynical attempt to mislead those in the Australian community such as the welfare sector, ACOSS, churches, and so on, into thinking that they are fair dinkum about broad&hyphen;ranging tax reform, when they are only interested in GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has not attempted to derail the reform task force procedure, nor have we sought to use the procedures of the parliament to delay or frustrate important tax matters that have arisen. We have had some examples come through the parliament in recent times. We had resolution of the half decade long problem concerning the impact of the petroleum resource rent tax on Victoria. That was dealt with by the shadow Treasurer and the Treasurer on a completely apolitical basis. The legislation was dealt with swiftly in the national interest. No attempt was made to derail the settlement or to misinform the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, we also had the Ha and Lim and Walter Hammond judgments concerning business franchise fees for petroleum, alcohol and cigarettes. Following those judgments, there was a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9606"> fiscal crisis for the states and territories. Those decisions threatened about a sixth of the revenue base of those governments, and the prospect of gigantic repayments of past tax collections loomed. But, once again, the opposition gave the federal legislation immediate passage through both houses of this parliament because it was in the national interest to do so. I note that the government bungled the compensation payments issue arising from the new safety net arrangements so badly that the Queensland situation was only resolved last week. But, again, federal Labor did not in any way undermine that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> All of the other bills dealing with tax avoidance which have come before this parliament during the term of this government have been passed by the opposition. Just earlier this week, a bill tightening the rules for foreign source income was passed with full opposition support through the Senate. There is also another tax bill before the Senate at present&mdash; Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 . That contains some important anti&hyphen;avoidance measures, including the issue of ensuring that charitable trusts are not used as vehicles for tax avoidance. Once again, the opposition has played a responsible role. We have not been endeavouring to play a political game. We have endeavoured to support the proper tightening of the net, while ensuring that bona fide charities are not detrimentally affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the strongest record on taxation issues that any opposition has had for many years and it ought to be contrasted with the government's record on tax reform during their 13 years in opposition. They opposed every decent measure&mdash;capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, proper taxation of foreign source income, improving the equity of retirement benefit taxation and all those things. The Liberal Party were the wreckers of decent tax reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, we find that we have a government which says we need to broaden the tax base. That is their argument in favour of GST: we need to broaden the tax base. And yet, at the same time, it has introduced concessions which have undermined the tax base. We have what is described as family tax initiative, worth a billion dollars a year; health insurance rebate, worth around $600 million a year; capital gains tax concessions for business, worth almost $400 million a year; and another $50 million a year in fringe benefits tax concessions. Those concessions alone are of the order of $2 billion per year and you have also got a savings rebate proposal which will cost a further $2 billion a year within a few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After only two budgets, the Treasurer has punched a $4 billion hole in the income tax base of the nation. At the same time, he runs around saying, `Oh, the base is broken and marginal tax rates are too high, so we're going to have to hit all those families out there with a GST.' People who now do not have to pay tax on food are going to have to pay it. They are going to have to pay the tax on clothing, on haircuts and on visits to sport and entertainment. They are going to have pay an extra tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides a further example of a hole being deliberately made, or at least deliberately left open, which will facilitate payment of less tax by those who are best off. By definition, battlers generally do not have trusts. For the very few that do have trusts, by definition those trusts do not have substantial assets in them. It is clear that the government does not intend to seriously crack down on tax avoidance via trusts. It was clear from the assurances of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) given to the party room that the government was not going to, in his words, significantly disadvantage the small business community. But, as I made clear before, there are many in small business who are paying company tax rates on their income and they are missing out as a result of others who are managing to avoid their fair share of tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was speaking in support of the second reading amendment moved by the opposition. It may be helpful simply to recap by reiterating the significance of that amendment. It says, firstly, the House should condemn the government for the delay in introducing this important legislation; secondly, for watering down Labor's fair approach to stopping trafficking in trust losses; thirdly, for reducing the equity of the Australian taxation system by providing tax benefits to wealthy families which are not available to ordinary PAYE taxpayers and, fourthly, acting inconsistently with its stated tax reform aim of broadening the direct tax base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a situation where the government has watered down the legislation which Labor introduced in 1995 and which they failed to pass. As a result of this, you will find that family trusts will continue to be used as a vehicle for tax avoidance, where relatives who are not part of the immediate family and do not have to be involved in any losses under the ordinary family trust structure are able to inject income into those family trusts and avoid paying tax as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe there is no equity about that. We do not think that it helps the government maintain this nation's income tax base. We are highly critical of the government for not engaging in a serious crackdown on tax avoidance which would enable the income tax base to be protected. We think it is highly hypocritical of the government, through legislation such as this and other measures which have come before the parliament, to allow holes to remain and develop and to make some holes of its own in the nation's income tax base, and then come back to the people of Australia and say, `The tax base is in shreds; what we require is a GST.' As I indicated before, a GST is going to impact on those who can least afford it. It will involve taxes on food; it will involve taxes on clothing; it will involve taxes on people who want to be involved in sporting functions, entertainment and things of that nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will hit older people severely. They are people who have gone into the work force, worked all their lives under a regime of relatively high income taxes and relatively low sales taxes. They are not able to go back into the work force and earn more money. It will also impact on small businesses who will have to act as tax collectors in circumstances where presently they do not have to be involved in the sales tax regime. I commend the opposition's amendment to the House and urge that all members support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill is similar to the bill proposed by the previous government in its 1995&hyphen;1996 budget. At that time it sought to deal with the big end of town. All these millionaires were supposed to be able to contribute $800 million to Labor's bottom line. Not surprisingly, given Labor's floundering around in this area, these gains were never achieved. The gains sought by these bills are in the order of $75 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is something that Labor failed to grasp in the 35 years that it drove business offshore. In that time it made our local businesses less profitable and allowed permanent jobs to fall away and be replaced by unsure casual placements as business doubted its future in this country. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9608"> It is fundamental that you must be able to make a profit in this country to attract business. You cannot seek to tax people out of existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By seeking those at the big end of town, you effectively allow them to renegotiate their legal status and take advantage of some other tax minimising scheme. However, small businesses do not have that advantage and, by introducing draconian legislation, which Labor sought to do, it was simply going to hit small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been made of the taxpayer who made $90 million and paid one per cent tax. That is still a lot more tax than I paid this year, and I am in the top 15 per cent of money earners in this country. Frequently, by seeking 36 per cent of everything, we end up with no investment, no jobs, no circulation of wealth, no R&amp;D, and loss of world standings in health, standards of living and share of offshore markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ireland, on the other hand, has set in place a tax structure guaranteeing 10 per cent company tax for new investment in information technology until the year 2010, and this was done by a united front. With that stable tax regime in place, 40 per cent of US investment in Europe in the last year went to Ireland. That is what we can achieve with cooperation from both sides on the issue of tax reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contribution of the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) to the tax reform debate was to reiterate that Labor opposes a GST. In other words, they want the same tax regime which they had spent 13 years developing, and which they had in place when they left government. They are not interested in tax reform. He carps about the family tax initiative, the health insurance rebate, the savings rebate and the capital gains tax relief for small business eating into our tax base to the tune of $4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me inform the member for Wills that the residents of Lindsay who qualify for those tax breaks&mdash;those on low incomes, those blue&hyphen;collar battlers that Labor has for so many years said that it represented&mdash;are really grateful for the $1,000 per annum that those rebates represent in their pockets, and not in the pocket of a government which continually spent more than it took in consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it that a person on $30,000 a year, with three kids, has less disposable income than someone in a similar position on welfare? Is it unreasonable for someone who works 40 hours a week to demand to be $100, $200 or $300 better off than someone who does not? With significant tax reform, this can happen. But the opposition is not interested in talking about tax reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What if you do not pay any tax after the age of 65? Wouldn't that please our ageing population, considering that we are getting more and more elderly? What if there was no provisional tax? Wouldn't that please our small businesses? Yet, those opposite do not want to be part of any tax reform discussion. They do not want to provide a regime like Ireland's, they do not want to encourage investment, and they do not want permanent jobs growth. They are not looking at anywhere where the government can save money and offer any sort of tax relief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, they say, `We don't want a GST.' That is their entire contribution to the tax debate&mdash;`We don't want a GST.' I caution against a move away from the PAYE tax base in the modern era. The thing about a GST is that the `S' stands for services, and most services into the next century are able to be transmitted down a telephone wire from anywhere in the world: banking services, finance services, travel services, legal services, architectural services, computer software, network maintenance, education&mdash;you can get a degree from Harvard

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world is our oyster but, if Labor continues down the track that Australia resoundingly rejected on 2 March 1996, we will not be at the table of the world's feasts. We will be the waiters, the bus boys and the shoe shines at that feast. This bill seeks to protect our tax base and seeks to close loopholes in the structure of trusts whereby trusts can deduct current year and prior year losses, especially where the owners of the trust at the time of the loss are not the owners taking advantage of the tax break.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not designed to strangle small business, and that has been assured to us in the party room and at the committee stages of this bill. I hope the tax commissioner takes note of that intention when making public rulings on this bill. Why is it that Michael Carmody can interpret legislation without a court room and without reference to this place for disallowance in the manner of regulations to legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax commissioner, effectively, is legislating with no mandate from the people. A good example of this is in the matter of J. K. Williams in my electorate. He is an ordinary taxpayer, a small businessman with no law degree or advice on tax. And I think the size of this bill has to be mentioned. It is about a centimetre thick and has been added to the already cumbersome, complex and heavy Income Tax Assessment Act. J. K. Williams is no lawyer. He is no tax expert and I doubt whether many tax experts would be proficient in every aspect of that entire piece of legislation. On the advice of his bankers and his accountants and in regard to what everyone else in the business was doing at time, he bought a grader using an investment allowance, as prescribed in the tax act. He entered the contract before the cut&hyphen;off date. The gear was delivered before the cut&hyphen;off date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that intervening time, because he did not actually draw down the finance and at the time of drawing down the finance, because he changed the manner in which he held that finance, he was held to have entered into a new contract and to be unable to take advantage of the investment allowance precisely geared to do exactly what he was doing&mdash;reinvesting in his business, creating jobs and expanding. It is hoped that the tax commissioner will not give similar sorts of rulings on this piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can the tax commissioner make such disadvantageous rulings to a small businessman when he is taking advantage of an incentive of a legally prescribed tax break? Certainly the idea of this legislation is to pick up those who are abusing the system. It is not to put the feet of small business into concrete shoes and push them off the pier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that I may be audited after my comments on the tax commissioner, but that is something that small business faces all the time. I want to clearly put on the record for future tax commissioners administering the provisions of the tax act introduced by this bill that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9610"> intention behind this bill, from party room to drafting, is that it will not be unduly cumbersome. This is also relevant to compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not seek burdensome record procedures. In fact, in relation to family trust tax, once the election is made, it is hoped that tax will never be paid, because it is a genuine family trust. They have been in existence for quite some time and have worked quite successfully. It is only when those few seek to take advantage of that tax set up that we run into problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at this issue about non&hyphen;family members injecting income. They can put 100 per cent in and get 40 per cent out. That sounds like some kind of tax break to me. I do not quite grasp the point made by the member for Wills. Normally, those sorts of injections of income come when the trust is running at a loss. Given that it will be taxed if it is distributed to non&hyphen;family members, I do not see the relevance of that particular amendment. I also encourage the tax commissioner to interpret family members in a broadly defined way, similar to the way in which distributions will be broadly defined. Again, I think people like stepchildren need to come within that sort of definition but, again, it is up to the tax commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the Medicare levy, it is only reasonable that once income is drawn from a trust for personal use, tax is paid on it. And if the relevant Medicare levy is required, then that is imposed, too. Quite recently we introduced a superannuation bill where that superannuation surcharge will be applicable to us as parliamentarians. We seek to be even&hyphen;handed and right across Australia with this stuff. If you are eligible for that extra Medicare levy because of your income capacity, then it is only fair that you should pay it if you are gaining your income by way of a trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How are we going to afford the health standards in Australia with an ageing population and, therefore, more users for the government to support, and with a failing private health system and again, therefore, more users for the government to support? I have many friends in the medical area and I talk both to workers in the Nepean and Westmead hospitals. We need tax reform to support a health system left on a precipice by Labor. Waiting lists have blown out according to today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>, which describes a `tenfold rise in elective surgery lists' in New South Wales. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> states:`the queue for surgery keeps growing'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something must be done about this. Positive tax reform that takes into account the needs of small business and the requirement for business in Australia to be able to make a profit to reinvest in this country and have some incentive to do business here and create permanent jobs is what it is all about. I have no hesitation in saying that we have made the right amendments to this bill. As distinct from Labor's proposition, this makes it a workable document for small business in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the second reading amendment read by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). Of course, that second reading amendment refers to the House expressing serious concern about the government's action in delaying the introduction of this important legislation, and it also expresses concern about the changes that have been made to the Labor legislation of 1995 in regard to family trusts. I will come to both of those issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One must ask at the start: just where has this legislation been? This was announced by me as the Treasurer in April 1995. It was introduced into the parliament in September 1995. It was then sidelined by the Senate, so it was part of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9611"> 4) 1995. The rest of it got through, but this part was sidelined into a committee and effectively eliminated from being put on the statute books because with the calling of the election in February 1996, the legislation lapsed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government announced in the budget in August 1996 that it would proceed with modified measures. In February 1997 they gave us an exposure draft of the modified measures and then in May 1997 in the budget, they announced further modified measures. Now, in October 1997, the legislation is finally introduced into the parliament. We are talking of a mammoth delay here. This government can hardly be accused of rushing legislation. Indeed, it has taken 19 months to produce amended legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even allowing for the need for them to reconsider the bills, for public discussions of their proposals, this is surely an inordinate time. And that is important, because what we are talking about here is not minor dollars. We are talking about $550 million of tax which is currently being avoided. It is a large amount of money. Yet this government has been dragging its feet in bringing this legislation to this House. One asks the question why. I think the deputy leader of the opposition, in his second reading speech, gave a pretty good answer as to why there has been this delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just go back for a moment to refer to the need to act against trust losses. I remind the committee that, prior to these measures, losses incurred by trusts could generally be carried forward to offset income in later years and that there was no restriction on the period of the carry forward. This placed trusts in an advantageous position in comparison with companies. For companies to carry forward losses, they had to satisfy a continuity of ownership test or a continuity of business test. Trusts are not required to satisfy any such tests, so a trust could have changed in its composition or dealt with different matters or different business but still be able to carry forward the losses. So trusts are wide open for trafficking in losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where you have a trust with prior losses but little income&mdash;that is, the trust is not able to access the full value of the allowable deductions from the losses&mdash;and there is another trust with sufficient income to be able to offset the prior losses of the deficient income trust if it acquires those losses and so use them fully for tax deductions, it is then in the interests of both of the trusts for them to do a deal, to come to an arrangement, so that they can have the full utilisation of the losses with advantage to both parties&mdash;but a disadvantage, of course, to the national revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The revenue estimates for this measure&mdash;over half a billion dollars, as I have said&mdash;show the extent to which this tax loophole is being used. This is a substantial tax loophole that must be shut. The 1995 measures sought to block this tax loss by placing trusts in much the same position as companies in regard to prior year losses, except that the continuity of business test would only apply to corporate unit trusts and public trading trusts; an income injection test would prevent a deduction for prior losses where income or other consideration was injected into the trust by outsiders to take advantage of the loss; and there were to be special rules for family trusts and discretionary trusts so that family trusts would be able to deduct losses, provided that members of the same family were the only persons who could benefit from the trust and it passed an income injection test. That was an important element in the 1995 measures that we proposed&mdash;the family trust had to pass an income injection test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is now history, these measures did not get through the Senate, so we are now faced with this new legislation after these modifications. The main difference, as I have said, is in relation to family trusts&mdash;that is, the income injection test will not apply to family trusts where the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9612"> income or consideration is injected into the family trust by entities or individuals within the family group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though the original definition of the family group has been narrowed in this legislation, there is still a very big potential loophole that is being left in the tax net in the area of family trusts. So, as against the definition of family that was in the 1995 legislation, we now have a narrow definition but, because of the elimination of the income injection test requirement, there is, in our view, considerably enhanced scope for tax avoidance in family trusts compared with the 1995 legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In narrowing the family group, this legislation eliminates former spouses, great&hyphen;grandparents and aunts and uncles from the family group, but it still leaves parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces and children. There is plenty of scope there to take advantage of the non&hyphen;application of the income injection test, particularly so in the case of very wealthy families with multiple financial interests, all of the family presumably having substantial interests and, in many cases, numerous interests and certainly being capable of injecting income into a trust that has substantial losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern about this goes back to the advice that I received from the tax office and the Treasury about family trusts in late 1995 and early 1996. This advice to me, as Treasurer, from the tax office and the Treasury, pointed out, in the context of drawing attention to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue by high wealth individuals through the use of trusts and other devices, that family trusts are used by high wealth individuals as part of their tax minimisation arrangements and that any reforms should not exclude all family trusts from their ambit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the trust loss measures in particular, the tax office and Treasury twice expressed their concern to me about the rejection of the 1995 legislation in the Senate, saying that the trust loss measures were an essential part of dealing with the taxation of trusts of high wealth individuals and that the efficiency of the trust loss measures in the 1995 legislation was complicated by the fact that they contained concessional treatment for family trusts already in the 1995 legislation. They said that most of the mischief involving high wealth individuals is found in discretionary family trusts. I re&hyphen;emphasise that point: the tax office and Treasury were saying to me that most of the mischief involving high wealth individuals is found in discretionary trusts. The tax office and Treasury were therefore concerned that the government was being told that the category of family trust was defined too narrowly and therefore the implication&mdash;from others, not from the tax office and Treasury&mdash;was that we should be expanding the definition. They were expressing their concern about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax office and Treasury later advised me that the family trust concession introduced into the 1995 legislation was a very significant concession, since it effectively meant that there could be tax loss transfer and income streaming within a family by use of a family trust. In other words, they were saying that by allowing the family to deduct losses within the family trust, you are enabling them to transfer losses around within that group and stream the income according to who can pay the least tax et cetera. That is a very substantial concession and most of the trusts used by high wealth individuals could be loosely described as family trusts. A family trust concession in any broader legislative change could seriously undermine the effectiveness of these changes. And I re&hyphen;emphasise that. The tax office and Treasury were saying to me that a family trust concession in any broader legislative changes than those we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9613"> had already had in the 1995 legislation could seriously undermine the effectiveness of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those were very strong words that were being put to me by my advisers then, the tax office and Treasury, about the dangers of further weakening this legislation. Clearly, the tax office and the Treasury were concerned that expanding the scope for family trusts to be able to utilise prior losses would allow the continuance of a substantial level of tax avoidance through this avenue. That, of course, is exactly what this legislation now before us does. It does exactly what the Treasury and tax office were saying to me should not be done. Despite narrowing the definition of the family, as I have mentioned, by simultaneously removing the income injection test for members of the family, this legislation allows a wide&hyphen;open avenue for tax avoidance, especially for very wealthy people who are capable of injecting other income into a family trust to take advantage of any losses in that trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given their advice to me, I would be very surprised&mdash;indeed I would be astounded&mdash;if this modification of the 1995 legislation has the support of the tax office or the Treasury. Indeed, I would say that this is a reason why it has taken so long to come to us&mdash;because of a struggle about this legislation coming forward in this form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I must say I am not surprised by the approach taken by the government. The coalition parties' actions in opposing the 1995 legislation in the Senate showed where they were coming from. Certainly, the leisurely pace of activity to address this problem since they gained office does not denote a driving zeal to block tax avoidance in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the committee of what I announced in February of 1996, when we released the information that had been given to us recently by the tax office and Treasury about tax avoidance by high wealth individuals, and particularly through the use of trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just paraphrase parts of this press release. In it I said that I had been advised by the tax office and Treasury that in 1993, 80 individuals each with a net worth of over $30 million had returned taxable incomes of $20,000 or less&mdash;not paid tax of $20,000 but had taxable incomes of $20,000 or less. That enabled them to qualify for low income rebates, Medicare exemptions, deferral of HECS payments, reduced child support payments, et cetera. By 19 January 1996, the Treasury and the tax office were able to advise me that on the basis of work undertaken on 100 wealthy individuals, they expected that action to block these tax minimisation techniques would raise at least $500 million, and they later raised that to $800 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the press release I also said that the tax office identified a number of complex tax planning arrangements used by some wealthy individuals to avoid tax and these included: the characterisation of income as capital by the use of multiple trust structures to conceal a common controlling mind, and the tax office had found a number of cases of wealthy individuals operating over 100 trusts; the creation of artificial losses, revenue as well as capital, to neutralise otherwise taxable profits; distributions to wealthy individuals and family members being disguised as loans and other benefits which are claimed to be non&hyphen;taxable; the continued use of offshore trusts to hold significant funds which seemed to be applied for the benefit of wealthy individuals and their families; and the use of Australian charitable trusts and overseas organisations to disguise benefits provided by family trading trusts to family members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went on in that press release to state that on 29 January 1996 I wrote to the Secretary to the Treasury and to the Commissioner for Taxation asking them as a matter of urgency to develop a legislative response to cover income for the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year. I asked as a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9614"> matter of urgency, and I asked for that in January 1996. Here we are in October 1997 and we have not had any response. We have not had any response, effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The then opposition leader and now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) reacted to that press release of mine by saying that he was sceptical of the monetary estimates, although they were provided by the tax office and by Treasury, they were not my estimates. He also described the amounts estimated to be avoided as fairyland. This did not seem like the response of a man who was determined to stamp out tax avoidance, and his government's inaction in office in relation to this area would only confirm that initial impression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some action taken in areas such as charitable trusts, in thin capitalisation which relates to companies and trusts and the watered down approach to trust losses now before us, all areas identified by Labor as needing to be addressed, but what of all the other areas I have pointed to on advice from the tax office and Treasury being utilised by high wealth individuals? Nothing concrete has happened at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, earlier this year there were reports of further investigation by the tax office into another 100 wealthy individuals and there were various press reports about this. One was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 24 February 1997 headed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Office's new rich hit list</EMPHASIS> and quoted the tax commissioner as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The integrity of the tax system relies on us dealing with this.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He must be getting pretty desperate indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, in the budget the government announced it would release a discussion paper prepared by the tax office and Treasury outlining relevant tax issues and broad policy issues for the appropriate taxation of trusts. Although this was announced in May, we still have not seen this discussion paper. The government claimed it would be in a position to consider this matter in a legislative way in the context of the 1998&hyphen;99 budget, but with no paper yet and time needed for public consideration and submission to government, and time for the government to decide what to do, if anything, it is starting to look doubtful that we will see any action in next year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, this is not a government which is highly motivated to take effective action against substantial tax avoidance. My advice was that it would take about six months to prepare legislation, but here we are almost 20 months after the change of government and we have not got a discussion paper let alone some legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that is not stopping the tax commissioner from raising some issues of his own. In a speech to CEDA in Adelaide on 10 September 1997, the tax commissioner made some very worthwhile points indeed. He said in the course of this speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both companies and trust structures can offer the advantages of limited liability and a capacity to split income (even more in the case of trusts). In these circumstances we think it is perfectly valid to raise for consideration the question "why should not the starting point for this be that companies and trusts be treated the same as tax purposes". Thus, for example, we believe it is fair to ask why certain distributions from a business conducted through a trust are capable of being received free of tax while the same distribution made from a business conducted through a company is subject to tax.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a very good question indeed, and I am pleased to see him raising the issue publicly. He went on in that address to refer to the high wealth individuals and tax avoidance and noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In excess of 2500 entities have been found to be associated with around 100 wealthy individuals examined in some detail. These entities include around 550 discretionary trusts, 230 unit trusts and 20 charitable trusts. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9615">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is for 100 people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have not fully analysed the use of these entities or whether they are necessarily tax motivated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However our examination does reveal that during the l995 income year alone the total amount of tax free distributions from reserves to beneficiaries of the trusts was around $50m. In one case, an amount of $19m was distributed to a wealthy individual. In another case, a wealthy individual received distributions of $5m per annum over at least three years from trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arguably these results may be within the law. But to the extent they are it demonstrates in quite graphic terms the impact of the distinction in treatment for tax purposes of business activities conducted through trusts as opposed to companies in general and a differing treatment of distributions in particular.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is clear that in that address the tax commissioner was putting forward a view that there is a substantial case for taxing trusts like companies. However, once he had made that point, two weeks later the Prime Minister was reported as telling his government party room, when he was asked in the party room about this issue of the taxation of trusts, that the party would not be doing anything that would bankrupt small business. Again, he seemed to put a damper on it, and the press reports were along the lines of him having slapped the tax commissioner down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would appear that this government is at odds with its advisers on anti&hyphen;tax avoidance measures and, therefore, unable to take effective action in this area. Nevertheless, we look forward to the discussion paper, and some eventual legislation in an area that is crying out for amendment to protect the revenue from rampant avoidance practices and to remove the absolute obscenity of extremely wealthy people being able to arrange their affairs within the law so that they pay little or no tax.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always useful to follow the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who has considerable experience in this area. I do not intend for one moment to hold myself out as an expert either in tax law or in legislation relating to avoidance. I remember doing tax in l980 when I was at law school but that is about the only thing I do remember about it, thankfully. Having said that, my very quick understanding of this legislation is that I do not have terribly much understanding of it because it is extraordinarily complex legislation. There are 140 pages involved and 186 pages of explanatory memoranda. I have one principal objection to it, which concerns me greatly, and that is the element of retrospectivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, a press release was issued by the honourable member on 9 May l995, and 2&half; years later we are considering legislation that will have an effect on people who have lodged tax returns in those years past. I say right at the outset that I am fundamentally opposed to the notion of retrospectivity and I think that in this particular case I am going to have great difficulty supporting this legislation for that very reason. I am particularly attracted to some of the flaws that have been raised in relation to this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say right at the outset that I do not have a family trust myself, and I do not support people who avoid tax&mdash;and I do not think it would be terribly easy for anybody to do otherwise. I have no truck whatsoever with anybody who is avoiding tax on the grand scale outlined by the honourable member for Gellibrand. Obviously, all of the professional bodies, such as the NTAA, have accepted the need to prevent trafficking in tax losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the problem is that the legislation goes much further than that. It goes beyond that. That is a real problem I have in terms of retrospectivity, because you cannot have legislation by press release. You cannot purely point to a press release and say, `It is not really retrospectivi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9616"> ty. See that press release? We said'&mdash;as did the previous government&mdash;`that we were going to prevent the trafficking in trust losses.' It really is an unacceptable proposition to do so, because it creates the potential for precedents across a number of other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned to say this carefully: if you open the door in any area of legislation to this principle being diluted, it can be diluted across the board, and that is of great concern, particularly if there is any reliance on a press release to say that in reality people were put on notice. They were not put on notice to 140 pages of legislation and 186 pages of explanatory memoranda as at 9 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concerns I have are for my small business constituents in particular, people who may be unwittingly caught up in this legislation. While in one sense I have no difficulty at all in agreeing with the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) that we do need tax reform, it does concern me when the member refers to the largesse, if you like, of the tax commissioner in interpreting what `family' means. The fact of the matter is that this legislation will not apply to great&hyphen;grandchildren. You cannot say, `Let's have an expansive definition here of "family"'. It will simply not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to give some examples in which it will apply and which, in my view, illustrate how small business can be affected and caught up by this. Look at these two examples. Firstly, A and B each own 50 per cent of the units in a unit trust which operates a nursery business. The business is not going very well and is making losses. Person A decides to get out and consequently sells his units in the unit trust to B. Person B is able to turn the business around and get the unit trust to trade out of financial difficulty. Under the proposed new laws, the unit trust will not be able to claim a deduction for its prior losses even though it and B have suffered the economic effect of the losses. If A and B had been trading through a company instead, the company would have been able to claim a deduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, Mr and Mrs Jones operate a small business through their family company. The Jones family trust distributes income to the company to help cover its operating expenses. In order to receive the distribution of income, the company has had to make an `interposed entity election' under the new proposed laws. Five years later, the Jones family company wishes to expand its business by exporting its products to America. As part of this expansion, 20 new jobs will be created. To finance its expansion, it looks for an equity investor. Under the proposed new trust loss laws the company is unable to expand. If it does take on a new equity investor, any dividends or return of capital paid to that investor will be taxed at the top marginal rate plus Medicare levy. As a result, the company will not expand, and an export opportunity and 20 jobs are lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bear in mind that the press release of 9 May 1995, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trafficking in trust losses</EMPHASIS>, said, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax law contains tests which limit the deductibility of losses incurred by companies. Their main purpose is to prevent a company with undeducted prior year losses being sold by its shareholders to a purchaser needing a vehicle in which tax shielded income could be accumulated . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions do not apply to the deductibility of trust losses.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It has been said by the NTAA that the proposed provisions, as I said before, go way beyond the stated intention. I have mentioned retrospectivity. The complexity is really quite an exercise in contrasts. The ATO, on the one hand, promotes simplified tax laws and, on the other hand, introduces legislation like this.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9617">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I state the issue in an example that is fairly contemporary. A trust can last a good number of years&mdash;say 80 years. If it is a family trust, under this legislation it can only be distributed to the defendant's family within the categories. It stops at grandchildren. If there is now a one&hyphen;year&hyphen;old child of that family, 60 years from now he or she will be 61. He or she cannot distribute to his or her children in relation to that trust. Therefore, in my view the definition of family needs to be expanded to extend to great&hyphen;grandchildren and great&hyphen;great&hyphen;grandchildren. It is something that I respectfully ask the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to consider. At the stage we are talking about, where you have the 61&hyphen;year&hyphen;old, it is almost inevitable that the children will be running the business. But if income is distributed to them, they will be paying tax at the top rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why then can there not be a more simplified situation in relation to tests? The High Court in the Spotless case has held that part 4A has significant teeth to deal with any tax avoidance arrangements that may be able to technically satisfy the continuity of ownership test or same business test, where there has been a trafficking in trust losses, just as it can apply to schemes entered into to get around the company loss rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is wrong with these simple rules with these tests, the same as with company loss provisions? The continuity of ownership test is continuity of control test for non&hyphen;fixed trusts and a same business test. There need be no other test because of the law in relation to part 4A and the case to which I have referred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been told by an accountant in my electorate today that the complexity of these new laws will mean that ordinary small business people who have come to him will need to go out and get advice from a fairly expensive lawyer, as well as increased costs in the accountancy business itself.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SK6">Mr TONY SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Chifley is reminding me about lawyers' fees, which it would be nice to be reminded about sometimes. It reminds me of a comment made, when there was a very long defamation case running in England and one of the lawyers broke his leg during this case, that there was no truth in the rumour that he did that running to the bank to deposit the fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is the case, I am told by an accountant in my electorate, that this will mean more complexity and more costs for small business people. I have no problem about dealing with the rorters&mdash;and nobody does. Nobody from the NTAA and nobody from the accountancy profession locally in my electorate has a problem with the need to chop out the trafficking in trust losses. But when we go too far&mdash;if this legislation has in fact gone too far, as I am advised that it has&mdash;in my view, we are hurting the people that we need not to hurt. We are trying to promote small business and we are trying to promote employment, particularly in the examples that I have given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask the Treasurer to look carefully again&mdash;the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) is the minister responsible for this of course&mdash;at this piece of legislation, particularly the retrospectivity aspect which, as I said at the outset, I have great difficulty in going along with and, indeed, as presently advised, I do not feel disposed to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also ask him to look at a more simplified way of looking at these particular measures. Business has been used to company rules for many years. They have worked well&mdash;the tougher part 4A provisions and so forth. After looking at those matters that I earnestly put before him, I would ask that some allowance be given to looking at a different way of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9618"> approaching this, with a view to at least ameliorating the fact that businesses that have lodged returns already will have to have reassessments in relation to their income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the tax commissioner ultimately, because I do not think my submissions are going to change the course of this legislation, could give some relief and exercise some discretion in particular circumstances, having regard to the announcement that was made on 9 May and the legislation that was ultimately produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do ask that these matters be looked at more carefully in the future. It seems to me that, in principle, to be announcing something in May of 1995, to have an election interposed, and then to be considering the legislation in October of 1997, really does give rise to an argument, on the part of those in the community who are affected by this legislation, that it is simply not fair.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been suggested, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Bill 1997, in a slightly altered form, was originally proposed under the previous Labor government, and I support the measures. In fact, like most opposition speakers, we would seek to have it go a lot further. But I really wanted to initially comment on a couple of statements made by the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I found the contribution of the honourable member for Lindsay to be extraordinary. She said that really we should not be taxing the rich, that it was a disgraceful thing that people on social security could be getting more than people who were in the workplace&mdash;and I would be happy to concede that as a problem. But if you have a bill that is essentially looking at tax avoidance, that is, people minimising the amount of tax they pay, I just do not understand the causal link to those on social security. That is a most absurd proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She then went on to talk about the situation in Ireland, not about trusts. She said that the Irish government was encouraging some industries. I support that. I think it is a terrific idea. Again, it has nothing to do with fairness and equity in the tax system. Indeed, government speakers have said, `Well, the Labor Party isn't interested in tax reform.' Of course we are. We always have been. Our particular interests are that we believe that everyone should pay their fair share of taxation. It should not just be the PAYE taxpayers&mdash;that is, the ordinary working men and women of Australia&mdash;who should be shouldering the full burden of income tax. We believe everyone should and, in particular, the wealthiest Australians. Why should they dodge their responsibility to pay a fair share of tax? Of course, family trusts allow them to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apparently, family trusts are going to be excluded from the purview of this legislation. Indeed, the taxation commissioner is very keen to examine the whole issue of how the wealthiest 100 Australians avoid $800 million worth of taxation by using trusts. Why should some of the wealthiest individuals in Australia receive $1 million, $2 million or $3 million tax free&mdash;not for one year, but for several years? How is that fair and equitable? Is anyone going to suggest that workers in your electorate are going to be able to set up a trust to receive their PAYE income and then minimise their PAYE taxation? Of course not and nor can they do it in Lindsay, as the honourable member for Lindsay well and truly knows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She made a very interesting observation about GST. I presume the honourable member for Lindsay is in favour of GST. She is saying, `Well, services are now going to be able to be delivered on the Internet.' Yes, they are. I make it very clear not only to the people in my own electorate of Chifley but also to people in the neighbouring electorate of Lindsay that I do not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9619"> support a GST. I do not think it is the highest priority issue in taxation facing this country. I really do believe that the highest priority is returning equity and fairness into taxation and in making the wealthiest Australians shoulder their fair share of the burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contribution of the honourable member for O'Connor was most extraordinary. I am not sure how he was able to get nursing homes into a debate about trusts but he did so very successfully. He made a very offensive comment. He said, `Oh look, when the Labor Party raises the issue of an accommodation bond of some $250,000, they never talk about nursing homes in the western suburbs of Sydney.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will talk about nursing homes in the western suburbs of Sydney. It is true that we have Doug Moran nursing homes in the western suburbs of Sydney. For the record, I have had a director of nursing come to me and complain bitterly about one of my federal colleagues. He said, `Can you get her off my back.' He asked me whether I knew her. He asked, `Why was she making these complaints? Doesn't she know that I am a new director of nursing?' One complaint in this Doug Moran nursing home was that patients were being sedated early in the afternoon not because they were stressed or had some psychological or psychiatric problem but to minimise the care. Another complaint was that they were being physically restrained in the afternoon, again to minimise the level of care that was being made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third complaint was that they were being fed in the very early afternoon&mdash;to avoid overtime or shift penalty payments, obviously. That is absolutely terrible. I say to Mr Moran and his family company of nursing homes: shame on you. This is no way to treat the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, yes, we do have a Doug Moran nursing home in the western suburbs of Sydney and I am not aware of one Labor colleague accepting a political donation from Doug Moran. Nor do I know of one former Labor member or senator being employed by Doug Moran. So our hands are not dirty in terms of this nursing home policy. But let me tell you about a couple of the impacts of this accommodation bond in the western suburbs of Sydney. Firstly, we have cut out the capital grants to new nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member for parliament representing my area, I am very pleased that I have been able to participate in the opening of nursing homes to serve the frail aged in my community. We have a wonderful order of Filipino nuns there. I have the largest number of Australian Filipinos in any LGA in my electorate&mdash;Blacktown is the capital&mdash;and I believe that when the new census figures come out, it will show an even higher number, twice that of the next government area, Fairfield.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Filipinos want to set up a nursing home for the frail aged in the Filipino community. It is true that there are not the demographics to justify an exclusive Filipino nursing home, and they do not want to do that. They think that they are able to offer special things in care and pastoral care to anyone who comes to their nursing home. Under the Labor government, if they got approval for a nursing home&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say that those people, the Augustinian sisters, will not get a capital grant, so the impact in the western suburbs of Sydney is this: yes, we have a lot of religious and community nursing homes, but as time goes on because there is no capital assistance, you will not see new nursing homes development in the community and religious sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for O'Connor said that it is okay, that it is only $250,000, only a quarter of the value of the house. Yes, I am concerned about those who have to sell their houses, but the people that I am most concerned about are those that do not have a house. They do not have assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are going to see a number of things happen. Firstly, you are going to see people dying at home lacking care because they cannot get into a nursing home.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue about trusts and about avoidance. As I said before, the Labor Party is always interested in tax reform. We do not believe, for example, that imposition of a goods and services tax is the highest priority because, frankly, a goods and services tax is going to benefit my good friend the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and myself, and other members of parliament. We will be the ones to get the benefit out of a GST because we have discretionary income. But out in my electorate, with ordinary families and ordinary people, you find that they spend up to the limit of their income every week or every fortnight.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9621"> them. They are very proud of it, and if they are able to pay off a home in the process, again, that is a source of great pride. But they do not have any discretionary income to put into savings or to make choices about their expenditure, so they are the ones that are going to feel the real impact of a GST.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the member for Lindsay, I would like to make it very clear that I am opposed to a GST. I am also absolutely opposed to people who can use trusts to minimise their fair share of income tax. Part of this legislation prevents trusts acquiring the losses of someone else and incorporating those losses into the trust. But the real issue that I think the parliament should be considering is: where is the discussion paper that the Commissioner for Taxation has promised us on this whole issue of trusts and income minimisation? Is the government exerting undue pressure? Are they discouraging the Commissioner for Taxation from producing it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had an example already in the House where the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) does not apologise for wanting to prevent a statutory authority, the Law Reform Commission, from making a submission to a parliamentary tribunal. Do you know the reason? He does not like what the Law Reform Commission is going to say about it. Although in the House  today Mr Speaker, in his wisdom, did not give precedence to a breach of privilege, of course the Senate has seen it completely differently and with less material to make that decision. So we do have precedents with this government where, if they do not like the message from the messenger, what do they do? They try to stop it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I say to the Commissioner for Taxation, whom I know very well and whom I have a great regard for as a dedicated and keen officer: resist any pressure that may be exerted. We need to clean up the tax act. We need to clean up what is currently legal avoidable income tax. We have to start returning a degree of fairness in there&mdash;and not fairness for the wealthy, not fairness for the middle class, but for the ordinary folk who never have any opportunities to minimise the amount of income tax they pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there is the issue of child support. The Australian Taxpayers Association maintains that the bill will adversely affect some people involved in the payment of child support. How regrettable this is. When this government, to its credit, announced some changes and reforms to the Child Support Act, what did they do? They wimped it; they absolutely wimped it. In what was a bipartisan committee report with the now Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) on it, with a now parliamentary secretary on it, with the present president of the Senate, Senator Reid, on it, with a present chairman of a parliamentary committee on it&mdash;all from the then opposition side&mdash;what do we see the government do?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that neither my learned friend or yourself are disputing the press release and its impact on child support. But let me say one of the recommendations in the committee report concerns trusts. In fact there was a whole chapter devoted to repairing the income base. Just as this bill that we are considering is about repairing the income tax base, so it was with the child support report. We proposed that the Commissioner of Taxation, or should I say the Child Support Registrar, wearing his other hat, had the discretion to add in income for child support purposes from the trust.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I need to make the point that the government ignored those recommendations bar one. Why did you not pick up the trust recommendations? Did you not like the trust recommendations? Why should not income that people derive tax&hyphen;free from a trust be counted towards child support? I agree with the Australian Taxpayers Association. Child support is involved with those who minimise their incomes via trusts. In fact, the group of women who are worse off under the scheme have been those women who married men or partners capable of legally minimising their taxation. They have generally received not one cent and of course the government completely turned its back on them. I do not know whether it is part of its small business policy that especially favours people who are allowed to minimise or big business for that matter as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I will finish on this non&hyphen;controversial note. Let us all be fair.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem could easily have been fixed by incorporating the company loss rules into the general loss carry forward provisions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Instead, we are presented with approximately 150 pages of mind bending legislation and explanatory memorandum that would give the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Odyssey</EMPHASIS>  a run for its money for length and complexity. And all the while the tax law improvement project team continues to toil away at simplifying the existing tax act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax commissioner and the Treasurer assert that the intention of this legislation is to close loopholes which allow individuals `at the big end of town' to avoid paying their fair share 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9623"> of tax. The reality is that this legislation will affect businesses that make a loss, principally small businesses and those from the farming sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point was reinforced in the 22 September edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> which said amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Michael Carmody is a loose canon operating outside the tax reform debate, flogging the old idea that there is money to be harvested from the rich . . . In the process he is driving a knife into the heart of small business. . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Official figures reveal that approximately 367,000 trusts were in operation in l994&hyphen;95. In the same year an Australian Taxation Office examination showed that the top 100 wealthy Australians were linked to 2,500 trusts. It is absurd for the government to attempt to justify its decision to tax trust losses on the grounds that it is targeting the high-fliers when they account for less than 1 per cent of all trusts in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr John Hallows, a contributor to the business pages in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS>, made another telling point about the use of trusts in Australia. On 14 September 1997 he noted that for as long as the direct tax base in Australia continues to shrink, and in the absence of a total overhaul of our tax system, the taxation office will continue to look towards tax minimisation and tax avoidance schemes to shore up the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It stands to reason that until such time as there is parity between the top rate of personal income tax and the company tax rate, Australians will continue to turn to trusts and other devices to maximise their after-tax earnings. This argument was also presented in the 31 May 1997 edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine. In an article entitled `The Disappearing Taxpayer' it was noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadening the tax base . . . would allow a much lower rate of tax and therefore reduce the incentive for tax evasion . . . Less complex reporting requirements would reduce another incentive to hide from the taxman.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government has got a lot of ground to cover on both counts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past few months, Mr Carmody has provided information to the national media of one or two extreme cases that were intended to bear out his concern that government revenue is being threatened by the use of trusts. Newspapers, including the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, reported Mr Carmody's examples of one individual who received a tax-free amount of $19 million in one year and another who got $5 million over three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Exactly how the ATO came to this figure is not known but it is interesting to reflect on these calculations in the light of information provided by the Department of the Treasury to the Senate estimates committee on 8 May 1997. Dr Ken Henry was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you have any estimates of the revenue lost due to this transfer of trust losses within a group of related trusts?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He answered with an unembellished `No.' I am not sure what part of the word `no' the ATO does not understand. The ATO has continued to suggest, and peddle the line, that changes in the tax treatment of trusts will net the federal government something in the vicinity of, or up to, I am not quite sure, $800 million annually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apparently the Taxation Office calculates its sums differently from Treasury because the government's 1997&hyphen;98 budget papers estimate a $100 million saving to revenue from its proposed measures. One hundred million dollars is a substantial saving in anyone's book but it is remarkably humble in comparison to that predicted by the Australian Taxation Office. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9624"> Perhaps it is one of the rare occasions when our Treasurer (Mr Costello) opted to take a dose of modesty pills. Or perhaps, as Mr Kirkwood indicates, it is yet another example of `the bureaucracy looking into a dark corner, not being sure of what it sees, and deciding that a healthy dose of Agent Orange would be simpler than more light on the subject.' If that criticism sounds similar to earlier reproaches about the government's treatment of R&amp;D syndication, it is because it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition made it very clear last year that its principal motivation in axing the R&amp;D syndication concession was to stamp out what it perceived to be a rorting of the scheme. It became obsessed with the notion of abuse and yet, to this day, the government has failed to substantiate its claim. Just as the government has shamelessly harped on the notion of tax avoidance by big business, to gain support from the average Australian taxpayer in its decision to axe R&amp;D syndication, it is now seeking asylum for its attack on trusts, on the grounds that high income earners are the target of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the motivation behind this legislation is further thrown into doubt by the fact that none of it is necessary for the government to collect its projected $100 billion. At the Senate estimates committee, on 5 June of this year, Dr Henry said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The $100 million does not depend upon there being any change at all to the taxation treatment of trusts. As I understand it, that $100 million relates predominantly to enhanced compliance activity on the part of the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If Treasury admits that the ATO has received an additional $19 million in resources to retrieve the sum of $100 million and `investigate the affairs of high wealth individuals', then why has this legislation been introduced at all? It is time that the government came clean on its approach to trust losses. As I have indicated, many tax professionals believe that there is room to improve the integrity of the trust structure. Specifically, deficiencies relating to overseas payments from trusts, and some income splitting arrangements, have been singled out as requiring reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as recently as 8 May 1997, Mr Simpson, who is also from the Department of the Treasury, made it clear to the Senate estimates committee that the Taxation Office had not conducted any detailed analysis into the constituent parts of family trusts. Nor had it undertaken research to determine the ratio of Australian citizens and residents involved in domestic trust arrangements, as opposed to the number of foreign residents and citizens who benefit from Australian trusts. In other words, the very parts of our current trust legislation that are most open to exploitation have not been the subject of a thorough Treasury investigation. No wonder it has been suggested that the government is wandering blind on the issue. The fact is that the impact of this legislation will extend way beyond Australia's high income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is there a massive discrepancy between the figures being tossed around by the Australian Taxation Office and the government, but the coalition also seems to be unable to provide consistency in its own calculations. On budget night 1997, the Treasurer indicated that it would be almost impossible to forecast the savings to revenue beyond the 1997&hyphen;98 year. This was in May. However, the explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill states that the government expects to benefit from the taxing of trusts to the tune of $200 million in the three years ending with 2001. That is a pretty quick transition: somewhere in the four months between budget night and the introduction of this legislation, Treasury has manufactured an additional $200 million in the equation. Where is the accuracy in the guesstimates? The answer is, of course, that there is none.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9625">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trusts are utilised widely throughout the small business sector as a legitimate business structure. While Mr Alan Swan, the education director at the Australian Taxpayers Association, commended the government on some parts of this legislation&mdash;as do I&mdash;he went on to observe in his press statement of 8 October:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that family trusts are one of the most common structures used by . . . small businesses, many . . . will continue to be unfairly treated by the new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Swan went further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has received numerous submissions from taxpayers and small businesses since 1995, but has chosen to retain (and even add to) some of the illogical and ill&hyphen;considered provisions in its latest bid to have the legislation passed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Swan criticised the government for failing to consult adequately with advisers to the small business sector. Like Ernst and Young, the ATA is concerned that elements in this legislation go way beyond what was originally intended by the government. For example, Mr Swan has criticised those parts of the bill which exclude certain family members from future trust structures. Individuals who are dependants for superannuation purposes and who could have responsibilities under the Child Support (Assessment) Act and may benefit from an inheritance from a deceased estate will not be deemed to be members of a family trust unless and until this legislation is amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Swan asserts that the viability of small businesses may be affected, as they will have to decide between `removing key family members from a share of the present or future beneficial ownership of business' or else accept the `potential loss or postponement of legitimate claims for losses incurred during business downturns'. Is this what the government had in mind when it claimed in the explanatory memorandum that the legislation was intended to `improve the integrity, equity and efficiency of the taxation system'? Is it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trusts are popular amongst family&hyphen;run small businesses, as you very well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, because they avoid many of the related compliance obligations and costs that are part and parcel of a company structure. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>, an effect of this legislation will be that many small businesses will have little alternative but to become partnerships, and will lose their limited liability in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As several independent analysts have recently observed, the wealthy individuals who deliberately employed devious and complex trust arrangements to avoid paying tax will simply put in place alternative but equally devious and complex arrangements to ensure the same end result. The Treasury admitted as much when one of its senior economists told a Senate committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It could be the case that no matter what suite of measures might ever be implemented, some part of that, perhaps a large part of it, might never actually be collected.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In its regulation impact statement, the government has made it clear that family trusts will be excepted from the changes proposed in this legislation. It is a welcome exclusion. However, what is to stop the so&hyphen;called high rollers from transferring benefits into this type of structure, in order to avoid the tax payable on those trusts that will be bound by the legislation? In the meantime, every small business that is forced to alter its structure as a consequence of this legislation will confront an increased compliance regimen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on the 15 September, Mr Ross Greenwood asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the tax officers move truly be a way to reap more tax from the wealthiest . . . or add another impost on the self&hyphen;employed? 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9626">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So much for the coalition's commitment to reducing its impositions on small businesses by 50 per cent in the term of this parliament. The retrospective nature of this legislation will also impact on the compliance costs of small businesses. The collective cost to business to submit amendments to earlier tax returns will be considerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are to be four dates of effect for the measures contained in the bill, all of which will have a retrospective application. Ever since the former Labor government introduced its own trust losses legislation in this place in 1995, tax experts have continued to work under a cloud of uncertainty. How have they been able to correctly advise their clients of the best commercial structure for their business needs? Quite simply they have not been able to and through no fault of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, this legislation will automatically preclude a stepchild from a family trust if his or her parent dies or ceases to live with the test individual of the trust. One of the more alarming things about that provision which has been highlighted by the ATA is that this measure was not announced prior to the 1997 budget. Mr Alan Swan has indicated that this will mean that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That trustees of family trusts who irrevocably elected to become a family trust before the budget, have inadvertently evicted any stepchildren from their family trust&mdash;a harsh penalty for those compliant taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The ATA has called on the coalition to amend its legislation to ensure that individuals are not unfairly excluded from a family trust structure. The Law Council of Australia went further than this in its submission to Treasury, when it suggested, amongst other things, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the council has formed the view that the current regime covering the taxation of trusts remains appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 8 May earlier this year, the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, told the Senate estimates committee that the government does not `claim' to be the champion of small business; they are the champion of small business. Very brave words, Senator Kemp. I wonder how many small business proprietors will agree with him given the government's track record on small business reform to date. It is a disgrace that it has taken in excess of 24 months for the debate on tax treatment of trust losses to reach the parliament. The tax community and the small business sector have operated in an uncertain environment because of the issue of trust losses for far too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by going back to my original position. There is room to improve the efficiency of the trust system. However, the government cannot adequately address this issue without the full knowledge of facts. Even so, if this legislation passes through the parliament intact, it is important to recognise that trusts will remain an effective business structure for many small businesses. However, it is high time that the Treasurer and the Commissioner of Taxation came clean about their approach towards trust losses, that they end uncertainty and that they cease pretending that their sole aim is to target high income earners.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9627">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a few concluding remarks. In particular, I would like to make some comments about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). He made some quite extraordinary remarks during his contribution to the debate. I just want to refer to some of those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point he made was that the government had significantly watered down measures to deal in the trafficking in trust losses and had gone soft on tax avoidance. I think this really is quite a remarkable suggestion. Here we are doing something about it and he is suggesting that we have really gone soft on it all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation before the committee is to restrict the trafficking in trust losses. The coalition committed in opposition to proceed with the measures to address trafficking in trust losses and it has fulfilled that commitment. There can be no suggestion that the government has gone soft in this area. The legislation before the committee demonstrates the government's commitment to pursue legislation in this area. As to the changes announced by the government, those changes have been aimed at ensuring that the legislation is targeted squarely at trafficking arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation introduced by the previous government was universally condemned as going far beyond trafficking in trust losses. It was suggested by many in the tax professions, and elsewhere, that the original trust loss legislation changed dramatically the taxation treatment of trust losses well beyond what was recognised at the time as trafficking arrangements. Indeed, these criticisms were acknowledged by the previous government when it foreshadowed significant amendments to its legislation in the Senate in December 1995, just prior to the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party had itself recognised that its legislation had gone too far and sought to ameliorate its impact. No doubt that is really why the opposition is supporting this legislation here today. They understand that it is good legislation. Even though there has been a lot of blustering about various issues in this debate, essentially the opposition are here and they are supportive of this legislation. The government's legislation is targeted specifically at trafficking arrangements, as the previous government first intended. As for the deputy leader's comments regarding conflict of interest, those allegations really do not deserve a response and I will not be making any here today about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to summarise the merits of the changes by the bills. The purpose of the trust loss measures is to restrict the recoupment of losses and other deductions of trusts in order to prevent the transfer of the tax benefit of the losses. This occurs when a person, who did not bear the economic effect of the loss when it was incurred by the trust, obtains a benefit as a result of the trust's ability to deduct the loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed measures will prevent a significant erosion of the tax base that would otherwise arise from the transfer of the tax benefit of trust losses. There are no provisions in the income tax law similar to those which apply to companies which effectively regulate the deductibility of trust losses against current and future income.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures deal with an anomaly in the current treatment of trusts and will improve the efficiency and the equity of the taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In developing the legislation, the government has undertaken extensive consultation with taxpayers and tax professionals over a lengthy period. I would just like to underline that. There has been a lot of consultation and much of what is in this legislation is a product of that. This 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9628"> legislation therefore does take account of the legitimate concerns of taxpayers while preserving and, in some respects, improving the integrity of the measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the measures will impose some additional compliance costs on taxpayers, this is outweighed by the benefits of improving the integrity, the equity and the efficiency of the taxation system. I would like to thank those people who have contributed to this debate and I commend the bills to the chamber.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R351">Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  is to amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 which is known in the trade as the SI(S) Act. The amendments will permanently reinstate certain arrangements set out in a number of temporary modification declarations made pursuant to section 333 of the SI(S) Act that were in place up until June 1996. Since that time, the discretionary powers granted to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner by the temporary modification declarations have lapsed. This has serious implications for the retirement incomes of members of superannuation funds which are affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The temporary modification declarations gave the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner the discretion to allow an extension of time for certain superannuation funds to meet the administrative requirements to be considered regulated under the SI(S) Act. Regulation under the SI(S) Act can make a superannuation fund eligible for concessional taxation treatment. Obviously, for a superannuation fund to miss out on this concessional taxation treatment because of an administrative error or an inability to meet a deadline due to special circumstances would be both unfair and unnecessarily stringent and would heavily penalise members of that fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Giving the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner the discretion to grant an extension of time is a sensible way of dealing with this issue and, for that reason, Labor is supportive of the measures contained in this bill. It was Labor back in 1993 who established the SI(S) Act for the purpose of ensuring the prudent management and essential protection of the superannuation deposits of all Australians&mdash;a most important matter. To date, with very few exceptions, the SI(S) Act has proven to be an outstanding piece of prudential regulatory legislation which has effectively safeguarded the superannuation assets of many thousands of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The success of the SI(S) Act and, indeed, the establishment of the superannuation guarantee are part of Labor's superannuation record, a record of which we are particularly proud. That is why we treat any amendments to the SI(S) Act with the utmost importance, regardless of how small or inconsequential they may appear to be. If we recall the period prior to Labor's introduction to the superannuation guarantee where only 40 per cent of Australian workers had access to any kind of superannuation, and if we note the extension of superannuation as a result of the superannuation guarantee to 90 per cent of Australian workers, that is a matter that we need to safeguard jealously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent superannuation changes the government has made have caused great concern and a great deal of anguish amongst the public and within the superannuation industry. Labor is listening to the community and understands the frustration that many people feel from the constant changes to superannuation regulation that have occurred since this government came 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9630"> to power. The message that Labor is hearing is that people are sick of having their retirement nest eggs interfered with by a government which moves the superannuation goalposts every time it suits its agenda. As I indicated, Labor is particularly proud of its superannuation record, one of extending access to superannuation from those who were well&hyphen;off, across to the broadband of Australian workers, providing opportunities which simply were not there prior to our changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, on 20 September this year, the government's shortsighted and unfair measure of including superannuation assets in the means test for over&hyphen;55s who are in receipt of an income support payment came into force. I have had constituents coming into my own office expressing great concern about how this impacts on them personally. For example, there was a bank teller with the ANZ Bank who had been subject to three armed robberies in the space of 12 months. Not surprisingly, he is no longer a bank teller, and at the age of 55 he has no realistic prospects of getting back into the work force to do something else. He is now expected to access the superannuation nest egg which he had worked for and which was his legitimate entitlement because he is simply not eligible for the disability pension to which he would otherwise be entitled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will run down his superannuation over the next few years and become dependent on the age pension. I think that is a completely unfair situation. This is a measure which has impacted on some 67,000 Australians who have had their income support payments reduced, or cut off completely, and they have also have lost access to concession or health care cards. These many thousands of Australians have been effectively forced by the government into early retirement just so that they can access their modest superannuation moneys to replace the income that the government has taken from them. That is simply not good enough. It does not take into account the reality that many over&hyphen;55s do not have access to the work force and a realistic prospect of getting access to the work force until their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another way in which this government has shifted the superannuation goalposts is through the introduction of the 15 per cent superannuation tax. This is supposed to impact on high income earners, but it will, in fact, impact on low and middle&hyphen;income earners. Administration of that superannuation cost has been estimated to cost upwards of $100 million. That cost will be paid for not only by the high income earners that the tax is supposedly catching, but also the many thousands of Australians who earn much less than the $70,000 threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what about those fund members who do not provide their tax file number to their superannuation fund? Many of those people are also going to end up paying the superannuation surcharge, or superannuation tax, regardless of their income level. So the message that Labor is hearing from the public and the superannuation industry is that people are, regrettably, losing confidence in the superannuation system. The message from people to this government is: stop moving those superannuation goalposts; don't make retrospective changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be said that this amendment does involve a change that is applying retrospectively, back to 30 June last year. That is always something we have to consider. However, on this occasion it is a change which is to the benefit of members of superannuation funds and their members, so Labor is supportive of the retrospective aspect of this bill as well as of the contents of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that measures contained in this bill are being applied back some 15 months is evidence that the government is not treating superannuation with the seriousness that it deserves. It is an issue that should have been dealt with around 30 June 1996, rather than 15

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The measures contained in the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R351">Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  are purely housekeeping ones and, as such, this would have to be the least controversial of all the superannuation bills introduced into this place during the term of this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose for introducing the principal Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act in 1993 was to facilitate a more prudent management of funds held in superannuation by the administrators of the funds. These safeguards were intended to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the sensible supervision of the superannuation industry. I was so keen to make that point that I rose first before the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and caught your eye, Mr Deputy Speaker.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="DEPUTY SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The SI(S) Act undertook to clarify the obligations of trustees in relation to their superannuation entities. In this way the government of the day hoped to boost national savings and encourage self&hyphen;funded retirement by engendering a more positive attitude towards superannuation in the public mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a superannuation fund to come under the SI(S) umbrella, a trustee first has to elect that the fund become regulated under the act and it then has to meet certain criteria. The fact that a fund must meet a range of requirements to come under the SI(S) arrangements supposedly sets it apart from the funds that do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two recent reviews of the behaviour of trustees confirms the need for them to have to meet specified standards of practice. In May 1997, a Coopers and Lybrand survey confirmed that many investors were receiving a lower than expected rate of return on their contributions because their trustees were electing the wrong funds managers to manage their superannuation savings. The implication from the survey was that many super trustees need to develop much greater expertise in choosing fund managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second report, produced by specialist institutional investment adviser Intech Asset Consulting Pty Ltd, was released in August this year. In the words of Mr Barry Dunstan, a journalist with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, it determined that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's managers of superannuation funds' portfolios are struggling, unsuccessfully, to beat the investment averages and are costing trustees and members of superannuation funds hundreds of millions of dollars a year in underperformance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Intech's analysis involved funds to the value of $32 million. It has been estimated that underperformance by the erring fund managers translated into a loss of returns of more than $125 million a year for three years&mdash;a considerable loss in earnings, to be sure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">SI(S) aims to ensure that trustees take an aggressive approach to investment and that diversification is the key to any trustee's business strategy. In this way, the return to account holders will be maximised without the trustee taking extreme and unnecessary risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are four provisions in this amendment, Mr Deputy Speaker, all of which have been operational for seven years but which were subject to a sunset clause which expired on 30 June 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9632"> 1996. I believe there is agreement between the government and the opposition about the value of these measures because the former seeks to bring them into permanent effect through this legislation and the latter is seemingly supportive of that decision, no doubt influenced by its decision earlier to adopt the very same measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also widespread support for this legislation within the taxation community generally, as far as I can ascertain. A recent issue of a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">CCH Tax Week</EMPHASIS> observed that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill contains measures to improve the flexibility of legislative requirements relating to the nature and timing of elections by superannuation funds to be regulated under this act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The financial impact statement suggests that in maintaining the status quo, these measures will have only a nominal impact on future government revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three out of the four provisions in the bill relate to an extension of time available to a trustee to have a fund regulated under SI(S). These amendments will mean that a trustee has 60 days from the date that the fund comes into existence to nominate that it is willing to be regulated under SI(S). This time limit can be extended by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner if deemed to be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extension of this provision and the decision to grant the commissioner this power of discretion is entirely supportable. Schedule 1 of the bill also means to provide a trustee with a 28&hyphen;day threshold, longer if the commissioner agrees to an extension, to amend an invalid election to be regulated under the SI(S) scheme. Importantly, though, this bill will not diminish the standards that must be met in order for a superannuation fund to benefit from the tax concession offered through SI(S).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under section 42 of the act a fund will still have to demonstrate that its sole or primary purpose is to provide old age pensions&mdash;to use the wording in the explanatory memorandum&mdash;thus preventing an erosion of the integrity of the superannuation system. The third effect of the bill will be to allow a superannuation fund that is in the process of being wound up to be regulated under SI(S) even if the trustee has not elected this regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the trustee must previously have notified the ISC of the decision to wind up the fund. In this way, Mr Deputy Speaker, superannuation funds will continue to be protected by and receive the tax benefit of SI(S) until such time as the fund is no longer operational. The final amendment will allow the commissioner to extend the time limit for the trustee of a superannuation fund, established before the commencement of the SI(S) Act, to elect that the fund be regulated by SI(S).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already indicated, one of the main aims in formulating the superannuation supervision legislation in 1993 was to consolidate public confidence in the superannuation industry, thereby increasing national savings. The facts are that the majority of Australians remain non&hyphen;savers and they remain ambivalent towards superannuation. This has little to do with the performance of SI(S) and much to do with the frequent and ongoing changes to the superannuation system and the availability of government benefits to middle&hyphen;income Australia. The companies AGB McNair and AC Neilson released a report six months ago which revealed that less than 50 per cent of the Australian population has any form of savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people seriously underestimate the level of savings required to provide an adequate retirement income stream and only seven per cent of the community have savings and investments which total more than $100,000, according to that review. A telling point about the scepticism with which many still regard superannuation: the survey found that, outside the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9633"> family home, most Australians choose bank term deposits over superannuation as the preferred form of saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at Melbourne University also conducted a recent analysis of the attitude towards retirement income in Australia. It found that while the great majority of young Australians expect to maintain financial independence in their retirement this is not reflected in their actual savings behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The survey found that only one in five people aged 18 to 24 were saving towards their retirement and:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Retirement saving is jeopardised by antipathy towards, and ignorance about, superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The survey was reported to have found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current superannuation system repels or confuses 50 per cent of people, with a third . . . saying they would prefer to pay off their debts rather than add to their super.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">During the debate on the superannuation surcharge contributions legislation I noted that since July 1994 there had been a legislative change or Insurance and Superannuation Commission release affecting the operation of superannuation funds once every 6.5 days. That occurred under both Labor and coalition governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The superannuation system has been marked by a phenomenal degree of instability for more than three years. It is small wonder that Australians are not flocking to superannuation as the former Labor government predicted they would. The average Australian simply does not have the confidence in the system, nor does the average Australian believe that their superannuation account will not be targeted by government in future tax grabs. At the time of that debate one leading Perth actuary noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone working in the industry accepts that there are aspects of the existing system which still need to be improved. This needs to be done gradually to rebuild from the position of uncertainty and distrust caused by this incredible pace of change.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That observations remains true today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By putting into permanent effect the four measures contained in this bill it is hoped that there will be more certainty and stability in the operations of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. However, if the government is serious about encouraging Australians to take up superannuation and thereby provide for themselves in retirement then it needs to adopt a more considered and stable approach in its wider superannuation strategies.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to get into a debate as to whether Curtin should precede Chifley or Chifley should precede Curtin. It is a matter of settled Labor history but I say to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), this is an occurrence that I shall not forget too readily!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the honourable member for Curtin and I, as does the opposition, support the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Bill 1997. I am just a little bit surprised that the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) is not on his feet adding his support to these measures as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pick up on some of the observations of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) and the honourable member for Curtin. It is true that under Labor there were quite a few changes to superannuation, but I have to say that one of the things that we on this side of the House took a great deal of pride in was that we took superannuation from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9634"> being the preserve of public servants and the preserve of executives in private enterprise and extended its coverage, made it universal, and transformed superannuation for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that given the rhetoric of the government when in opposition about the importance of national savings, which I concur with, this superannuation measure went a long way to making a real contribution to national savings as well as providing for people in their old age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also true that the now government, when in opposition, complained bitterly about quite a number of changes that we made to superannuation. I concur with the view that we really do need to develop a bipartisan approach to superannuation and minimise all these changes. However, I have to place on record my absolute disappointment, and I suppose anger, if you like, at a number of measures that the government has taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, when in opposition, at the last election, they said that the money that the government had budgeted for in forward estimates as a co&hyphen;payment to the superannuation of ordinary men and women, amounting to $4 billion per annum, which would have lifted their contributions to 15 per cent over time, has been taken away from them: $4 billion has been ripped out of the hands of ordinary working men and women in this country. That has been very difficult for those on this side of the House to absorb because it is patently unfair, grossly unfair. I think it is fair to say that, luckily for the government, they have not paid a penalty for it as yet because I do not think the enormity of that decision, that broken promise, has hit home in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue is this superannuation surcharge, which is a tax but not a tax. Again, we get accused of only being interested in protecting middle&hyphen;class and wealthier people and, of course, that is not the case. The execution of this 15 per cent surcharge will see enormous administrative costs and a messy application. I think it is ironic that in the package of bills that went through yesterday about the 15 per cent surcharge that no&hyphen;one could tell us what the impact will be. The actuaries have not worked that out, and particularly, if I may say so, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the superannuation fund that you and I belong to. The real irony is that federal judges and federal politicians will be paying it but we do not know whether state politicians and state judges will be paying it. I would be very interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) elucidate and fill in that knowledge gap that I have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think these two measures are very draconian. I have neglected to say that, given the changes that are occurring in the economy&mdash;that is, the rate at which we are shedding full&hyphen;time jobs and replacing them with part&hyphen;time jobs&mdash;those people who are receiving a superannuation payout, on modest incomes are, of course, being caught up in the surcharge. So ordinary men and women are being caught up in the surcharge, not just those who earn over $70,000. I think that change is to be very much regretted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think what the honourable member for Curtin said is true: people are now starting to opt out of superannuation. In fact, it is much better for someone like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to be negative gearing and putting assets or money aside, and getting income from those sorts of things rather than from superannuation. I think that is regrettable. I think it is regrettable that all you will be getting now is about a three per cent return on superannuation. In terms of superannuation, instead of seeing a steady climb in the value of the nation's accumulated savings, we will be seeing it doing a turn. This is quite contrary to the rhetoric of the government when in opposition&mdash;that was, emphasising the importance of national savings 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9635"> and personal savings. It also means that, in an ageing population, rather than the pension becoming a safety net for a decreasing number of older Australians, it will increasingly be drawn on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As the member for Chifley, it would be remiss of me not to point out that the actions of the Howard government in relation to superannuation mirror precisely the actions of the Menzies government in relation to the changes that Chifley introduced in terms of the national welfare fund. Here was a fund every working Australian had to pay into, and it was shown separately from income tax. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when you talk to pensioners in your electorate they will remember the national welfare fund and will tell you about it. They will get very stroppy when you talk about an age pension, because they quite rightly say, `We contributed to that out of our earnings.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what did Menzies do? The first thing he did was to abolish the separation: that is to say, people would not be shown their contributions into the national welfare fund separately from the income tax they were paying. Then, of course, he had the money go straight into consolidated revenue and left the national welfare fund as a mere shell, with no money in it at all. It is not surprising to me, although it deeply grieves and saddens me, to see that some really key changes that the Howard government has brought in have destroyed some of the good work that we had done in terms of superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the very short time left to me, there are a couple of things I want to say. One is that on the Labor side, of course, there is always a debate about whether, in terms of their fiduciary responsibility, the directors or the trustees of a superannuation fund should always go exclusively for the best interests of their members&mdash;the highest return for their members&mdash;or whether it is more appropriate to encourage superannuation funds to devote some of their money to developing innovative industry that will sow the seeds of a real future for Australia: buying some of the economic farm back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would always argue that the first duty of the trustees is to ensure that the fund itself is very sound and well managed. But I do say that governments, whether conservative or Labor, have a responsibility to see in what way they can encourage a portion of those funds to be going into what could certainly otherwise be called a slightly higher risk than their traditional blue chip investments are. I must say that, in talking to workers on the factory floor or in retailing or whatever, I find they are quite comfortable with the idea that some of their funds should go to promoting Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least, the opposition is looking forward to seeing the Wallis reforms and legislation being enacted and to seeing how the prudential supervision of banks, credit unions, superannuation companies and insurance companies is going to operate. No doubt we will be seeing, in the new year, changes to the very legislation that we are now enacting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I have to say that from my perspective I am not convinced that, whether in banking, insurance or superannuation, we have got everything right in terms of consumer protections and the ability of consumers to make legitimate complaints against their funds and to have those funds' actions fully examined. Certainly, as a federal member, I have had dealings with the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, and they have been very helpful in terms of the cases that I have brought to their attention. But I cannot say that I am satisfied that consumers have, under either us or the new government, the full protection that they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think that there is an issue of accountability here, so that the trustees or directors of a superannuation fund do report to their fund contributors. It does not matter whether we are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9636"> talking about banks or superannuation companies or insurance companies: I am one who believes that there ought to be a public process of accountability whereby not only individuals but also organisations that are formed to represent individuals have an opportunity to cross&hyphen;examine these funds, banks or insurance companies about their actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Wallis legislation comes before the House, I, as one member of this House, will be taking a great deal of interest to see not only how the prudential and fiduciary responsibilities of these organisations are provided for in the legislation, but will be watching the public accountability of these organisations. After all, they do husband the savings of a nation and the consumer protection that is provided in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have say I do not believe merely giving coverage ACCC to look at the operations of these organisations is providing adequate consumer protection. I mean no disrespect to ACCC, whom I was corresponding with quite recently. But why they have the `C' representing consumer in their name is beyond me. I think it is a complete misnomer. It is very confusing to the public and very little of their operation really has to do with consumer protection. In conclusion, we are supporting this legislation, even though the government appears not to have speakers in support of it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I just want to make a few brief comments in summing up and to challenge the opposition on whether the superannuation industry is still growing and being an effective instrument for people putting in their savings. The opposition have indicated that really superannuation has lost its edge as a place for investing in and that somehow we might be wrecking this. I am reminded of a quote on May 12 by Senator Sherry about the government. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every action they have taken, every law they have attempted to enact in respect of superannuation since they came into government, has had the effect of wrecking superannuation, wrecking confidence and wrecking the final payout from workers' superannuation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is that as a year on year increase?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BI4">Mr MILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a year on year increase, 20 per cent during l996&hyphen;1997. That is a pretty big increase. It is over $304 billion now and about $60 billion went in during the last year. That is a huge investment into superannuation. I just do not think we can actually say in any respect that the action taken by this government is wrecking superannuation when people are voting with their feet to put money into the superannuation schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could tease this out a little bit. When you have a look at who is putting in, the strongest growth came from member contributions, not from the employers. They increased by 17 per cent, whereas employer contributions increased by 10 per cent. I think Australians are voting with their feet. They are confident about the management of the superannuation industry by the present government. I just wanted to make the point very strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is growth. Australians are still involved in superannuation. The member for Chifley (Mr Price) indicated that there was considerable growth into superannuation while his party was in government. That is true. I remember someone quoting yesterday&mdash;and you should have been down there in the debate yesterday to find out the information. From 40 per cent of the population to 90 per cent or something like that has been quoted.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9637">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think all of us in this place would welcome that people are now involved. But I want to say here that not only did that increase occur but it has been maintained in the way in which people are being involved in superannuation. I just want to make that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Chifley did ask some question which related to the debate yesterday, but seeing this is a very pleasant debating chamber, I will answer that question here. That is that state members will be taxed on the 15 per cent surcharge and those incoming state judges will also come within the ambit of the 15 per cent surcharge&mdash;not the present judges, just like the present High Court judges, but the ones coming in. That is the answer to that question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just in summarising, there was also another query about why it has taken the government 20 months to bring this legislation in. Can I just say that there was legislation which was brought into the parliament in the spring of 1995. It was passed at that time but this was not part of that legislation. I do not think the present opposition have any room to complain about the government actually bringing this legislation in now. It has been given a T status for getting this legislation through. It does have a priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do welcome the opposition's support for these measures and the recognition of the importance of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act in regulating the conduct of the trustees of superannuation entities to ensure prudent management of superannuation moneys. This amendment bill will provide more flexibility in the administration of the election of provisions under the superannuation legislation. The measures are necessary to respond to the expiry of discretionary powers and ensure superannuation benefits in otherwise complying funds are not eroded through the loss of taxation concessions.

I have taken the opportunity of alerting the responsible minister, the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer, of the amendments, so I hope he has had some notice of them as well. I have also indicated that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9638"> when this bill is returned to the House I am proposing to move an amendment in the committee stage to effect the thrust of the second reading amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997 and the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 facilitate the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;electric Authority, as agreed in 1995 between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments. The corporatisation thrust of this legislation had been agreed by those on this side when we were in government and, as will become clear in the course of members hearing my remarks and reading the proposed amendments, it is not the corporatisation thrust of the legislation with which the opposition has difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rationale for the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Authority was outlined by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in the second reading speech; in effect it will enable the authority, under its new corporate entity, Snowy Hydro Ltd, to participate fully in the emerging competitive national electricity market. This, of course, is an important thrust to ensure a national electricity market, to ensure competition amongst energy sources. This has been part of a general thrust which on this side of the chamber we have been engaged in since as early as 1990&hyphen;91 to bring more effective national focus and competition to our energy sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nature of the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;electric Authority is that complementary legislation is required in the Victorian and New South Wales parliaments and that has occurred. The Victorian legislation is expected to be passed by the Victorian house in due course. The New South Wales legislation has unfortunately fallen foul of those things known as upper houses which, with the greatest of respect to our colleagues, no self&hyphen;respecting member of the House of Representatives has much time for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, from time to time, some minority members can come up with a reasonable report, and I will refer to that subsequently. An amended version of the New South Wales legislation is expected to be introduced into the New South Wales parliament later this year or early next year. The structure of the legislation is that the Commonwealth legislation cannot be proclaimed until the complementary bills are passed in those jurisdictions and an independent water inquiry on the water flow of the Snowy has been conducted. It is that aspect which goes to the heart the amendment, which I will move in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills terminate the existing legislative arrangements in relation to the Snowy scheme and form a new company, the Snowy Hydro Ltd. The Snowy Hydro will manage and operate the Snowy Mountains scheme and the Commonwealth and two state governments will have shares respectively in the new company&mdash;New South Wales 58 per cent, Victoria 29 per cent and the Commonwealth 13 per cent. The charter given to the Snowy Hydro Ltd is to generate electrical energy and market that energy and related service on a strictly commercial basis in the national electricity market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To digress from the objects and purpose of the legislation, this is consistent with the thrust to bring competition to our energy sources. It is not just gas on gas. It is gas on electricity and it is electricity on electricity irrespective of the way in which electricity is generated whether that be hydro, coal, gas or co&hyphen;generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To continue with the Snowy Hydro's principal purposes, it is also to operate on a financially viable basis in accordance with the corporate plan approved by its members and to undertake any future developments and operations that are commercially viable and that are agreed by the board.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9639">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as transitional arrangements are concerned, one thing which is always important on this side of the chamber is that all current Snowy Mountain Authority staff will be offered transfer to Snowy Hydro Ltd with no net loss of their benefits or their entitlements. In addition to that, the corporatisation process will enable the facilitation of repayment of substantial debt owed by the Snowy Mountains Authority to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the nature of the geography of the Snowy, Snowy Hydro Ltd will be governed by New South Wales law and the obvious and relevant laws are those in respect of planning, water and the environment. The heart of the thrust of the amendment which I foreshadowed goes to the conducting of a water inquiry into the Snowy water flow. While the Commonwealth legislation does not expressly provide for it, corporatisation principles which have been agreed between the Commonwealth and the states, and which are appended to the explanatory memorandum, provide for the establishment of a public water inquiry under the auspices of the New South Wales and Victorian governments into issues arising out of the current pattern of the Snowy River water flows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this side of the chamber, the question of water distribution between electricity, environment, irrigation, aspects or needs had not been resolved by the time we left office. The corporatisation principles which are, as I say, incorporated in the explanatory memorandum, go to the heart of the water inquiry at paragraphs 8.1 and 8.2 of the corporatisation principles. Paragraph 8.2 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry will submit to the States comprehensive, costed options to address the issues considered by the inquiry within six months of its commencement. Thereafter, the States will consider the final report of the inquiry and agree upon a final outcome within two months or such other time as may be agreed by them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is the establishment of the inquiry, its outcome and the implementation of its recommendations which are the focus of the amendment. I have kept a watchful eye on the clock, Mr Deputy Speaker. This may well be the most appropriate time to indicate that I seek leave to continue my remarks when debate resumes and, at the conclusion of my remarks, I will formally move the amendment that I foreshadowed.</PARA>
