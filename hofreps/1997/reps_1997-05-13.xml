I sent a message to her this morning. I know the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) will share in full the congratulations that I convey. She finished the swim in 24 hours 31 minutes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will come to that in a moment. The failure of the organisers of that meeting to pay the courtesy of inviting the local member, the member for Paterson, or Newcastle based Senator John Tierney to that meeting just demonstrates what an empty political exercise it really was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say to the people of Newcastle and the Hunter Valley that along with, I am sure, all other Australians the government deeply regrets that BHP will close its steel operations at Newcastle. I want to say to the people of Newcastle and the Hunter Valley that we do not intend to abandon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noticed over the last week, since this announcement was made, this hypocritical posturing by the Labor Party. It reached its zenith when the member for Hotham, the spokesman on industry, had this to say&mdash;just listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Had Labor still been in government, what was announced two weeks ago would not have happened.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the greatest piece of nonsense!</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it passes very strange that the member for Hotham should make that statement, because the Premier of New South Wales had this to say on 29 April, the day after BHP made its announcement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's got to be said that this is being done predominantly because of BHP's assessment of global factors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Hotham knows that and the Leader of the Opposition knows that, yet they parade themselves around the country pretending that, if some alternative approach had perhaps been in vogue, then the outcome would have been different.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="THOMSON" NAMEID="UK6">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's exactly right.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You interject, `That's exactly right.' The Leader of the Opposition quoted the national secretary of the Labor Party a moment ago. On 18 October last year the national secretary of the Labor Party made an extremely interesting speech. It was addressed to the South Australian conference of the Australian Labor Party. He had this to say&mdash;and I want all members to listen to this, particularly those who represent electorates in the Hunter Valley and particularly people who live in the Newcastle area who might be duped into believing that the member for Hotham has some new, alternative, better plan for looking after their future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham has been for 20 years part of the problem that caused the Newcastle BHP plant to close down. You were part of the problem when you ran the trade union movement and you were a major part of the problem when you were a member of the Keating and Hawke ministries. So you are the last bloke who can come into this House and pretend that you have a solution. This is what Gary Gray had to say, and it really is worth listening to. This is very interesting. He said:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">spoken like a true economic rationalist&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">comes to determine whether Western Mining, or BHP, or General Motors or Penfolds Wine put their money into South Australia, or Argentina or Indonesia . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">No talk there about the Labor Party's alternative industry policy. No suggestion that if Labor were in office they would have such an attractive industry policy. The reality of the situation is that the forces that led to the closure of the BHP plant have been in the system for a very long time. Any attempt by the member for Hotham to blame the present government is completely dishonest and completely contemptible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But can I say to the member for Paterson that I had a meeting last week with the Premier of New South Wales regarding a proposal that he has put forward which would involve a contribution by the federal government, a contribution by the state government and also a contribution by BHP. Let me say in relation to that that the federal government has decided to commit some resources towards programs to deal with the particular problems that have arisen. We are not attracted to the proposal put by the New South Wales government. The proposal put by the New South Wales government is short term, it is gimmicky and it will not provide any long-term relief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I intend to do is to be part of a joint committee with the New South Wales government to examine the alternatives. There is a period of two years before the major impact of the retrenchments will come into effect. I want to say to the people of the Hunter Valley that the resources that we commit will be equal to those promised by the New South Wales government, but we will do it in a way that is more effective. We are not going to embrace a knee&hyphen;jerk solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also believe that BHP has a very significant responsibility. BHP&mdash;although warning governments of both persuasions, as those on the frontbench well know, that steel making was not going to continue indefinitely at Newcastle&mdash;failed to give adequate notice of the particular date of the closure. Despite all the lofty rhetoric and all the gimmicks that are coming from those who sit opposite, they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were part of the problem that caused the BHP closure. They were part of the problem for 20 years. Any attempt to try to shift it to us is absolute humbug and it will not wash with the battlers of Newcastle.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Earlier this year the government introduced the landmark workplace relations act to free up the industrial relations system. In addition, the Prime Minister's small business statement in March of this year contained a provision to ease the unfair dismissal laws. Could the Prime Minister inform the House whether all small business in Australia, including in my electorate of Griffith, will enjoy the benefits of these important reforms?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3347" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is that, in relation to people under federal awards, as a result of a decision that has been taken by the Labor Party today&mdash;and if that decision, as is likely, is supported by the Australian Democrats and by Senator Harradine&mdash;we are going 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3348"> to see more jobs destroyed than will be lost in Newcastle in two-years time. There is all this talk about Newcastle. Your decision to block that unfair dismissal proposal will cost thousands of jobs in small business. If you disagree with me, you ought to remember the criticism of the Premier of New South Wales, who at least speaks from the authority of elected office, of the unfair dismissal laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we proposed was a measure whereby any small business employing fewer than 15 people would be completely exempted from the unfair dismissal laws in relation to people who had been employed for less than 12 months. What this did was to introduce a very effective level of flexibility, a very valuable incentive for small business to take on more staff. I want to say to those who sit opposite that this is the most anti-jobs decision you have taken in the 13 months you have been in opposition. You stand up in this parliament and you talk about Newcastle. You stand up in this parliament and talk about job creation schemes. But you have an opportunity to support a measure that is going to create thousands of jobs in the small business sector and what do you do? You roll it over and you say no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is very instructive what the reaction to the federal government's announcement was. Let me share with the House the reaction of people to the announcement made by the federal government. This is what Mr Rob Bastion of the Council of Small Business Organisations had to say on 24 March:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The small business exemption from the unfair dismissal laws is obviously the jewel in the crown. That is the one that will actually create jobs and I am certain of it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, you have the spokesman for small business saying that our proposal would create jobs. Then, interestingly, the shadow minister for small business, the member for Cunningham, came along on 5 March. This is what he had to say, and it is very, very interesting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suspect that there is a lot of political heat that might be generated against us should we take a negative view on this particular issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. You were right on that. They should have listened to you. Didn't you have a very eloquent argument? Did Martin roll you, did he? I am sure he did, because he was there as the proxy for Jennie George. On 24 March, Jennie George said&mdash;listen to the self-confidence of the born puppeteer:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am assuming that the Labor Party will do the right thing by the union movement, but not the right thing by the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course the Labor Party will always do the right thing by the union movement, but never the right thing by the unemployed. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am assuming that the Labor Party will do the right thing and do what we are doing&mdash;opposing the extension of these unfair dismissal exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Really! She then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Labor Party senator was heard to be endorsing it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Can I just make it very, very clear that the government will persevere with this particular decision. If it is voted down in the Senate, let every small business in Australia know, let every unemployed young person know, that the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and any Independent senator that supports the disallowance motion will be opposing job opportunities for young Australians. They will be voting against the interests of small business. They will be voting to keep in place a measure that every observer of small business regards as anathema to the employment prospects of young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let it be understood that, in the very first question time of this new sitting, the great blow that the Labor Party has struck today in favour of reducing unemployment is to undermine the capacity of small business to take on staff and to destroy the job prospects of thousands of young Australians.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To the last part of the question, the answer is no. To the general question, the fact of the matter is that this measure is pro jobs. This is going to say to people who are employing people in Queensland that the government is going to put in place a system which is fair both to small business and to employees. The end result of that is a pro jobs growth policy for Queensland. I publicly compliment and applaud the initiative 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3350"> of the Queensland government with the support of the Independent, Liz Cunningham, in Queensland to ensure that this is the law in respect of unfair dismissals in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also take the opportunity to commend publicly the initiative of the South Australian government which, likewise, is taking up the proposition initiated by the Prime Minister to introduce the same exemption in respect of small business. I compliment particularly Dean Brown and the Premier, John Olsen, for taking this up on behalf of small business. The effect in those two states alone provides a significant benefit to businesses which together employ something like 520,000 Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the Labor Party have announced today that they are not prepared to support this measure. I must say, I am absolutely amazed. Let's remember the potted history of the unfair dismissal law. Before the 1996 election, Keating said that industrial relations would be the big issue for Labor during the 1996 election. As a result of the very strong opposition and concern in the small business community about unfair dismissal, Keating had to announce a review of Labor's unfair dismissal policy during the 1996 election campaign. In 1996, we introduced a remedial set of reforms to the unfair dismissal law. You opposed the sensible measures to clean up the mess that you had created and now, when we introduce a sensible measure, against the political advice of your own spokesperson for small business, you have today announced this policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We already have exemptions in the unfair dismissal law. Even in the faulty, deficient, hopeless scheme that Labor had, they had exemptions for certain categories of employees. The idea of exemptions is nothing new. What we are proposing is consistent with the international standard. We are not alone on this. There are Germany, the UK, Italy&mdash;you name it. Many others with similar standards to us who also adopt international standards have exactly this exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the overall, the changes that we have made in respect of unfair dismissal have been a tremendous boost already to small business. We have seen in the federal jurisdiction the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> introduction of a filing fee, we have a cost jurisdiction against vexatious applicants and we have seen across the board a 56 per cent drop in federal applications. All of that is a much better deal for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the opposition: you will politically regret this decision. We do not intend to let up on this issue. If you do proceed with your intentions to disallow this regulation in the Senate, we will give favourable consideration to introducing legislation into this House. We are not going to let this issue go. The fact of the matter is that this is a fair deal for both employers and employees. We are doing this because, unlike you, we are interested in genuine measures that are going to help in the creation of jobs in this country and we are not going to let you forget it.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Given that the government's unfair dismissal laws have been in practise for some months, are you aware that the ABS figures released today show 246,400 people on the long&hyphen;term unemployment queue? This month saw the biggest single one&hyphen;month jump in long&hyphen;term unemployment since your government was elected. Regional ABS data shows 16,800 additional people in regional Australia joined the unemployment queues last month. Jobs and job security are Australia's No. 1 concern.

I will tell the member for Batman this: there is going to be a big connection between the long&hyphen;term unemployed figure in a year's time and the decision you took this morning. That will be the connection. What you decided this morning was to condemn thousands more young Australians, in particular, to the unemployment scrap heap.

Would the minister inform the House about the successful conclusion of the sale of long&hyphen;term leases for the operation of Melbourne, Perth and, most importantly the airport in my own electorate of Lilley, Brisbane? Minister, what are the benefits of the sale for Australian taxpayers and for the stakeholders in the airport?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lilley for her question. I am pleased to inform the House today of the highly successful entering into contracts for the sale of the long&hyphen;term leases for Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports. The process was highly competitive and rigorous and the new operators will prove to be committed, innovative and capable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total achieved from the three airports was $3.3 billion. Brisbane Airport Corporation Ltd paid $1.387 billion for the lease of Brisbane airport; Australian Pacific Airports Corporation paid $1.307 billion for the lease of Melbourne airport; and Airstralia Development Group paid $643 million for the lease of Perth airport. The government is pleased with these sale proceeds. Of course, I can assure the House that the benefit for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian taxpayer is that this government will not fund current expenditure with those proceeds; the proceeds will be used to retire debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to point out that the sale price, whilst it was a very important factor in the bid evaluation, was not the only criteria. Non&hyphen;price criteria included management capacity, financial strength, commitment to infrastructure development and certainty and clarity of bid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note an interjection to comment on the comments of the Victorian Premier in respect of this sale. I noted with interest that, a week prior to the third bidder being announced, the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, went on Melbourne radio and indicated that he had some concerns about the process. He indicated that he felt that there was a gross abuse of the system. It would appear that he was expressing concerns allegedly made by one of the unsuccessful consortia, the Macquarie Bank. I invited him to give me any evidence of where there was any breakdown in the process. I have not received any, and I do not expect to. After the process was completed, I received a letter from the Macquarie Bank which stated that the bank had absolute faith in the integrity of the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can further say that, at the end of all this, like all asset sales, the Australian National Audit Office will undertake scrutiny of the process. I have not the slightest doubt that it will come through in the most outstanding fashion.

I am advised by my department that, to achieve anything like the 53.6 per cent figure that has been suggested, Australia would need a migration program averaging many hundreds of thousands a year and one which was almost totally from one particular source, namely, Asia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another example of the Labor Party taxing a progressive industry, one of the best employers in Australia. Indeed, the new 10 per cent bed tax is a body blow to tourism and compares with the 1989 pilots strike. It is a blatant revenue raiser 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which discriminates against the tourism industry and, in particular, the accommodation sector. The taxation will have an overall effect of destroying jobs, destroying investment and affecting overall potential for tourist visitors for the Olympic year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not be fooled by the accusations of the government. They have not excluded guesthouses, they have not excluded the backpacker hotels and they have not excluded the high yield short&hyphen;stay cruises. What they have done is to jeopardise the fastest growing industry in Australia and the best providers of jobs for young Australians. What they have done is to place at risk future investment in this industry. Just to demonstrate this, I quote from the ASX's tourism and leisure price index, which has dropped over 80 points since the 10 per cent bed tax came in. The New South Wales government will raise approximately $64 million by this action. It will be applied to consolidated revenue and to reducing their debt structure, not to promoting the tourist industry, which it should be doing. As a consequence of that lack of promotion for tourism in New South Wales and the extra tax which has been placed on it, the government should recant and reverse its position.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and, if I may say so, for his enduring interest in foreign affairs and trade issues. As the member suggests, I did attend on behalf of the Australian government in place of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade the APEC trade ministers meeting in Montreal at the end of last week. The Australian government's objectives at the APEC ministers meeting were very much fulfilled. One of our key objectives was to ensure that there was an improvement in the individual action plans that the 18 member economies had put forward, and it was agreed at the APEC trade ministers meeting that improved individual action plans would be put forward to the August senior officials meeting so that, by the time the leaders meet at the end of the year, those improved individual action plans can be presented to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second achievement of the meeting, which was an important achievement, was to agree to develop further sectoral initiatives for what you might call turbocharged trade liberalisation. The Australian government suggested that amongst the sectoral initiatives included should be initiatives in the area of energy&mdash;and I think there was good support for that&mdash;and also processed foods, non&hyphen;ferrous metals and one or two other sectors as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, it was decided that senior officials would give consideration to what sort of sectoral initiatives could be taken up. By the time the leaders meet in November of this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3355"> year, it will be possible for the leaders to agree on work in particular sectors so that APEC does not just depend on the individual action plans but has accelerated areas of activity. We saw some of that last year with the information technology and basic telecommunications agreements, and I think we will get more progress this year in some other sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the Australian government has for some time, including under the previous government, promoted a concept called the APEC business travel card. Contrary to a report that appeared in a newspaper a day or two ago, the APEC business travel card is gradually being endorsed by an increasing number of economies. Already Australia, the Philippines and the Republic of Korea have adopted the APEC business travel card and a trial for that travel card is now beginning. It was indicated to us at the APEC meeting that Hong Kong would certainly be adopting the business travel card, and Chile and Thailand as well are looking at doing so. So, although it perhaps has not developed as fast as one might like, it is certainly developing and developing successfully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, and I think this will be of interest to all members of the House, the Australian government promoted at the meeting an initiative, which really came from the Prime Minister at the time of the APEC leaders meeting, for APEC economies to promote the merits of trade liberalisation. It was agreed that senior officials would consider how this could be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two aspects of it, I think, are very important, and I made this point clear to the APEC trade ministers meeting. First of all, people around the APEC economies need to understand the direct benefits to them of trade liberalisation. But, secondly, people around the APEC economies need to understand that each of those 18 economies is going through this process of liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most common reactions from APEC trade and foreign ministers during this meeting was that they heard from their own constituencies the cry, `Why are we liberalising while no&hyphen;one else is?' They all hear this from all of their constituencies. The fact is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that all APEC members are going through this process of liberalisation and the problem is that there are, in each of those 18 economies, a few people who choose not to understand what liberalisation is taking place in the rest of the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This project will help to explain that, even to the simplest of people who do not wish to understand the benefits of trade liberalisation. The meeting was a great success. Australia's objectives were all fulfilled and I believe that APEC is developing very strongly and very successfully.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. During the parliamentary break, the Leader of the Opposition made the long expected decision to dump the former shadow minister for education, the member for Sydney. He was not much good in that portfolio, I suppose. He had asked, I think, five questions on higher education during his time in the portfolio. During that recess, the Leader of the Opposition appointed the member for Werriwa, a protege of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the new shadow minister has got off to a very bad start. I recall that on 20 August last year the member for Werriwa said that battling families would have to face the prospect of a two-tiered higher education system in which in Australia 35,000 growth places would be lost to the sector. I have to say that, throughout the last four or five months when he has been moving in on the member for Sydney as the opposition spokesman on education, he has been one of those voices baying against the reforms that have been put in place by Senator Vanstone in the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has been spreading the notion that places are being restricted, that access is being restricted to students wanting to enter Australia's universities. Nothing could be further from the truth. Let me inform the opposition and the member for Werriwa that, on the most recent information available to the government, there has been an increase of almost 12,000 undergraduates in Australian universities this year. Universities have overenrolled some 26,500 undergraduates. So much for restricted access to Australia's universities! Not only that, the total funding available to Australian universities has also increased over last year. Total Commonwealth operating grant funding for universities in 1997 was up $147 million. Indeed, the government estimates that the university sector is now deriving some $250 million 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more revenue from teaching activities this year than last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year when the government brought down its reforms, it informed this parliament and the Australian people that its reforms would mean more university places and more funding for Australian universities by giving the universities the flexibility which your party, the Labor Party, consistently denied them. The fact is the government has delivered on that promise. Senator Vanstone's reforms, the government's reforms, have worked. There are more undergraduates in Australian universities today&mdash;12,000 more than there were last year&mdash;and total university resources are up. That is a very bad start for the new shadow minister for education.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Petrie for her question. As the member would know, I have visited many small businesses, particularly in Queensland and in the member's electorate. These small businesses have welcomed the government's initiatives&mdash;particularly, I might add, in the area of the capital gains tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The capital gains tax provisions will soon flow through. Small businesses appreciate the flexibility to grow their businesses but, more particularly, they appreciate the opportunity for them to build-up their small businesses for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3358"> a retirement nest egg. A husband and wife can sell their business capital gains tax free and, as of 1 July, what can flow to them will be $1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What small businesses are bitterly disappointed about particularly is the Labor Party's decision to block our unfair dismissal provisions. When meeting the small business community in Petrie, they told me that that was the greatest block to them employing young Australians. I might add that the shadow minister recently said that he suspected, `A lot of political heat might be generated against us if we take a negative view on this particular provision.' You are quite right. The small business people want this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the previous shadow minister, Senator Cook, in answering a question at a doorstop said that, before taking a position on this matter, he would consult the small business community. I would love to know who the small business people were he consulted who told him that they were quite happy to leave in place the unfair dismissal provisions that Labor put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the small business community wanted the unfair dismissal provisions stripped away&mdash;just as the Prime Minister has provided for small business in other ways, including the capital gains tax rollover, the small business innovation fund and the cutting of red tape and compliance. Small business has recognised that we have cleared the way. The initiatives are in place. Low inflation and low interest rates are locked in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are now starting to see the benefit of that growth, the benefit of those initiatives, the benefit of the stripping away of the unfair dismissal provisions&mdash;the compliance provisions that we are stripping away and that you are voting against&mdash;and of course the benefit of the capital gains tax rollover.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3359"> him that the three Medicare offices in his electorate are secure. The government has made a decision not to close any Medicare offices in rural areas, and we have done this after very strong representation from the rural members of the Liberal and National parties. In particular, I thank the member for Mallee for his representation on behalf of his constituents. One thing that was put to me continually by local members was that if you are going to close an office in a country town there is no prospect of the jobs being relocated within that town and that some country people have to travel very substantial distances to get to another Medicare office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are looking to do here is to diversify the way claims can be made. We have electronic data transfer and we have a greater portion of doctors bulk-billing. With the Medicare cash rebate being lost to Medicare offices from 1 January 1998, the volume of claims in Medicare offices is going down&mdash;so much so that one office that we are looking to close in metropolitan Australia was handling only 28 claims a day. Clearly, that is not justifiable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government has decided to close 43 Medicare offices in metropolitan areas. I make no apology for this. This is very simply a transfer of resources from the city to the country. It is very simply an attempt to make sure that all Australians have fair and reasonable access to Medicare claiming. I make no apology for trying to do something to assist people in rural Australia to have better access and to address the neglect that was a result of 13 years of Labor putting Medicare offices in Labor Party seats.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's failure in Newcastle reflects a general failure. It is a failure on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to give leadership, it is a failure to produce a steel plan and it is a failure to produce an industry policy. What we have is a government with no commitment, no compassion and, listening to the answers today from the Prime Minister, no comprehension as to the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister railed today on the basis of asserting that what happened with BHP's announcement a fortnight ago would have happened anyway. He challenged Labor to say how it would have been different. The fact of the matter is that as recently as 1995, when Labor was still in office, BHP recommitted to continuing the steelworks at Newcastle and also to implementing new arc furnace technology either before or thereafter&mdash;in other words, it was a commitment by BHP under Labor to keep steel going in Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the circumstances where the Prime Minister wants to tell us about the 54,000 people employed in BHP in 1982 and the numbers now, but the simple fact is that, if they had been returned to power in 1983, BHP would have been out the door then. In 1983 BHP was threatening to close Newcastle, to close Whyalla and even threatening to close Port Kembla. So the 54,000 jobs would have gone to zero had Labor not been elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With Labor being elected in 1983, we sought immediate talks with BHP. We developed the steel plan and we saved Newcastle. We saved Newcastle and we saved Whyalla. We not only saved them but we saw significant new investment into steel making in this country&mdash;investment in steel making and growth in steel exports. Steel exports are still Australia's No. 1 manufacturing export, so there is a demand for our product. We can be there and we can be competitive, but only if you have a government prepared to back the industry in this country. This is a government that will not do it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the circumstances in 1983 where Labor saved Newcastle. Had Labor been returned at the last election, we would have saved Newcastle on this occasion. Why? Because we would have held BHP to its commitment made in 1995&mdash;a commitment to keep steel making going in Newcastle. Is that the approach this government takes&mdash;this hands-off government, this rudderless government, this government that shows no leadership on anything that counts in this country and this government that is only ever forced to do anything in terms of jobs or industry when Labor pushes them to the barrier?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the example of the shipbuilding industry, where we had the minister time and time again getting up and saying, `We are going to abolish the ships bounty; they don't need it.' Who was at the forefront of that campaign? It was Labor, and we got it restored.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister laughs. The minister would have had no capacity in his own right to get that policy up. He goes around oozing these words about how good he is for industry but cannot deliver a cracker. He can go and let off the crackers down at the casino instead of going to the Newcastle workers, but he cannot deliver a thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me have a look at the Prime Minister's role in this regard because he is the one to blame. He is the one who has to assert leadership because of the incompetent Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is at the table, not having any ability to win an argument through the cabinet. We have John Howard, the Prime Minister of the country, oozing concern at the closure of Newcastle. This is what he had to say; this is his pathetic response the day after the Newcastle closure. He goes on Ray Martin's show and he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm very sorry for the people of Newcastle. I hope to go to that city soon.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3364"> program to say he is going to go there. Ray Martin says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is that enough for you to go and say you're sorry?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The dissembling Prime Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well well look on its own it is at this stage all I can do Ray. It is the antithesis of good government for me a day after the announcement without having been there, without having listened to people, without having been properly advised to sort of off the top of my head make a whole string of promises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't deliver miracles, I can't reverse BHP's decision . . . </PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the Prime Minister of the country&mdash;hasn't got a clue, hasn't got a solution, hasn't got a suggestion except the comfort words of `I'll go', but they are still waiting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a Prime Minister acting true to form. Back in 1982, when BHP was threatening the Fraser government with closing its steelworks at Newcastle, John Howard, then Treasurer, was in hiding. We know at least Malcolm Fraser had a bit of commitment to the manufacturing industry in this country. He was a bit of a supporter of some intervention in industry, but the Prime Minister was under pressure not to help BHP. He took the unusual step of insisting upon a vote in the cabinet&mdash;a vote of every member so he would not be left out on a limb. Who was absent? The present Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister tells us today that he was not absent. I would like him to check the record or at least check with Mr Alan Woods, who has written this piece. But more to the point: if he was there, how did he vote? I bet he voted against Newcastle because he is voting against them now. He says that he has compassion for the workers of Newcastle, but he won't attend, won't lift a finger for them, won't do a thing. He hid then and he is hiding now. He simply is not on the landscape so far as Newcastle is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister also tells us that he has known for ages that this was going to happen. It makes the crime even worse. If he knew for all that time, why didn't he lift a finger? Why didn't he actually get BHP to the table and ask what we could do to secure the future of the steel industry in this country? BHP has invested in an arc furnace, but where has it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> invested? It has invested in Ohio, USA. And why? Because Ohio, USA offered them free land, a tax holiday and a new road. The Newcastle arc furnace is in Ohio because this government has let it go there. This government is not committed to supporting the steel making industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the Prime Minister's pathetic press release on the day of the BHP announcement? The press release's final sentence&mdash;I think it can be divided into two; I think there is a bit of a typo, but these are the Prime Minister's words which were actually put to print&mdash;says `I refuse to promise anything'&mdash;that is, to the people of Newcastle&mdash;and then `I cannot deliver to the families of Newcastle and the Hunter'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why should this person be elected again? Why should a person who is not prepared to lift a finger and not prepared to do a thing to assist the families, the work force and the future of Newcastle be treated seriously in any future election?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now come to his industry minister, who is at the table&mdash;the man who has left this yawning gap in industry policy, the one who has editorials around the country as well as the business community united around this country calling for an industry policy&mdash;the people that he refers to as `village galahs'. I tell you what, Minister: there is a decent flock, in plague proportions in your case, heading to Canberra, but you would not know because you are either out to lunch or ensconced over in the Commonwealth Club. We know about the minister's discussion at the Commonwealth Club with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) about the future of the car industry. The discussion was, `Let's let Mitsubishi go.' Again he is true to form because the other day he said, `Let's let Newcastle go.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They could not find the minister on the day of the announcement. Where was he? He was out to another long lunch. We know this minister likes long lunches. He was over at The Tryst, this time supporting the private sector, not the Commonwealth Club. This minister is about dinners at the Commonwealth Club, port and cigars, early retirement to bed&mdash;or at least not having to travel too far. But this day he was at The Tryst for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3365"> lunch. It is one of those places where you can sit outside and be seen. But the minister could not be found. At the end of the day he finally put out a press release in relation to BHP at Newcastle which said, `It is regrettable but we cannot interfere in BHP's commercial decisions.' In other words, what matters is the share price, not the people. The only reason the share price matters to him is that he is into share trading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that this minister will sit by idly and not take any step to keep industry going. The message that I give to the workers and community of Newcastle is: keep the pressure up because this is a government that buckles under pressure. It buckled in relation to the ships bounty. It will buckle in relation to the car industry because we will keep the pressure on and we will make sure that it puts pressure on to secure the future of the steel industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In adding to the disinterest being displayed by this remote dilettante sitting at the table, what does he do instead of accepting an invitation to address the steelworkers in Newcastle? He goes to the casino. And the Prime Minister thinks it was appropriate! Here we have `Black Jack' Moore sprung at the casino sipping the Laurent Perrier. Do honourable members know what his excuse was when someone from Newcastle rang two days before to ask whether he was coming? He was told, `No, the minister won't be there. He's got a very important meeting with the Victorian Premier on Thursday night.' The Victorian Premier was going to be at only one place that Thursday night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister says that he could not have caught a plane up to Newcastle because he had very important meetings. The last plane that he could have caught left Melbourne at 6 o'clock. But, of course, he was already onto his second glass of Laurent Perrier. This is the champagne sipping minister&mdash;no care, no responsibility. Why weren't you there? You are a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have the minister flaunting it again. We have a Prime Minister who hides&mdash;he hid in 1982 and he is hiding today&mdash;but not this minister. He flaunts it. He could not care less and turns up at the casino to gamble 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or looks at the next price increase in BHP shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister was caught out in Bligh Ventures in terms of breaching the Prime Minister's code of conduct. Remember when he said, `No conflict of interest because it's involved in venture capital'? But his own department says he has responsibility for venture capital in this country&mdash;strike 1. Second was Ralston, the private share trading company, and the specific reference to the fact that he trades in shares, disallowed by the Prime Minister's code of conduct. He says, `I'm not in control of Bligh Ventures anymore,' despite the fact that he owns 90 per cent of the ordinary shares and 100 per cent of the redeemable preference shares. You fraud. Now there is the indefensible conduct of turning up at the casino.</PARA>

This is a government that has not lifted a finger for the workers of Newcastle.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Prime Minister said, the local member for Paterson and Senator Tierney were not even given the courtesy of an invitation to attend. I was first informed of the meeting last Monday afternoon&mdash;the Monday before the Thursday&mdash;when it was faxed to my office late that afternoon. I had already committed myself to several important engagements in Melbourne. These included, firstly, a breakfast appointment, a subsequent late meeting, attending the construction industry lunch and making a speech there and meeting the Premier&mdash;not at the casino, but at the Premier's office&mdash;between 2.30 and about 3.15. From 4 o'clock onwards I was at the launch of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratory&mdash;now CSL Ltd&mdash;a privatised company which has done particularly well and is taking advantage of the government's new program, PIIP, to invest over $14 million in further immunisation research and development.</PARA></TALK.START>

Regrettably, I was not given the option of an alternative time by the meeting's organisers. If I had, I would have been only too happy to consider the invitation. It was not physically possible for me to get from Melbourne to Newcastle after my last appointment on Thursday afternoon. The meeting was yet another stunt by the member for Hotham.

It was not intended to be a mechanism to allow the government to consult with the local community. The basic courtesies of such a meeting were not observed. It was intended to do nothing more than be a platform for the member for Hotham.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the opposition, the government is actively pursuing the best options for those affected by the BHP decision. What is important is not political stunts but substance. The government will make it very clear that it is concerned by the closure of the steelworks in Newcastle. The government has a process in place which will deal with those issues at the available time. We will be consulting with the community. We will be examining their proposals and those presented by the member for Paterson and Senator Tierney. We will be asking the Prime Minister's major projects facilitator, Bob Mansfield, to investigate major projects in the region and we will be allowing Newcastle to make long-term plans for its own future. This is of much significance to the people of Newcastle, far more so than any stunt concocted by the member for Hotham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been interesting to watch the member for Hotham since the BHP announcement. As with other significant industry issues, what we have seen is lots of grandstanding&mdash;tonnes of it&mdash;plenty of colour and movement and nothing of substance. As with his approach to industry policy generally, the member for Hotham has plenty of stunts, but no substance. There is colour and movement, but no substance. What is his answer to the BHP closure? What would he have done in this regard? As we have heard today, the member for Hotham has another steel plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go straight to the heart of the proposition. Is a new steel plan the answer to what he is proposing? If it is, what has BHP got to say about this? Is there anything the Commonwealth or state governments can do

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it could be clearer. What does the member for Hotham's colleague, the Premier of New South Wales, believe? When asked about a package to try and change the BHP decision, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's got to be said that this is being done predominantly because of BHP's assessment of global factors at work in steelmaking.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Hotham has no solution. He prefers to grandstand rather than to do the hard work required to develop the policies designed to make Australia an internationally competitive investment location.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems of the steel industry, as with so many other industries, reflect the failure of the industry policy of the last government, of which the member for Hotham was a member. If Labor's policies were so great for the Australian industry, why has BHP made its decision in Newcastle? The so-called Button steel plan did nothing for Newcastle. The economic policies of the last government did nothing for Newcastle. The industry policy of the last government did nothing for Newcastle. The stunts of the member for Hotham do nothing for Newcastle. Yet, he has another steel plan for Newcastle. As the Premier of New South Wales said, international factors, not government policy, are the critical influences in retaining a viable steel industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this situation, the responsibility of the government is clear. It is to ensure that Australia is an internationally competitive investment location. It is to ensure we throw off the shackles and restraints imposed by 13 years of misdirected intervention under the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3368"> Labor government, and it is to ensure we assist and encourage Australian industry to adapt and develop in an internationally competitive investment environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that the policies of the Hawke and Keating governments did not do this. The member for Hotham's latest so-called plan will not do it. Like the government of which he was a member, his so-called policies will again fail Australian industry. They will fail the steel industry and they will fail the people of Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me look briefly at the record of the Button plan, and this is very interesting. You should listen to the record of the Button plan. In the year prior to the plan, 4,000 jobs had been lost in the Newcastle steelworks. You would have thought that the Newcastle area would have been a priority of the previous government at that time. Much has been said about the importance of the Button steel plan to Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the end of 1982, the last year of the Fraser government, BHP steel employment Australia-wide has been reduced from 53,000 to only 30,000. In the year prior to the plan, 4,000 jobs had been lost at the Newcastle steelworks. You would have thought that the Newcastle area would have been the priority for the previous government. Much has been said about the importance of the plan. The steel plan itself applied bounties to five different products. Only one of these was manufactured in Newcastle. Not only that, not one cent was ever paid over the life of the plan to Newcastle for the manufacture of steel product. That stunned you. Not one cent was paid to Newcastle. This is the plan that you are talking about saving Newcastle. Not one cent was paid under the bounty system.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr MOORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You do not, quite clearly. The bulk of the money paid under the bounty in fact went to Port Kembla and to Western Port. During the negotiations of the steel plan, the previous government had been given a very clear indication of where BHP saw their future. What did they do about it? Nothing. They did nothing. They did not get one cent from this much vaunted Button plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, they saw some political opportunity in calming militant unions at Port Kembla and assisting the campaign of Bob Chynoweth in Flinders as far more important than securing jobs in the Newcastle steelworks. Then, as now, the Labor Party attempted to make political mileage out of Newcastle. What Newcastle really needed then was investment in new technology, and the previous government did nothing about that. The fact of the matter is that the Button steel plan failed Newcastle. Let me draw two quotes from the architect of the plan, John Button. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bounty is not designed to make sure that the industry ticks over for another 20 years . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The steel plan is predicated on the assumption that we will have a smaller steel industry than we have had in the past.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was John Button when he launched the plan in the 1980s. Well, Button got his wish because, as a result of his government's lack of foresight, political objectives overrode prudent investment and planning and now, if the latest BHP objectives are carried through, Newcastle will have no steel industry by 1999. The steel plan was designed purely to overcome the political hurdles of the day. It had no intention of delivering long-term outcomes for the Australian steel industry. Button's own words confirm that. His steel plan did nothing for Newcastle. Not one cent of the bounty went to Newcastle. Clearly, the last thing Newcastle needs is another steel plan. BHP have said that, the Premier of New South Wales recognised it, and the government knows that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Newcastle needs is a government which will not only help the people of Newcastle through the transition but also ensure that there is a sustainable future as well. If the member for Hotham is truly concerned, he will end his pathetic political campaigns and get behind the government's plans for industry competitiveness, which includes supporting tonight's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has made a political game out of the BHP announcement and it is backfiring on them. For example, the member for Hotham simply cannot make up his mind how he wants to approach this issue. In 1990, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3369"> for example, the member for Hotham said of the Button plan:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plan finished in 1988 because it was so successful we did not need a subsequent plan.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Now he says we need a second plan. In 1992 the member for Hotham, at the height of the Hunter Valley coal strikes, said:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">In 1997, the member for Hotham said about the new plan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What it should do, is to sit down with the company and say, `You are going to invest somewhere in steel diversification.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That's him again. So we have gone from the plan that is wonderful, we never direct companies, to let's go back and divest it all over again&mdash;the full circle. There is no doubt about you!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, the opposition clearly do not know which issue they want to follow. They are proposing a steel plan which they know nothing about and which will do nothing for the industry or for Newcastle. As I have already said, neither BHP nor the New South Wales government believe that government intervention could change BHP's direction. Unlike the opposition, the government is concerned about practical support for the people of Newcastle and internationally competitive policies for our industry. What every person who cares about Newcastle wants is a program which ensures a smooth transition for those wishing to relocate, reskill or retire and a program which builds upon growth and investment in the Hunter region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP have a comprehensive program in place to deal with the announcement. The government will be working with the company when necessary to ensure that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefits of that program are maximised. This decision by BHP was becoming a possibility as far back as 1995.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a disgraceful performance. Let me correct the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). Let me tell you a few facts. You just said, as did the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) earlier, that at the end of 1982 BHP employed 54,000 people. Let me tell you, by May 1983 they employed 25,000 people. The works at Newcastle had dropped from almost 12,000 in 1981 when John Howard was Treasurer to 6,500 by May 1983. The cabinet meeting that has been spoken about earlier was the one when BHP announced the retrenchment of 5,000 people in mid&hyphen;1982. John Howard was Treasurer, but where was he? He was the same place he has been these last few weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, concerning the Button plan being a failure, let me tell the minister one part of the plan which he did not mention: the money to help diversify the steel regions totalled $100 million, of which $45 million in cash was given to the Newcastle&hyphen;Hunter community to diversify, to get new industries and to broaden the economic base. Money went into TAFE, into improved training, into a whole range of activities which is why our economy is now much stronger&mdash;$45 million in 1983 dollars. We are supposed to be grateful now that the Prime Minister is going to lob up there with some lolly jar of $10 million in 1997 dollars&mdash;$45 million in 1983 dollars compared to $10 million now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those so&hyphen;called federalists opposite, is he doing it in conjunction with the states as we did in 1983?

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3370"> announce, as and when he sees fit, what particular bits he will give and to where.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are about to see the most blatant bit of pork barrelling. Mind you, the barrel is tiny. You could not call it pork; it is more like a tiny bit of bacon. That is the kind of nonsense we are getting from those opposite.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FI4">Mr ALLAN MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is the bacon&mdash;the bit of rind that is left. We have known for some decades that the blast furnaces at Newcastle, as at Whyalla and parts of Kembla, have limited lives. Since 1983, BHP have been considering the future of the Newcastle blast furnaces. That consideration took in a lot of opportunities and a lot of choices. At one stage, there was a strong proposal for Corex, which we were briefed on as parliamentarians in 1991. That was not proceeded with but eventually on 30 June 1995, in a quite major statement, John Prescott announced the commitment of half a billion dollars to new steel technology in Newcastle to be operational by 2002. That was to give us certainty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we saw a fortnight ago was the reversal of that decision. Back in July last year, less than a year after the 1995 announcement, BHP announced a review of their steel division and what we have seen in that last nine months or so has been a series of leaks&mdash;who knows whether they are leaks, guesses, or whatever&mdash;which have caused speculation ever since. I think most of us feel pretty cynical that that was, in fact, delivered and it was a softening up process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me talk about the problem itself first. We are not simply talking about a loss of jobs; we are talking about a 20 per cent cut to this nation's steel making capacity. We are talking about Australia being a net importer of steel by the year 2000. We currently export about 130 million tonnes of iron ore a year worth about $40 a tonne. We currently export three million tonnes of steel, earning us $1.5 billion in export earnings. By the year 2000, we will have reduced our net exports by 1.8 million tonnes of production.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 29 April, the biggest manufacturer in this country, with a capital base of $8 billion to $9 billion, said that they will be investing in that capital base at a rate below the level of depreciation, which will lead to a significant reduction of the capital base over time. They announced a reduction of 5,000 jobs across Australia. Effectively, they announced a worsening in our balance of payments of at least $1 billion. Two things happened after that: the investment market cheered and the shares went up; and the government said, `It is none of our business.' Exports will worsen by $1 billion and 5,000 jobs are to go&mdash;and it is none of their business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back to that review of mid last year. After that review was announced in budget week of August last year, as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology I raised with that committee the possibility of a parliamentary inquiry into steel to parallel BHP's review. The committee agreed to that. On 11 October last year, the chairman of the committee at the time, the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), a Liberal from Western Australia, wrote to the minister asking for a parliamentary inquiry. The minister has never answered. As far as I have been able to find, there has been no correspondence from the minister in response to that request for a parliamentary inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the minister made it clear verbally, or his staff advised the committee, that we could not have an inquiry&mdash;his members wanted it but he refused&mdash;the shadow minister, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), wrote to suggest the idea of a joint committee of parliamentarians. On 12 December, the minister wrote back saying, `I am pleased that you are agreeable to a joint committee,' but went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this in mind, I do not consider it is appropriate to task the committee with developing a plan for steel making in Australia or, indeed, to formulate specific recommendations to the Government.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a national crisis on our hands. What is happening in Newcastle is a crisis, the dimensions of which cannot be underestimated. It involves cutting 2,500 direct jobs by the year 2000 and another 2,000 people who work on the site for contractors&mdash;equivalent to 800 full-time jobs. It involves a series of downstream industries which already have been told that their jobs are going. Last week I saw letters written to people saying, `Your job will be going because BHP is a major customer.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about 8,000, 10,000 or 12,000 jobs altogether. It is a crisis for Newcastle which this government has ignored. It has fobbed it off, does not want to know about it and pretends that it had no role in it. They are in government, for God's sake! Who runs this country? One single company is deciding iron ore policy and metal and steel policy, and our balance of payments policy for the next 20 or 30 years. One single company&mdash;and it does it by press release. Two years earlier it had advised the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For 15 years, BHP has been wrong&mdash;every single year. Go back and look at every projection and every prediction: improve your performance, improve productivity and we will invest more. People have responded, accepted and trusted year after year. In 1995, despite the announced cut in jobs, we supported them because of their investment. A year later, they were wrong. They are wrong now. What they are doing now is a disaster for this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former President of the United States Thomas Jefferson once said, `I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.' I can particularly relate that to the statements made by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the diatribe and carrying on in his speech, where, in particular, he said nothing about what he would do about the problem. Another steel plan? I remind people that absolutely no financial assistance from that steel plan came to Newcastle&mdash;no dollars at all. All they delivered was rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The steel plan applied bounties to five different products, only one of which was made in Newcastle. But, over the life of that plan, not one cent was paid to Newcastle for the manufacture of that product. By far the bulk of the money went to Port Kembla and Western Port. Perhaps it was because of the quality of the representation of the people in those areas that they got more for their areas than we got in the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important, though, that we look at what BHP has done. We notice that the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) has not been on his feet screaming about the industry decision, nor has the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). Why? Because they have benefited from BHP's decision to relocate the steel making facility that came out of Newcastle in their electorates.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How vocal was the member for Newcastle in this period? We heard absolutely nothing from him.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Moore) attending tourism functions such as the opening of the casino is the fact that he probably was not invited&mdash;and so he has decided to play out in the media the fact that, because they have delivered nothing for Victoria, he was not invited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need to consider is that now is the time to go ahead in the Hunter. I have had a lot of phone calls to my office from people who have said, `Thank God BHP has finally made the decision.' When we talk about the 1995 release by BHP committing it to an electric arc furnace, the point that seems to be ignored here&mdash;the consideration that nobody raises when they keep expounding this&mdash;is that, if an electric arc furnace had gone in, there would have been downsizing in the company because the number of people required to operate that would have been a lot smaller than the number of people required to operate the fully integrated steel making facility. But do they raise that? No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there was a genuine commitment by BHP in 1995 and if the member for Hotham and his team were so hot to trot and able to deliver, why did they not get contracts signed? Why were the contracts not in place then, so that they could not back out? The bottom line is, BHP has made a commercial decision.

BHP have said that their export product was around 42 per cent of their volume. Because of global economic demands, that has been downsized to around 37 per cent. But, as I said, the steel making is going to areas such as Port Kembla and Whyalla. We have heard nothing about the people there. We have not heard them get up and scream, `BHP, take it away from us and give it back to Newcastle.' No, not at all.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LL6">Mr BOB BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you that the people of Whyalla have refused to go on strike. Why? Because they have got a direct benefit. Quite simply, BHP at Newcastle is going to expand slightly. They are going to concentrate their wire making facilities and they are also going to bring to Newcastle the rolling that was done at Geelong. That is not a lot of benefit, but at least it is something. If you listened to the member for Newcastle and the member for Hotham, you would consider that the whole of BHP was going to close in Newcastle, when it is only one facility that is going to close. Incidentally, one of the reasons they are winding back&mdash;and it is something that needs to be considered&mdash;is that they were presented with an option paper to clean up the site so that they could operate within environmental guidelines. Justifiably so, but it would cost them somewhere between $70 million and $100 million just to get going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Newcastle was quite right when he said that he sought out a steel industry inquiry. That steel industry inquiry has been supported by both Senator Tierney and me, and by other members of both the coalition and the opposition. But that steel industry inquiry has taken a long time to get to its report. In December, the report began to be put together and, as the minister has quite rightly said, he wrote to the shadow minister, the member for Hotham, asking him to nominate people. The reason the report has taken so long is, quite simply, that it took the member for Hotham nearly three months to nominate people for that committee. Why did it take so long? Because he had absolutely no faith at all in the grim reaper. Why did he have no faith in the grim reaper? Because he knew that, over the previous 13 years, he could deliver no outcomes that were successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP going out of Newcastle is sad, but there are a lot of opportunities. There are a lot of opportunities because we have things such as the advancement of Williamtown RAAF base. As the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) said in her recent visit to the Hunter&mdash;again playing down the grim reaper's attitude that the world 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was about to end and the sky was falling in&mdash;RAAF base Williamtown has the opportunity to become a super base that will employ up to 5,000 people whose income will go through the electorate. At the moment, we have around $2 million a week of spending from the incomes of that RAAF base; with the expansion, that could go up to between $4 million and $5 million per week of income spent. Then we have the British Aerospace role there, injecting a billion dollars into the aviation industry by the construction of the Hawk leading fighters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conflict is what it is always about. To sum up, this government is looking for the long&hyphen;term answers&mdash;not short&hyphen;term shooting from the hip answers&mdash;that will hatch the egg from which the phoenix will rise from the ashes. Newcastle will go ahead. The people of the Hunter will not allow the area to die. For a long time BHP has not been the major employer in the Hunter. It is ranked at about number four or number five now and, when it has made its decision to go out finally, I am sure that other players and other industries will take over that role.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there was a grammatical error in the framing of the matter of public importance. I think it should refer to `governments', not `government', because it is quite clear that this problem has not just arisen. I believe that, with the Button steel plan, the Labor Party does have a moral advantage over the coalition, because the Button steel plan was a good plan, although it was somewhat curtailed by Keating. It is simply not true, as the government claims, that no money went into Newcastle. Substantial money did go in there, albeit indirectly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems for Newcastle probably started back in the 1970s when the World Bank advanced $700 million to establish a steel industry in Korea, to which I understand Australia contributed $50 million. That was a long&hyphen;term loan at 4&half; per cent with no repayments for 10 years. It would be very nice to be giving that to our industry. BHP, the big Australian, referred to in my electorate as the `Big Hairy Poofter', is not, in my view, a good corporate citizen. Its exploration dollar 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3374"> is moving offshore at an increasing rate and performance of BHP in oil and gas is bordering on criminal. It has put lives and the environment at risk in its management of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS>, a matter on which I have put questions on notice and about which the government continues to be evasive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What could BHP have done? It would have helped, of course, if the government of the day had built the submarine at Newcastle, where it should have been built, but that would have necessitated building it from a proven British design. Instead, for largely political reasons, it was moved to Adelaide and an unproven Swedish submarine was chosen that has already cost a fortune and is, without a doubt, a lemon. The quoted price by the British to build that submarine&mdash;all six in Australia&mdash;was $3.1 billion. We signed the contract with Sweden at $4.2 billion. It has already gone through $6 billion. There is $3 billion there that could have been invested in the steel industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP could have done a lot of things on its own account though. It is clear this thing has been happening over time and that BHP has not kept up the maintenance on its plant in Newcastle. In Australia there is a need for specialised steels. A lot of people do not realise that we import just about all the specialised steel that we need. Newcastle, with its expertise in steel, could have developed these specialised steels, something which the whole economy of this country requires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last speaker, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) talked about the new job opportunities and people talk blithely about this. The trouble for a lot of people working in this industry is that it is very specialised and people have a lifetime of skills in this industry and these skills are simply not transferable. We have seen the same nonsense talked about in Tasmania where blue&hyphen;collar workers were told that their future lay in tourism. It is clear that tourism creates low paid, part&hyphen;time jobs, and jobs for women&mdash;not jobs for blue&hyphen;collar workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an enormous demand in Australia for high tensile pipe for pipelines. We import basically all that pipe at the moment. That pipe could have been built with a little fore 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sight in Newcastle, and the government would have been reprehensive, in my view, had it not supported that.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HOLLIS" NAMEID="DH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr Hollis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And we also import stainless steel.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is another case. We import a lot of stainless steel when we produce both the steel and the nickel in Australia. I believe that BHP has been very remiss in its research and development. BHP could have matched the downturn in Newcastle, if all else failed, to the growth in its Port Hedland facilities&mdash;there will be substantial growth in Hedland&mdash;but this is not to be and it will not occur. It must be understood that, in many cases, because their whole environment and their whole lives&mdash;all their assets&mdash;are involved in Newcastle, workers are not that transportable anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said that only BHP shareholders are considered, that they are the criterion in this decision. That, I believe, is not true. The shareholders of BHP have benefited enormously from the stability provided by government. There is the security of BHP's many leases provided by the government. They have received grants from the government. The shareholders of BHP, like the company, have a responsibility to this nation and to the people of this nation. I think that governments should be bringing that strongly to their attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government developed an industry policy&mdash;and this goes as much for the previous government as it goes for this government&mdash;far more steel would have been used in the economy. There would have been a greater demand for steel and BHP would then have had far less reason to close down its operations. There is no doubt that, without a manufacturing industry policy, there will be no jobs for the future in Australia and no end to the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could have seen that much bigger market for the manufacturing industry guaranteeing and underwriting the jobs for the people of Newcastle. Unless we can reassert a manufacturing industry in Australia, there simply are going to be no jobs. What I want for the future of my kids is a high wage, high skill, high education country, and we are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3375"> going backwards in all those factors. This is something that governments, today and past, have to accept responsibility for. But so does BHP. BHP has had enormous benefits from its position in Australia. It is highly regarded as the Big Australian. It is my fear that it has lost track of its responsibility&mdash;it certainly has no regard for where it came from&mdash;and I believe that the government should be jawboning it to make sure that it does recognise its responsibilities to this nation and to the people, particularly of Newcastle, who have made fortunes for the company in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is simply nonsense to say that we cannot be competitive. Of course we can be competitive with the world. In many areas we are. But if in the final analysis it boils down to wages, if we all have equal technology across the world, and we are not competitive just because of wages, then we in this country must reject that. I simply do not want my kids working for Filipino or Korean wages. It is not the future I want for my kids, and nor should it be the future envisaged for the children of Australia by any government of any persuasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say once more: it is a case of the failure of governments, not just this government, although this government is the government today and has the responsibility now. From what the government has said so far, it seems very clear to me that the government has no intention to do anything about re-establishing a manufacturing industry. It will be very interesting to read in the budget tonight whether that is the case. I suspect we are going to see further contractions in R&amp;D and, therefore, further lead in the saddle of manufacturing in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1897 and 1898, Australians from all the colonies, except Queensland, gathered in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne to hold a constitutional convention that led Australia down the historic path to Federation. The founding fathers did so in a spirit which, despite the many divisions that existed in their respective home colonies, had at its core the belief that they were involved in the task of nation building, of shaping the form that a new Australian federation would take. It was a task they took on regardless of their personal views as to whether the Australian colonies should take the final step towards nationhood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A century later, this government has no such vision, no such spirit. It has designed a process for constitutional reform based on fear. It is a process that is designed to pull Australians apart, not one which is designed to bring them together. It is a process that will entrench division rather than promote the consensus the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claims he wants. Rather than embrace and consider change in an open and constructive way, this government and, in particular, this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3377"> Prime Minister have been dragged to adopting a process for constitutional reform that is and has been all about avoiding the very reform that is sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a process designed to alienate Australians from both the process and the outcome. It is designed to minimise their involvement so that this government can disregard and discredit the genuine desire that Australians have to resolve this issue. It seeks to take from the hands of ordinary Australians the decision they most want to make themselves&mdash;that is, whether we as Australians have a right to aspire to the highest office in the land, whether we want to become a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no denying that the people's convention is not the Labor Party's preferred means for achieving the republic. We believe that the best way to do this is to put the decision straight into the hands of the Australian people through an indicative plebiscite and, ultimately, via a referendum. Realistically, however, the people's convention is the only option that we who unequivocally support the republic have if Australia is to make the change that we believe is both important and inevitable. That is why the Labor Party supports the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill and supports the people's convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But our support is not unconditional. We will be seeking to make changes to this bill both here and in the Senate which will make the convention fairer, more democratic and reflective of community opinion. They are changes that the government will ignore at its peril for we will not take part in a process that is ultimately designed to destroy the very idea we strive for. If the decision Australians make whether to become a republic or not is to be judged as fair dinkum, it is critical that the process to get us there is fair dinkum too. That is where our concerns about this bill begin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to look at recent political history to see why this bill is before us in its present form. What has brought it here? Why is it our last best hope? It is no secret that in 1994 the then Leader of the Opposition, the now Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was in a pickle. The coalition looked like losing the next federal election, and one of the factors creating doubt in the electorate's mind was the inability of the coalition to resolve its internal squabbling over the republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the current Prime Minister, a renowned monarchist, inherited the leadership, the idea of a people's convention served him well as a means to neutralise the politically damaging issue the republic had become. But he did not embrace the idea of a people's convention because he wanted to embrace the discussion of constitutional reform. No, once again, it was a means of avoiding the destructive, internal party infighting and the damaging political effect of this issue both to him personally and to the coalition as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, the whole idea of a people's convention has been poisoned since its inception. It has been contrived in fear and timidity, not in hope and vision. Rather than a means for considered deliberation of constitutional reform, it has always been a means for the coalition to avoid making a decision on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When earlier this year the Prime Minister decided to push ahead with the convention&mdash;to keep his election commitment&mdash;it was once again not because he was prepared to consider change but rather because he feared what would happen if he was seen to be resisting that change. It is fear that has motivated the government's policy on this issue from the beginning. Unlike the founding fathers a century ago, who embraced the processes of change that led the nation to Federation, this Prime Minister fears change. He refuses to lead. This bill is weak and sneaky. It reeks of the Prime Minister's fear of tackling the republic head-on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is nowhere more evident than in the Prime Minister's second reading speech. In a speech where he could have outlined his clear vision for Australia's future, our destiny, our place in the world, what did he do? What does he always do when the issue is big? He equivocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only in two paragraphs of his speech&mdash;the first and the last&mdash;did he describe the nature of the choice to be put before the people's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3378"> convention and, even then, only in a formal way. He devoted three paragraphs to discuss the reluctance of both him and his government to change our constitutional framework. In the remaining 18 paragraphs&mdash;yes, 18 paragraphs; 78 per cent of his speech for the statisticians amongst you&mdash;he described in mind&hyphen;numbing detail such amazing relevancies as whether the ballot papers would be bar&hyphen;coded, the size of the ballot paper and whether appeal processes under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 would apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the extent of the leadership and vision of our Prime Minister. No-one expected the Gettysburg Address, least of all from this Prime Minister, but the Australian people both expected and deserved something better than this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This lack of leadership and vision manifests itself in every clause of this bill. The whole thing is designed to leave the government with a way out&mdash;regardless of the result of the ballot to elect delegates to the convention, regardless of the result of the convention's deliberations, regardless of the will of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How? Firstly, because the bill is undemocratic. It is a dangerous experiment in voluntary voting which seeks to disempower millions of ordinary Australians by ensuring that as few of them as possible express their view on this important issue. Secondly, because the government sought to defy convention. It has sought to rig the appointed delegates to the convention, especially the parliamentary delegates, to favour the coalition. In doing so, it seeks to prevent consensus&mdash;the test the Prime Minister himself has laid down for determining the convention's success. Finally, because the government has failed to set up a framework through which the convention can undertake its deliberation on the issue of the republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party could just walk away from this weak and sneaky bill. We could throw up our hands and forget all about our desire to see Australia become a republic. But we cannot. This ideal is too important to us and to all those who believe in the republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, we will move to amend this bill to make it both workable and fair. We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will give the Australian people every opportunity to send a loud and clear message to the Prime Minister that, if he is not going to lead on this issue, then he should get out of their way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will do this by moving amendments that empower ordinary Australians. That will help them to express their opinion on this issue. That will make the process fair. We will treat this convention with the seriousness that it deserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the voluntary postal ballot, the first indication of the government's contempt for the Australian people over this issue is its decision to have a voluntary postal ballot to elect delegates to the convention. If a voluntary postal ballot is held, it will be the first time a Commonwealth election, plebiscite or referendum will have been determined by this means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims to support this approach because of the cost. The government is currently arguing that a voluntary postal ballot will cost approximately $40 million, compared with $49 million for a compulsory attendance ballot. This cost differential is still the subject of considerable dispute, with the final cost of a compulsory attendance ballot likely to be considerably less than the amount claimed and the cost of a voluntary voting ballot likely to be considerably more. In any case, the cost of democracy has never been an issue and should not be one now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also argued that Australians should not be compelled to vote at a ballot for a convention that is not binding. Yet the convention will be binding to the extent that its recommendations will form the model of the republic that will ultimately be put to the people at a referendum. Furthermore, voluntary postal voting sits uncomfortably with the Prime Minister's commitment to consult all Australians at the beginning, the middle and the end of the process. How can we truly describe this as the people's convention unless all Australians have participated in the process?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under a voluntary postal ballot not all Australians will. The Australian Electoral Commission has admitted that up to two million Australians change their address each 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3379"> year. Since this ballot will be held 18 months from the last federal election, up to three million people may not receive a ballot paper simply because they have not notified the commission of their change of address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, material about the ballot will only be available in writing and in English. This is likely to disenfranchise many of those Australians who are blind, the frail aged, the illiterate or those whose English language skills are not of a sufficiently high standard. `For all of us' has become `for some of us'&mdash;white Anglo&hyphen;Saxon Protestants. Most of these persons are currently assisted through their attendance at polling booths or the use of mobile polling booths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A postal ballot will also not be distributed to approximately 200,000 Australians who are likely to be overseas at the time of the ballot. Many of those Australians would otherwise vote at an overseas polling booth. A voluntary vote is also likely to be used by those within the government, such as Senator Minchin, to support their ultimate desire to see voluntary voting introduced at federal elections. Recent opinion polls show that 72 per cent of Australians support compulsory voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of voluntary voting postal ballots in this country, which have only been used for local council and trade union elections, is not good. Recent experience in both Victoria and South Australia is testament to that. At best, the experience of voluntary postal ballots shows that only 60 to 70 per cent of Australians are likely to vote. The more usual figure is a 30 to 40 per cent turnout. This will be used by some to discredit any message sent by the electorate through its preference for pro-republican or monarchist  candidates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, if the opinion polls are right and 60 per cent of those 60 per cent of Australians who do vote, vote for pro-republican candidates, then the monarchists will be able to claim, as I predict they will, that only 36 per cent of the total Australian population supports the republic. On this basis, they will go on to adduce that there is no clear consensus in favour of a republic. An example of this behaviour has already been demonstrated by the member for Warringah 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (Mr Abbott), a monarchist, who stated in the most recent addition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adelaide Review</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if republican candidates win two-thirds of the vote in the election for delegates . . . that still leaves the Convention `do you want a Republic?' vote at about 88 to 64 which is hardly a consensus or even a particularly overwhelming majority for change.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In a government that is willing to claim a consensus in the Senate for major changes that affect the lives of citizens every day on the back of one vote, such a view of consensus rings very hollow. However, the very dynamic of a voluntary ballot is flawed. It encourages political opponents to spend time drumming up support amongst their own supporters rather than amongst the general community&mdash;particularly those who are yet to make up their minds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Prime Minister is serious about building a consensus across the Australian people either for or against the republic, then it is these middle of the road swinging voters who must be convinced to vote one way or the other. It is this very dynamic that is at work in our compulsory parliamentary elections. It is what determines who wins and loses government. If it is good enough to decide such transitory yet important issues as that, then why does the government not believe that a decision about the future of our constitutional arrangements is just as important?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple reason is that they do not. From the first day the republic became an important issue in Australian politics, the coalition and this Prime Minister have sought to deny its importance, to pretend it is not there. But just like certain other issues of moment, it just will not go away. Until this government and this Prime Minister are willing to show leadership on this issue, they will be plagued by their inability to express a vision of our future which is consonant with the desires of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Undoubtedly, some opposite will claim that the only reason the Labor Party opposes voluntary voting is our fear of the practical political consequences. In this case, that is simply not true. The opinion polls on the republic have consistently shown that if a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3380"> voluntary ballot were to be held more republicans would vote and therefore more republicans would win than if a compulsory attendance ballot were held.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our position is, as it has always been, principled&mdash;and it is a position that is in accord with the wishes of the Australian people. Accordingly, the Labor Party will be moving amendments to this bill both here and in the Senate to require the holding of a compulsory attendance ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the voting system adopted by the government for the ballot. The government has adopted a Senate style voting system which will have both above and below the line voting. However, in a number of respects, the ballot paper will be quite different from that which is ordinarily used at Senate elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, group candidates will only be represented on the ballot paper by the name of the first candidate in the group and a short name requested by the group. The names of the remainder of the candidates within that group will not appear on the ballot paper at all. Instead, voters will have to refer to an accompanying booklet and their names cross&hyphen;referenced to a number on the ballot paper that will have to be numbered if a voter wishes to vote below the line. Admittedly, based on past experience in the Senate, 95 per cent of Australians will not choose to vote below the line. However, to feather the democratic right of ordinary Australians through this mechanism is just ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its second submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill, the Australian Electoral Commission tried to argue that this method of voting should not prove too difficult for too many Australians. They said of the process:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This process is in fact quite similar to that pursued across Australia every week, without difficulty, by thousands of punters, who use a form guide to determine the number of the horses etc. on which they want to bet, and who thereafter transcribe those numbers onto betting slips.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whilst I would not want to deny the seriousness with which many Australians place their bets, the suggestion that an election for a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> convention to discuss serious constitutional issues should be likened to a bet on the Dapto dogs is insulting. It also ignores the very real difficulty that many thousands of ordinary Australians have when they go down to the TAB for their one big bet of the year on Melbourne Cup day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes such as those described above have been introduced only to confuse voters and to make it more difficult for them to properly record their preferences for candidates either at this election of delegates for the people's convention or the next time they vote for the Senate. To ensure that as many Australians as possible vote in the manner they choose, we should be adopting the voting system with which Australians are most familiar. The Senate ballot system provides the perfect model. The government will no doubt argue that a Senate style ballot paper is more expensive. Well, I hate to tell the government this, but democracy costs money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want Australians to cast the best, most informed vote they can, then you should adopt the system that we are all most familiar with. Anything less is only likely to lead to confusion and uncertainty in the minds of voters. Some voters will give up in frustration and others will cast ballots that do not have the effect they intend. In both cases the democratic will of the people is undermined and that, surely, is in no&hyphen;one's interest&mdash;or is it? It is because we want every Australian's vote to count&mdash;no matter whom they vote for&mdash;that the Labor Party will move amendments to regularise the voting system to accord with that used for the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to appointed delegates, the bill does not deal with the appointment of delegates to the people's convention. Despite the fact that they will make up half the convention and thus will be highly influential in its deliberations, we only have the Prime Minister's word that appointments will occur in the manner which he described in his second reading speech. If Australians are going to put their decision about the form a republic should take into the hands of the convention, then they are entitled to know who will be appointed to the convention and that those appointed will be fairly chosen.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3381">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has announced that there will be 76 appointed delegates to the convention, 40 of whom will be drawn from parliamentary representatives, and the remaining 36 from the general community. Of the 40 parliamentary delegates, 20 will be drawn from the Commonwealth parliament, with each state sending three representatives and the territories sending one each. In the case of the federal parliament, the government has indicated that it intends to have 12 delegates drawn from the coalition, six from the Labor Party, one from the Australian Democrats and one drawn at random from amongst the Independents and minor parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the state parliaments, the government will appoint the relevant state Premier, the relevant Leader of the Opposition and one additional person nominated by the relevant Premier. In the case of the territories, only the Chief Minister will attend. This position unduly advantages government parties and, as a result of the current political make&hyphen;up of the Australian parliaments, the coalition. In total, this method will deliver 25 coalition delegates, 13 from the Labor Party and two members from minor parties or the Independents. This position breaches the precedent established in the previous constitutional convention held from 1973 to 1985 under the auspices of both the federal Labor and coalition governments. That convention saw equal representation from all parliamentary delegations of government and non&hyphen;government members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That precedent recognised that the discussion of constitutional reform should not be beholden to the transitory fortunes of political parties. In the particular case of the ACT, I also note that the Liberal Chief Minister, Mrs Kate Carnell, has been critical of the government's failure to allow Labor's Leader of the Opposition, Mr Whitecross, to be represented at the convention. Our amendments will rectify this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why the grab for votes? Once again, it is because the coalition wants to control the agenda of the convention. It is not interested in cross&hyphen;party consensus; rather, it is interested in ensuring that pro&hyphen;monarchist forces within the coalition are overrepresented in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comparison with support for the republic amongst the general community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, Labor will be moving amendments to the bill to provide for fair representation at the convention as follows: from the federal parliament there will be 16 representatives, with eight to be appointed by the Prime Minister, six to be appointed by the Leader of the Opposition, one to be appointed by the Leader of the Australian Democrats and one to be drawn at random from amongst the remaining members and senators; from the state parliaments two representatives will be appointed by respective premiers and two will be appointed by the respective leaders of the opposition; and from the territory parliaments the representatives will be the respective chief ministers and leaders of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As this measure would otherwise decrease the level of community representation at the convention&mdash;and that is not the Labor Party's desire&mdash;we will also move an amendment to increase the number of appointed delegates to 80. This will ensure that there are still 36 delegates appointed from the wider community. Naturally, this will result in an increase in the number of elected delegates to ensure that half the delegates are elected and half are appointed. Accordingly, we propose that the number of elected representatives per state be divided as follows: New South Wales, 22; Victoria, 17; Queensland, 14; Western Australia, nine; South Australia, eight; Tasmania, six; Australian Capital Territory, two; and the Northern Territory, two&mdash;a total of 80.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state by state breakdown of these elected delegates has been calculated using the same formula applied by the government. However, the Labor Party is willing to negotiate with the government on the final mix. The community representatives to the convention are currently to be appointed by the government. The fact that the government failed to notify the community that they could self&hyphen;nominate to be considered for appointment only confirms widespread concern that the government may stack the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To remove these fears, the Labor Party will be moving amendments to ensure the appointment process is handed over to a joint select committee of the parliament, made up of an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3382"> equal number of government and non&hyphen;government members who will approve by a two&hyphen;thirds majority the persons to be appointed as community representatives to the convention. The joint select committee will also be commissioned to draw up preliminary rules and procedures for the convention, although these rules will be capable of amendment by the convention once it begins sitting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the issue of an independent chair. Labor believes that the convention process will be assisted by the appointment of an independent non-voting chair. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has already written to the Prime Minister making this suggestion and advancing Sir Anthony Mason, former Chief Justice of the High Court, as a possible nominee. Sir Anthony is an outstanding Australian whose long service on the bench has done enormous credit both to him and to the nation. He has consistently demonstrated himself to be fair in his dealings with all sides of politics, and his candidacy should have no problem drawing support from all sides of politics. Naturally, the appointment of the independent chair would need to be confirmed by the joint parliamentary committee. The creation of this position is reflected in Labor's amendments to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite its many and glaring faults, this bill and the convention can be salvaged. Labor's amendments will ensure that all Australians get a genuine say in the process of constitutional reform, that the convention is genuinely representative of the diverse views of our people and that it is run in a fair and open manner. Unlike its predecessors a century ago, this convention will reflect the great variety and diversity of the peoples of our nation. Women, young Australians, people from non-English backgrounds and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders will all have the opportunity to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The convention provides our nation with an opportunity to embrace the consideration of change and to welcome the challenge it presents. Let us stop fearing what change may bring. Give us a genuine opportunity for Australians from right across our country and from all walks of life to discuss both fairly and openly a change that is fundamental to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> our sense of national identity. Only then will Australians feel that they have a system of government that truly represents them in terms of their history, the reality of their daily lives and their vision for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that we ask is that Australians be given a fair and reasonable opportunity to decide. We in the Labor Party are confident that, given the opportunity, Australians will choose to become a republic. We are prepared to offer Australians that choice, confident in our own sense of Australia's past, present and future. We cannot go back. We should not go back. This is not the 1890s; this is the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are about to celebrate the centenary of Federation&mdash;the centenary of our nation. We are about to commence a new millennium. This is an opportunity that is too good to be missed, too good to be sullied and too good to be given up by a mean-spirited Prime Minister who wallows in the past and who is reflective of the past. He is in a position where he said that he would govern for all Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to discuss the importance to the people of Australia of the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997. The concept of a people's convention is not new to Australia. During the 1890s three conventions were held. It was at the first of these conventions&mdash;the National Australasian Convention in 1891&mdash;that our constitution was drafted. At the Bathurst People's Federal Convention in 1896 the draft of our constitution was reviewed. From 1897 to 1898 the Australasian Federal Convention was convened, and it was here that the concept for an Australian federation was resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our most recent constitutional convention was held over a number of years from 1973 to 1985. This convention identified areas of the constitution requiring change and referred these areas to standing committees for investigation and report. Four recommended changes were put to a referendum in 1977 and three of these changes were passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The constitutional convention in this bill is of vital importance to the future direction of Australia. This convention is the first real 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3383"> meeting that truly represents the men and women of Australia. It will not be a forum in which to litmus test community support for any particular political agenda. Instead, it will be a forum for Australians, elected by Australians, whose task it will be to begin the final steps in our evolution as an independent nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Integral to this independence is the question of whether or not the British monarch should be removed as Australia's head of state. The very existence of an unelected head of state whose title is hereditary is complete anathema to the Australian concept of a fair go for everyone. Presently our Governor-General may be appointed on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. But he or she still represents the British monarch. As Professor P.H. Lane rightly points out, `The monarch is only a shadow over a de facto republic. The Governor-General is a de facto president appointed by an elected Prime Minister and answerable to this Prime Minister, almost invariably acting on his advice.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the inescapable fact is that our head of state remains the Queen of England and her successors, irrespective of the limited nature of her influence in Australia. This very fact, in my opinion, is an affront to the fundamental concepts of liberalism. No-one deserves the right to be my&mdash;indeed, Australia's&mdash;sovereign by virtue of birthright alone. Essentially, the concept of hereditary title is incongruous with Australian beliefs that it is possible that any Australian can one day lead this country, whatever his or her background may be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian constitution of today, when all relevant High Court interpretations are taken into account, is almost unrecognisable from its first draft. However, proponents of the constitution often recite in its defence the phrase `if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. Apart from being a trite mantra that supports mediocrity, this seriously misrepresents the true status of our constitution. It is a piece of British legislation that is more suited to the 1890s. It is antiquated and parts of it are unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence of this fact can be drawn from the number of cases dealing with constitutional 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issues before the High Court. Since 1903, a period covering just under 100 years, there have been 1,019 cases before the court dealing with an interpretation of the constitution. Contrast this with the fact that since 1790, which is a period of some 200 years, there have been 853 cases where constitutional matters have been considered before the US Supreme Court and, unlike that court, our High Court cases are not decisions related to what could be called the `teething years' in the history of the constitution. In fact, the High Court is still required to gauge the intent of our founding fathers on matters of fundamental national importance such as taxation and external affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of cases heard in the High Court dealing with constitutional issues serves to illustrate the fact that our constitution is not a living document. This is supported by the fact that the High Court has had to introduce a broad construction of the constitution in order to make it applicable to changes that have concerned Australia. Ultimately, the judges of the High Court have sought to expand constitutional powers by simply divining the intent of our founding fathers. These are the same founding fathers who, when drafting the constitution, would have had no concept of international human rights, Aboriginal reconciliation, ecologically sustainable development and other issues, including the importance of telecommunications for the future of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that the Statute of Westminster 1931 and the Australia Act 1986 have transformed the constitutional relationship between Britain and Australia. This severing of legal ties with Britain not only gave Australia the impetus to seek a new sphere of influence in Asia but also paved the way for a divergence between Australian and British laws. Under British law, our head of state in Australia cannot succeed if he or she is any religion other than Protestant. In addition, males enjoy succession in preference to females. Both of these concepts are at odds with the Australian laws protecting equal opportunity and ironically section 116 of the constitution, which states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3384">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office . . . under the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">More importantly, they are at odds with the spirit, diversity and fundamental beliefs of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some might argue that it is merely a matter of modernising the constitution to reflect the changes that have taken place in Australia since its inception rather than changing our head of state. But to effect this revamp would be tantamount to a rewrite. Indeed, to use the constitution as it stands today as the basis for a minimalist republican constitution would require over 70 changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One area where constitutional change may be required is in relation to the reserve powers. The reserve powers held by the Governor&hyphen;General are uncodified and therefore discretionary, and convention dictates that they should be exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister. However, the potential exists for these powers to be exercised contrary to this advice, as occurred in 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of republican constitutions, such as that of the Irish Free State in 1922, have codified the reserve powers. It is therefore preposterous to argue that keeping these reserve powers unwritten and subject to only the dictates of convention will ensure that the constitution remains fluid. These unwritten laws are too rarely used to support this argument. Perhaps the most cogent argument for ensuring that these laws are written down is that it then becomes possible for judicial review of actions to take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are usually four arguments propounded in support of reserve powers, each as insupportable as the next. Firstly, it is argued that reserve powers are required to deal with a government which acts illegally. Apart from the existing judicial review procedures, a republican head could be given the authority to deal with such a government should the illegality go too far and, should the republican head act illegally, he or she could be impeached according to a written code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the situation might arise where no party has the majority in the House of Representatives, resulting in a voting deadlock. There are obviously only two ways to deal with this situation; namely, political accom 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> modation, where a matter is resolved through negotiation or mediation to remove the deadlock or, failing this, by dissolving the parliament and calling a general election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, parliament may be acting unconstitutionally. In Ireland, if the President is convinced that a bill is unconstitutional, after consultation with the Council of State the bill can be sent to the Supreme Court for a constitutional test. If the court decides that the bill is constitutional, the President can sign it. This procedure could in fact make extensive and costly constitutional litigation in our own High Court a thing of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, what constitutional options are available when the Senate is blocking supply? The founding fathers did anticipate a situation where a contradiction might exist between the Senate and the House of Representatives and allowed for a joint sitting of the parliament. Only once, in 1975, has the opposition used its majority in the Senate to force a government out of office. We have seen many instances where the opposition parties control the Senate, but there has never been the corresponding demand for a role in government formation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution lies in an amendment to the constitution to say that the government must have the confidence of the House of Representatives and that the Senate must not use its power to overthrow the government by blocking supply required for, in the words of Alan J. Ward, `the ordinary annual services of government'. With the exception of Italy, this standard is the minimum standard recognised in every bicameral parliamentary system in the Western world. I find it patronising and a little insulting to think that lurking in the shadows and corridors of parliament are these unqualified, unwritten powers which can be swung into action by a person elected by no-one to reprimand the popularly elected Australian representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further argument used against constitutional change is that it will lead to political instability. Our current head of state is not the source of our nation's political stability. This stability is derived from the inherent political culture of our nation, and this is a culture which has embraced the tenets of modern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3385"> liberalism, specifically the recognition of the inalienable rights of the individual, a belief in parliamentary democracy, a commitment to improve our society through reform, and the equality of opportunity for all our citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has often been said that a republic in Australia is inevitable. This may be so, but a republic will not come on its own. It requires impetus and it requires discussion in every quarter of our land. This bill before the House today is the first step in deciding whether or not Australia should become a republic. The constitutional convention itself will be an important opportunity for reaching broad agreement on suitable changes to the Australian constitution which may be acceptable to the Australian people at a subsequent referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opposition to the constitutional convention has centred on its supposed superfluous nature. Critics have demanded a plebiscite on the singular issue of whether or not Australia should become a republic. This simple approach perhaps overlooks the inherent scepticism of Australians to wholesale change, as evidenced by the reluctance of the Australian people to permit change to the constitution. In fact only eight from 42 proposals for reform of the constitution have been accepted by Australians since 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The make&hyphen;up of the convention is also relevant. Half of the delegates will be appointed and half of the delegates will be elected and 10 per cent of the convention will be made up of young Australians aged between 18 and 25. These citizens will assist in the drafting of questions to be put to the Australian people, hopefully in a later referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This convention will serve to promote discussion in the community about the future constitutional direction of our nation. Half of the delegates will be chosen as representatives from the varied make&hyphen;up of the Australian community. The other half will be appointed by the government and will include parliamentarians, community leaders and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Voting of course is not compulsory in this election. However, interest in a republic is already aroused and the convention will open up the discussion in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the wider community and will lead ultimately to the question of whether Australia does or does not become a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the first conventions at the end of the last century which led to our Federation, Sir Henry Parkes had great difficulty in encouraging the states to come to the table and to talk about the future. The states were preoccupied with dealing with the Great Depression of the 1890s. It was only as the effects of the depression began to wane that the states decided to turn their attention to a possible federation. One hundred years later&mdash;and ironically the circumstances are not so different&mdash;the issue of a republic is at the forefront of constitutional debate across the country&mdash;in parliaments, in the media and in the homes of many Australians. We therefore once again have the opportunity as a nation to shape our constitutional future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue is not about attacking existing structures. Our current system of government essentially works well. This is more about changing the symbols of our nation. An Australian republic should not be construed as an attack on Her Majesty the Queen. In fact I think there is great merit in her retaining the title of Queen of Australia for the rest of her life only, notwithstanding that Australia may have become a republic. This debate is about changing our current head of state from a respected person who is the ruling monarch of a distant land to an Australian&mdash;one of us, a leader from our own land.</PARA></SPEECH>

Labor's plan, as unveiled by the former Prime Minister, was to offer the people of Australia a direct choice on the matter, right at the beginning of the whole decision making process. A national plebiscite was to be held which asked one question, `Do you want an Australian head of state?' If the answer came back with a majority yes vote, then the number of proposals for adjusting the constitution would then be discussed, decided upon and then put to the people in a referendum as a final step towards becoming a republic&mdash;very simple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's plan, which we have now seen unfold over the last year and a half, is a decidedly more complex, more cumbersome and less democratic arrangement. It is an arrangement&mdash;conceived out of political desperation, born of political opportunism&mdash;which is seriously and fundamentally flawed. The people's convention of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was dreamt up by the current Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) when he was opposition leader in an attempt to bridge the deep divisions which exist in the coalition over the republic. Their plan was never designed solely for providing Australians with the most coherent framework possible to begin the decision making process surrounding the republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the current leader of the coalition, the Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, the people's convention holds other attractions, more personal attractions. He sees it as an opportunity to embroil the whole issue in political controversy and animosity. He hopes that, if it degenerates into a political squabble, the convention will give the appearance of division in the community on the republic and create among ordinary Australians a level of distaste for the whole debate. For the Prime Minister, such distaste and frustration is just one step away from a vote rejecting a republic in any future referendum; yet flawed as the plan may be, devious as it may be, it is what we are left with at this moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although we will not be standing in the way of the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill, we will seek to amend it. Despite 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the inevitability of the bill's passage&mdash;we can all count in this House&mdash;we cannot stand and watch its serious failings pass without a fight. We will not let that happen, for one important reason. While this bill's passage may be guaranteed, the processes which it seeks to set into motion, the debate that it seeks to promote, the direction that it seeks to provide for the nation in the future are not so safely assured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a real danger that the failings of the convention which this bill seeks to set in place will taint&mdash;even cripple&mdash;the credibility of the entire republic decision making process. For this to happen would be a great tragedy. Australia's future identity depends on this process being as straightforward and as politically unbiased and untainted as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, this is so far not what the Australian people are getting. It is not a case of those on this side of the House simply pushing the republican barrow, crying sour grapes and complaining, `The government has organised things to stymie the republican push.' It is a matter of arguing, `The government has organised things so badly, so incoherently, for its own selfish reasons, that the Australian people will not be provided with the clearest and most transparent framework possible in which to debate these issues and to make up their minds.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During this whole process, the members of the coalition, including the Prime Minister, have repeatedly made the point that their people's convention carried on the same traditions of the federation conventions of the 1890s. It is a spurious argument and it needs to be exposed for that. For a start, the conventions of 1890s were made up of individuals united by a common purpose. Despite their differences of opinion and politics, they were all proponents of the one cause: Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's convention, peppered as it will be with republicans and constitutional monarchists alike, will enjoy none of this unity of purpose. Let me quote Helen Irving, the Australian author recognised nationally for her expertise in Federation history. Ms Irving said of the conventions organised in the 1890s: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3387">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the distinctive things about this convention which . . . makes it different from the model that John Howard has in mind, is that people went there, the delegates went there, committed to the principle of Federation. They went looking for a way to bring about a nation that was based on a federal principle.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Will these people participating in the Prime Minister's convention all be proponents of a republic and concerned only with the best means of achieving this aim? Of course they will not. We talk about the fathers of our constitution having the powers to compromise and agree on a set of very difficult questions. They were able to compromise because they knew that, despite their differences, they had a common goal in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I defy anyone to tell me that we are going to see the Lloyd Waddys and the Malcolm Turnbulls of this world jumping into bed in a spirit of compromise engendered by the convention. It just will not happen.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the type of people we are going to have sit around here in Canberra. Will these people arrive at the convention seeking a common path for the good of Australia? Not likely. Of course, if the Australian people had been offered a national plebiscite on an Australian head of state before any convention took place, it would be quite a different story. If the Australian people had been offered a national plebiscite on an Australian head of state and a yes vote had eventuated, those attending the convention would be doing so having been given a clear direction by the Australian people on which to base their discussions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the Prime Minister's convention is not like the federation conventions of the previous century in this respect. It differs in other ways as well. The conventions of the 1890s carried authority. They were initiating bodies. The decisions they made, the proposals they put forward, were the final propositions to be put to the Australian people. We had no constitution then. We had no parliament federally and there was no Commonwealth. We now have a constitution. We now have a parliament federally. Our federal parliament is the only initiating body which covers the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's convention cannot determine the questions to be put to the people in a referendum. Under our constitution, this is the responsibility of this parliament, so any convention held today can only exist in an advisory capacity. It provides advice to the Prime Minister, advice which he can tamper with, bend or just simply reject and throw out of hand. This is an important point and people have to be told that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federation conventions of the 1890s were not like the Prime Minister's convention: simply an exercise in social debate. They were so much more than that. The Prime Minister's convention is nothing more than a pale and shrivelled imitation of the original convention. He knows it and so do his government members. Seen without the initiating powers of the federation conventions, seen from the fact that its participants will not be attending united by a common goal, it begins to look alarmingly like the Prime Minister is extremely happy to spend $40 million of the taxpayers' money on 152 people arguing with each other here in the Commonwealth for 10 days. The people of Australia think it is ridiculous to the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a well-known fact that the majority of Australians do not rank the republic as the No. 1 issue facing this country at this very moment. But it would be wrong to say that the same majority do not have a view on it. Not only do they have a view but also they are ready to express that view in the ballot box. Australians have been talking about a republic for the last 20 years and with even greater interest over the last five or six. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3388"> majority of them already know where they stand on the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even for those who have not considered the question in any great detail, do those in favour of a convention seriously believe that the amount of debate generated by having an indicative plebiscite on an Australian head of state would not crystallise the matter for them? Australians see the people's convention not only as a gigantic waste of money but also as an unnecessary irritant. They are deeply cynical about politicians and the intellectual elite gasbagging at the best of times, but watching $40 million of their money being frittered away on a spectacle of 152 men and women banging their heads together in Old Parliament House will be for them a source of complete and utter frustration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians expect to be consulted on whether they want a republic and, if so, the constitutional changes required to best bring it about. But the majority of Australians also feel they have already chosen their representatives to draw up the changes to the constitution on which they are to vote, should they decide they want an Australian as their head of state, and those representatives&mdash;148 of them, here in this parliament&mdash;were decided at the last ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, there are 148 of us&mdash;76 in the other place&mdash;and we are all very well paid for our trouble. Why do we need to spend $40 million of the Australian taxpayers' money on giving 152 people the privilege of supplanting us and this institution? This is what the Australian people are saying and I, for one, agree wholeheartedly with them. It is also a view shared by many distinguished Australians from both sides of the political divide. What did that very distinguished former Governor-General Sir Zelman Cowen have to say about the issue of the people's convention? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't really understand why we want pre&hyphen;federation conventions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've got books full of proposals that have come from . . . constitutional conventions, constitutional commissions or the like, which have considered 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> change to our Constitution, and those books are virtually mouldering.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And what about this on the convention:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that if you do it that way you're going to make it very difficult to make progress.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And, heaven forbid, Jeff Kennett! I know we on this side of the House are not known for quoting the Premier of Victoria to support our arguments, but what did he have to say on the Prime Minister's people's convention? He said that the convention will only express the `personal views' of those participating. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They may argue they represent a greater number of people, but finally this is going to be decided by each and every one of us. A convention to me is just another committee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What else did the Premier of Victoria have to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's not much point calling out 400 people out of a community of 18 million, sitting them down and saying, `Now, what do you think about it?'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, the Victorian Premier made this comment before the government settled on its numbers for the convention. Mr Kennett obviously credited his party colleagues with a little bit more generosity when it came to choosing how many people could participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the Australian people are so wary of the convention is extremely concerning. The question of a republic is intrinsically about them and for them. It affects our whole identity, as we see ourselves and as the rest of the world sees us. For Australians to be so dismissive of the convention, something which the government has chosen to make a major part of the republic decision making process, is, quite frankly, to me very alarming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Geoffrey Blainey, another man we on this side of the House are not known for quoting at length, made this point in relation to the people's convention:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The convention has got to really have the respect of the great majority of Australians. If it's a convention that's selected on the formula that really isn't representing all ranges of Australian opinion, then the public isn't going to take too much notice of the findings of that people's convention.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And, of course, it does not have the respect and it is not going to represent all ranges of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3389"> Australian opinion. Half of its members are to be appointed by the government and half of them are to be elected by who knows how many Australians in a popularity contest akin to the Logie awards&mdash;to paraphrase the Leader of the Opposition. The parliamentary delegates appointed by the government may represent the parliamentary balance, but they do not represent the voting balance. Areas like the ACT have been robbed of equality of representation. The list goes on. The most populated state, which I represent&mdash;New South Wales&mdash;has lost some of their delegates. Each point is an example of how deeply flawed this whole process is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Blind Freddy&mdash;yes, even the Prime Minister&mdash;should be able to see that the people's convention is a weak and problematic alternative to the streamlined, consultative approach outlined by us, Labor, in government. So why does he persist with it? This is where we uncover the subtext of the whole sorry mess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having the Australian people lose respect for the process is what the Prime Minister has always wanted. Granted, he has never hid his preference for a constitutional monarchy and he really has hidden his true reasons for pushing for the people's convention. The following quote reveals, I believe, how much confidence the Prime Minister has in his convention, how much he truly believes in the ideals it represents and the public debate it supposedly seeks to promote. This is what he had to say to Alex Mitchell in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> on 25 June 1995. Of course, his comments then were attributed to `a very senior Liberal figure', but we all know it was Mr Howard. This is what he said about a people's convention and on the republic:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can kick the whole thing into touch by calling for a people's convention. The people's convention is a perfect talking shop. It will keep the issue off the party political agenda and the election agenda. With the people's convention up and running, the Liberal Party wouldn't have to say or do anything about the republic. It would effectively bury the issue for as long as we want.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is why we have this bill before the House today. This is where the Prime Minister's heart really lies. Hence the bar codes, the checks on street addresses and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> signed declaration voters will have to make saying they are who they say they are. Hence the expense, the wildly circuitous route he has now embarked all of us upon. All of these are just trimmings to make Australians scratch their heads and say, `Why the hell are we bothering?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we had a Prime Minister who genuinely wanted to present Australians with a clear and unambiguous decision making process on the republic, he would not hobble either side of the debate. Does the Prime Minister not trust Australians to make the right decision on this matter? Does he not trust their judgment on what system is best for them? Apparently not, and anyone who reads the bill before the House now will agree with me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If he really cared about the process, he would address himself to the fact that, at best, his convention will be an expensive diversion or an irrelevance. At worst, rather than clearly presenting both sides of the debate for the people to consider, it will spew forth a lot of hot air, smoke and political point scoring&mdash;displays which, as we know from our own experiences, the majority of Australians just cannot and will not abide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments being put forward by us in opposition must be picked up if we are to make the best of a bad lot. At the very least, it may help us avoid some of the confusion and animosity which is going to develop over the people's convention. Such controversy is destined to taint the whole republic decision making process for a great many Australians and it will, by that, diminish us as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that, at present, the Prime Minister of this country is not only allowing this to happen but also crossing his fingers and hoping to hell it does happen is an indictment of the kind of national leader we have and, more particularly, of this bill being put forward by the government before this parliament today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again I appeal for commonsense to prevail in this debate. They are sensible amendments. We have said that we do not have the numbers to stop the bill, but more importantly at least consider the process in which this country must go about deciding on a republic. We must have proper debate, but more im 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3390"> portantly it must be done after proper consultation with the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say that this postal vote really is going to go to all of the people, their own evidence tells them, through their estimates committees in the Senate, that some two million people move addresses between each election. It has even been estimated that nearly three million people have moved over the last 16 months and that all could be denied the right of even a postal vote because the Electoral Commission does not have the expertise or the wherewithal to have that right vote go to that right person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can anyone tell me that, when they receive that vote in the mail, which is supposed to be a secret ballot, they are not going to sit down and talk? What are we going to do about those who cannot understand enough English? Are we going to deny them the right of a say in the future of this country? I think the amendments must get up for these reasons. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contributions that have been made so far in this debate on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill really highlight the division that exists across all political boundaries on the wider issue of a republic. I do not approach this bill with any great enthusiasm, I must concede. I do not think that what Russell Ward described in his book as the Australian legend will come to fruition with the vehicle of this sort of legislation. If anything, in the 20 years since I read that book, Australia has moved away from the notion of an Australian legend more than it has at any other time in its history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I noted in my maiden speech, the Americanisation of our culture concerns me. If the movement to a republic, which is being championed by a number of people who firmly believe that it will assist Australia to grow up, will assist in the process of the Australianisation of our culture, rather than an Americanisation of our culture, then I would be firmly in favour of it. However, I really do not see that happening. Perhaps I am a cynic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that, more than ever, the movement right throughout our culture&mdash;through sport, attitude, political correctness&mdash;is all a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> product of Americanisation. Unfortunately, it has permeated so much of our Australian way of life. The prospect that becoming a republic will somehow or other be the be&hyphen;all and end&hyphen;all of Australia's growth as a nation is somewhat naive, if I can say so with respect to those who hold that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe somewhat cynically&mdash;perhaps it might be said cynically anyway&mdash;that this sort of money ought best be spent on our foreign aid budget than on a process such as this. Having said that, I understand that an election commitment was made and this is a realisation of that commitment. But I am sure that the people in the Horn of Africa, the Aboriginal communities in our society and other places might well scratch their heads if we sat down and explained this to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main purpose of the bill is to establish the process for the election of 76 delegates to the constitutional convention in December of this year. The salient features of that election process are that it is voluntary, of a Senate style and conducted by secret postal ballot. Of course, the legislation does not deal with the agenda for the convention. Just what is going to happen at the convention has obviously excited quite a bit of debate. The legislation does not deal with that, of course, but with the delegate election process only. It is clear, however, that the key questions for examination by the convention are should Australia become a republic and, if so, which republican model should be put to the electorate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before commenting on the republican side of it a little bit more widely than I already have, I should make a couple of comments. The election process would cost about $35.6 million. That is the estimate made by the Electoral Commission, but approximately $40 million might be a more realistic assessment, as was mentioned by the previous speaker. However, an attendance ballot would cost at least $55 million. So I suppose the financial impact of the postal ballot can be defended on that basis alone. Of course, voting for the delegates is not compulsory. This is entirely appropriate, in my view, in the circumstances because the convention will not have decision making powers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3391">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perhaps interesting to note that what may well be a reasonable barometer of public interest in the republic  debate will be the voter turnout itself. I will be very interested to see what sort of voter turnout will emerge on that aspect. In the election campaign and since I think that, of the thousands of people I have spoken to and communicated with, I have had only two people in my electorate speak to me about Australia becoming a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, I suspect that members in similar electorates to mine may well have had a response of that nature. I say that with due respect to my colleague and friend the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), who sits beside me and takes a different view of the matter. The degree of support and interest in his electorate is of a larger magnitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to unity and not division. So, if there is to be constitutional change, it must be achieved through a process that unites rather than a process that divides the community. The constitutional convention process is a high form of community consultation, and it will facilitate the ventilation of a disparate array of views. That is quite clear, as has already been mentioned and as already appears in some of the statements of honourable members who have spoken. There will be differences of opinion, but that does not mean that ultimately there will be division arising out of it. Far better that the wide range of opinions that I am sure will emerge at the convention are ventilated and aired in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, 106 years ago the first National Australasian Convention met in Sydney. That was on 2 March 1891. The purpose of that convention was `to consider and report upon an adequate scheme for a federal constitution'. There were seven delegates from each Australian colony and three from New Zealand, although the New Zealanders were bystanders. They never took federation with the Australian colonies seriously. The 1891 convention was the brainchild of Sir Henry Parkes, an English immigrant, whom Alfred Deakin was to describe as `a large&hyphen;brained self&hyphen;educated Titan'. I am sure, Mr Deputy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Speaker Adams, you will appreciate, as I do, that good things sometimes come in large sizes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the commencement of the convention, Sir Henry Parkes put to the delegates a number of resolutions relating to the proposed federation of the colonies but qualified his submission thus&mdash;and it is an important quote which I will extract in toto:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not submit them as I submit a resolution embodying some principle upon which I have strong convictions in the Parliament of this country; but I submit them as a groundwork on which a debate may be raised on the whole question with which we have to deal, and I submit them with the expectation that they will be freely and unfearingly discussed, amended, negatived, dealt with in whatever way the Convention pleases.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is an important principle, in my view, when considering how this convention should proceed. If the republican issue is freely and unfearingly discussed, amended, negatived and dealt with in whatever way the delegates to the 1997 convention choose, it will be ultimately a process that many would consider worth while. There will be differences of opinion, naturally, but it is the spirit in which one enters into that sort of convention which is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as I said earlier, my main reservation in the republican debate is whether it will lead ultimately to an Australia which is merely a mirror image of the USA. As I said in my maiden speech&mdash;and I repeat&mdash;I do not favour Australia becoming the 51st state of the Union, nor do I want a US style republic for Australia. Australia will remain a constitutional monarchy, if the people of Australia so determine. An Australian republic is not a fait accompli.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to remember the magnificent contribution&mdash;during almost all of my life&mdash;of Queen Elizabeth II, a person whom I hold in enormous esteem. It is nothing to the point to say that she is an English monarch who has occupied that seat by virtue of the hereditary monarchy. We are talking about a person who has brought great credit to an enormously difficult office. Throughout her lengthy reign, she has given us a quiet stability. She has not been undermined by the gutter press and has maintained her dignity through 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3392"> out. She has been a benign, apolitical influence. If Australia is to be a republic, we need a president who displays these same qualities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can we expect to get that from an elected individual? Are we more likely to get it from someone like Queen Elizabeth II? We know we have got it from her; it is clear. When I look at appointees to represent her&mdash;particularly those that have emerged in recent times&mdash;I question sometimes whether those appointees are the sorts of people who bring the unity that is needed to this country. It is very important for the appointed head of state to be apolitical and not to embark upon areas which will bring the Australian community into some form of division. That is why he or she&mdash;presently he&mdash;has to be so careful to behave in that office in a way that will not bring the office into disrepute. It is the same in relation to people like judges as well. But that is another issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is so important, in my view, to be totally divorced from politics. I would hate to see a situation where a third arm of government emerged with a president running around the countryside issuing statements on various matters, unfortunately in conflict with&mdash;or seen to be in conflict with&mdash;the government of the day and causing division in the community. It is important that he does not do that because, ultimately, and I suppose in the case of the present system&mdash;my honourable friend from North Sydney touched on this&mdash;the Governor&hyphen;General may have a role in exercising the reserve powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said by others, not only in this debate but in other places, that those powers should be codified. As someone who lived through the 1975 situation, I tremble at the thought of codification of the reserve powers. In my view, in that very delicate situation at that time, the Governor-General acted quite appropriately. He was put in an intolerable situation by the government of the day and he was made to make a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, I argued at the time that the then Prime Minister deliberately put the Governor&hyphen;General in that position because the Prime Minister knew that he could not win an election unless he got a sympathy vote of some sort. The Prime Minister knew that his 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> course of action would lead to his dismissal. Those who lived through it will remember the enormous tide of support that rose for Gough during that period. On its face, it seemed overwhelming initially. The Governor&hyphen;General at that time gave the people of Australia an opportunity to decide the issue. When people came to vote, we saw the result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I have grave reservations about codification of reserve powers. This is a very complicated subject and one that probably does not really touch upon the debate in hand. I do not really wish to trespass into those areas except to say that I do have grave doubts about codification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wonder about this question of remoteness. I do not want to sound like an apologist for the monarchy. I want to be persuaded that there is something better than we have got&mdash;it is as simple as that&mdash;and that it will foster an Australian image, the development of an Australian identity. I remain unconvinced at the moment, but I am open to change on the issue. I really wonder, when one talks about the remoteness of the Crown, what has happened to the process in this country over the last 20 years in particular. I presume governments have decided not to have the Queen come here to visit. Once upon a time the Queen came here and opened the parliament regularly. She came to open various buildings and those sorts of things. That inspired interest in the monarchy and it inspired the monarch to be closer to the people than she seems to be at the moment. But we do not have that now. Is that part of the process? It is something that has happened over time. We have said that she is remote, but she is made to be remote by the government of the day. Canberra politicians are said to be remote from the community because they are down here. Public servants in Canberra are claimed to be remote because they are not out there in the community. It is getting out there in the community that brings it all together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard, the Prime Minister, is going to travel soon to parts of Australia to discuss certain matters about native title&mdash;to explain things, to not look to be remote, to try to ensure that the consultative process is Australia&hyphen;wide and to involve people in that&mdash;yet we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3393"> say that the Crown is remote because she is sitting in England. But we do not bring her out here any more. It is an odd sort of thing. If we have her, why don't we bring her out here? If we do not want her, of course we do not have to have her. But why don't we recognise that, as Queen of Australia, she should be part of such significant events as the Olympic Games opening and the opening of parliament? But we do not want to do that for some reason. We had the President of the United States walk in here, though, and give a speech to the parliament. Why not the Queen of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day I quote Sir Daryl Dawson, who recently retired from the High Court. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Commonwealth was not born of rebellion, civil war or foreign threat. It was born of the labours of those who had the inspiration to see what the future might hold and the determination to press towards it.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In last year's Budget, delivered less than nine months ago, this Government laid out a plan to turn around Australia's finances and secure our future. Our country had been on a losing strategy&mdash;a path of deficit and debt to the next century.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So we took that problem&mdash;not one of our making&mdash;we faced it and we determined to fix it. You can't fix years of neglect overnight. But our Government laid out its strategy and got on with the job.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Tonight I can report we have made very significant progress.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And tonight I announce measures to consolidate and extend that progress, measures which can secure our objective to put the Commonwealth budget into surplus in this our first term of Government. Our consolidated measures turned around a $10.3 billion Labor deficit and lay out a path to a $1.6 billion Coalition surplus over three years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whilst the former Government was running up deficit and debt our prospects were getting bleaker. Our future choices were getting narrower and harder. But paying our way, and then reducing our debt, means our prospects are getting brighter and our opportunities greater.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the forthcoming year the Commonwealth has no borrowing requirement. In fact for the first time in nearly a decade, this year the Commonwealth will not run up debt. In the coming financial year we will repay it. We will repay over $5 billion of Keating Labor debt.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Government's one third Telstra privatisation is not being done to balance the books. Aside from establishing the Natural Heritage Trust that money is going to retire debt. That money will free future Australians from debt and the debt servicing costs that threatened to choke them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">From the time we came to office to the year 2000&hyphen;01 the Commonwealth's net debt to GDP ratio will halve on current forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, for the second time in a row, I announce that this will be done with no increase in income tax rates, no increase in the company tax rate, no increase in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3394"> wholesale sales tax rate, no lift in the petrol excise. In fact, for the second Budget in a row, tonight I will announce tax reductions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Government's programme of budget repair is being accomplished on the expenditure side. From our coming to office to the turn of the decade, underlying outlays are projected to fall from 27 per cent of GDP to just under 23 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This year's Budget papers provide unprecedented information on our fiscal strategy and economic outlook. It is the first Budget to be prepared in accordance with the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When enacted, that Charter will require all future governments to match the standards of integrity in financial reporting that we are setting today.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The specific measures I am announcing tonight are directed to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">helping families;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">boosting small business;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">creating jobs; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">encouraging saving.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">ENCOURAGING PRIVATE SAVING</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, increasing savings will bring important economic benefits for Australia. It will reduce our reliance on foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With more saving we can finance more of our investment to grow the economy faster and produce jobs. Higher savings will raise the speed limits to growth that have held us back over the past decade.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have outlined the way in which the Government will move from borrowing to saving in the first term of the Howard Government. And now is the time to encourage individuals to save as well.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Tonight I announce the Government's plan to reduce the tax on saving.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Every Australian will be eligible for a 15 per cent tax rebate on their savings. The measure will be introduced in two stages with a 7.5 per cent rebate from 1 July 1998 and the full rebate from 1 July 1999.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The rebate will apply to the first $3,000 of taxable income from savings however derived. For example, the rebate would apply to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whole of the interest earned on $60,000 invested at 5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Alternatively, the rebate can be claimed in respect of any payment of personal contributions into superannuation up to $3,000. A person who pays $3,000 into superannuation will get a $450 tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The 15 per cent rebate applies to the marginal tax rate. For a person on the 20 per cent tax rate it will mean the income they put into superannuation is taxed at just 5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, the savings rebate will benefit around 6 million taxpayers. The bulk of the benefit will flow to individuals with taxable income under $40,000. It will benefit current savers and encourage new savings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a significant encouragement to save in the form of superannuation, but it also provides assistance for individuals who are saving for other life cycle purposes such as education, health care, housing, and retirement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The savings rebate takes the place of Labor's L&hyphen;A&hyphen;W tax cuts which were never paid. This brings to an end that tawdry episode. Other Labor schemes to deduct contributions from take home pay and make Government payments into superannuation couldn't have worked. And they were discriminatory&mdash;to one class of saving (superannuation)&mdash;and to one part of society (those in the workforce).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Coalition approach is universal&mdash;open to all Australians and all types of saving. In particular, older Australians who have saved for their retirement are brought in from the cold. They are given the chance to take up the savings rebate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It will equally benefit individuals who have used their savings to build up a business and subsequently derive a return from that business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The savings rebate is estimated to cost $350 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and $1.4 billion in 1999&hyphen;2000.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This measure will provide a saving of $1 billion against the forward estimates in that year over the cost of the previous proposals for Government superannuation payments.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3395">
<PARA STYLE="Para">SUPERANNUATION AND RETIREMENT INCOMES</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Government is also announcing tonight a number of other major measures to improve the operation of our superannuation and retirement income system. These are designed to promote savings, choice, and incentive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Superannuation Preservation Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, the Government considers it important to ensure that savings through superannuation are directed to their intended purpose&mdash;providing income in retirement. It is for this reason that superannuation is given concessional tax treatment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have therefore decided to introduce a number of improvements to the preservation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The preservation rules will be amended from 1 July 1999 to ensure that all future superannuation contributions, including personal contributions, and earnings, will be preserved until preservation age, except in limited circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Benefits which are unpreserved at that date will remain so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As indicated prior to the election, the Government will proceed with a phased increase in the preservation age from 55 to 60 by the year 2025. This proposal was first announced by the former Government in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For someone born before July 1960 the preservation age will remain at 55 years, while for someone born after 30 June 1964 the preservation age will be 60.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Increasing the preservation age to 60 will reduce the gap between the preservation age and the qualifying age for the age pension.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">People retiring prior to age 60 will still be able to access their benefits in the form of a non&hyphen;commutable life pension or lifetime annuity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These preservation reforms will have a very positive effect on national saving and, ultimately, a positive impact on the cost of social security. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Choice in Superannuation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, the Government is also committed to giving Australians more choice and control over their superannuation savings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">From 1 July 1998, employees will be given choice as to which Fund or Retirement Savings Account their superannuation contributions are paid to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They can make their saving work harder for them as providers compete to enhance their performance. It will give employees the power to protect their savings by taking them out of non&hyphen;performing funds.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A Fair Safety Net</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, this Government has introduced legislation to maintain the pension at 25 per cent of Male Total Average Weekly Earnings. We are the first Government to ever do so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And tonight's budget includes this commitment as a specific budget outlay for the very first time. This underlines the Government's commitment to maintain the income of age pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Deferred Pension Bonus Plan</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Government has also decided to introduce a new opportunity for older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">From July 1998 people of Age or Service Pension age will become eligible for a pension bonus if they choose to defer their pension and continue in gainful employment for at least 25 hours per week. The Government will pay a bonus of 9.4 per cent of basic pension entitlement for each year of pension deferral, up to a maximum of five years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bonus will be paid as a lump sum on pension take&hyphen;up. A maximum bonus of $21,251 for a single person and $35,450 for a couple will be payable to those who have chosed to delay retirement for 5 years and have been granted pension at the maximum rate. The bonus will be tax exempt.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">OUTLAYS MEASURES</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, the Government is turning the budget deficit to surplus while meeting high priority spending needs. It is able to do so by reordering spending priorities and targeting programmes more efficiently. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3396">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Families</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In last year's Budget I announced the Family Tax Initiative, which has already begun to provide significant assistance for low and middle income families.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I also announced a rebate of $450 on the cost of private health insurance which will become available for families in seven weeks time on 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our commitment to families does not end there.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are many families across Australia where carers make considerable sacrifices to look after elderly relatives or children with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To further assist such families, the rate of Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefit will be aligned with the Child Disability Allowance from 1 July 1998. This will increase the rate of benefit payable by over 25 per cent and will provide carers who provide home&hyphen;based rather than nursing home care with an extra $16.60 per fortnight at current rates.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In addition, eligibility for the Carer Payment for personal care of a severely disabled person will be extended to those caring for children under the age of 16 with profound disabilities, from 1 July 1998. A full time carer will be eligible for a payment of up to $347.80 per fortnight at current rates.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">From 1 July 1998, new child disability tables will be introduced to provide a more objective basis for assessing the eligibility of applicants for the Child Disability Allowance. New claimants will be assessed against these tables and a Health Care Card will be provided for children with a chronic illness who do not qualify for the Allowance on the basis of the new tables.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Additional funding of $54 million over four years is to be provided under the Commonwealth&hyphen;State Disability Agreement for additional accommodation support for people with disabilities. The measure will allow at least 500 additional families to access personal care and accommodation support for a person with severe or profound disabilities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Rural and Regional Australia</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, the Government strongly values the contribution made by rural and regional Australia. We recognise the exceptionally difficult time it has endured over the past decade.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Rural families make great sacrifices to send their children away for tertiary education. From 1 July access to AUSTUDY will be improved for families who have two or more children away for study. The deduction under the income test for a second and any subsequent child will be doubled to allow more families more access to AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the second half of 1997, the Government will announce a comprehensive rural policy package of $200 million over four years to replace the ineffective Rural Adjustment Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In addition, I announce tonight the provision of an additional $76 million over the next four years to increase our quarantine capacity and improve our quarantine service.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A `best practice' quarantine service is of critical importance to the Australian economy, particularly our rural sector, with disease incursions having potential costs of billions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Quarantine is also vital to human health and the natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Environment</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, tonight's budget includes the $1.25 billion set aside to fund the Natural Heritage Trust over six years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Government was opposed tooth and nail by the Opposition and minor parties in establishing this, the largest restoration programme for Australia's greatest natural asset&mdash;the environment. We have succeeded. The programme to restore our rivers, our vegetation, our land will be of special benefit to rural and regional Australia. A separate statement covering these programmes is being released by the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, tonight.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3397">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Making Government More Efficient</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, tonight's Budget will deliver significant savings in the cost of delivering Government programmes. In 1998&hyphen;99 savings measures amount to around $1.75 billion.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Government has recently announced the Defence Reform Programme to carry out and add to the findings of the Defence Efficiency Review. The review identified ways we can enhance our defence capability. The Government will not reduce defence expenditure; we will get better defence capability by modernisation, enhanced training and reallocation of resources.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Government has decided that its information technology infrastructure will be put out to competitive tendering, which is to be completed by the end of 1998&hyphen;99. This is expected to lead to substantial annual savings of around $100 million in future years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Pharmaceutical Benefits</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Over the past year the Government has taken a number of steps to ensure the sustainability of the health system. Measures to combat unstainable growth in pharmaceutical benefits expenditure will be introduced in 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The practice of price premiums will be extended beyond individual brands of drugs which have identical chemical make&hyphen;up to groups of medicines which have a similar clinical effect. This will build upon the generic pricing policy introduced by the previous Government in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">From February 1 1998, there will be a base price determined by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee for a number of therapeutic groups containing very similar drugs. No patient need pay more. A patient who chooses a brand more expensive than the base price will pay the difference. Based on experience with pricing of alternative brands, price differences are expected to settle in a narrow range of about $2 per prescription. This measure is expected to result in savings of around $560 million over four years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Government has also decided to delete from the Schedule a number of drugs used to treat less serious medical conditions, most of which can be obtained without a prescription, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> resulting in an estimated $112 million in savings over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A National Prescriber Service will be established to help doctors improve the way they prescribe medicines. Around $22 million will be provided for this service over the next four years although this measure is expected to yield savings of around $24 million over the period through better and more appropriate prescribing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Childcare</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Government remains committed to the provision of assistance to low and middle income families so that they can obtain affordable child care and parents can participate in the workforce should they choose to do so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Planning benchmarks will be adopted to influence new long day child care centres to locate in the areas of greatest need, and the number of additional new private child care places which will be eligible for Childcare Assistance will be 7,000 per annum in 1998 and 1999.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There will be a 20 hour per week limit on access to Childcare Assistance where parents use childcare for non&hyphen;work purposes. This measure will ensure Childcare Assistance is used for its primary goal: facilitating workforce participation by parents. There will be appropriate exemptions for families in crisis situations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Without these measures, Childcare Assistance would not remain viable in the longer term. It will still remain one of the fastest growing areas of expenditure in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Public Housing</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Commonwealth will provide $975 million for public housing under the Commonwealth&hyphen;State Housing Agreement in the coming year. Efficiencies in public housing reform will yield savings of $50 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">New Initiatives</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, this Government will not let down those genuinely requiring income support. We will guarantee a decent safety net for those who require it. And, where possible, we will provide the opportunity for those on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3398"> income support to give something back to the community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This budget funds up to 10,000 places in 70 pilot projects to Work for the Dole. In the pilot phase, priority will be given to young people aged 18&hyphen;24 years who have been unemployed for at least six months. Projects will involve two to two and a half six hour days per week.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This initiative will give young unemployed people the chance to add to their experience and develop their work ethic through participation in projects which will be of lasting value to the community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Projects will be focused on regions with the highest levels of youth unemployment. There will be an emphasis on non&hyphen;metropolitan areas in selecting suitable projects. The Government has allocated an additional $21 million over two years to fund these places from late this year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Federation Fund</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, in four years time, our nation will celebrate its centenary&mdash;100 years since federation. Naturally, it will be a time for remembering and marking our achievements. Tonight I announce the establishment of a new fund&mdash;the Federation Fund&mdash;to comprise $1 billion to fund projects of national significance as part of the centenary activities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It will fully fund projects, augment existing funding, or contribute on a matching basis with other governments and the private sector. The projects are to be well advanced but not necessarily completed by the Centenary of Federation in 2001 and will be selected on the basis that they will generate jobs in the construction phase and make a significant and ongoing contribution to Australia and the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There will be a geographic spread of projects around Australia. Projects will be selected by the Commonwealth Government in consultation with State and Territory Governments. The National Museum of Australia will be one of the projects. Funding will commence in 1998&hyphen;99 and it is expected to conclude in 2001&hyphen;2002. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">REVENUE MEASURES</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This Budget continues the Government's commitment to reducing tax compliance costs for small business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In March this year, the Prime Minister announced the Government's response to the recommendations of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. That response included a number of taxation measures designed to assist small business. It built on measures to free small business from capital gains tax on rollover of assets or business. It provides a record keeping exemption available to up to half of small businesses paying fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Tonight, I am pleased to announce changes to withholding tax arrangements to further reduce tax compliance costs for small business and reduce the frequency of transactions between business and the Australian Taxation Office. From 1 July 1998, businesses with an annual tax withholding obligation of $25,000 or less, under the Pay&hyphen;As&hyphen;You&hyphen;Earn, Prescribed Payments and Reportable Payments systems, will have the option to remit these payments on a quarterly, rather than a monthly, basis. This measure will allow in excess of 300,000 small businesses the opportunity to defer the remittance of $500 million in withheld amounts in 1998&hyphen;99.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In addition, and in step with commercial trends, payments by large withholders (that is, those with annual an withholding obligation in excess of $1 million) are to be made earlier and by electronic means. The revenue bring forward from this change will offset the revenue deferral costs associated with the new arrangements for small business and provide a one&hyphen;off gain in 1998&hyphen;99.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am announcing tonight a range of further measures to enhance tax system integrity. These are not measures to increase revenue but are designed to guard against the potential erosion of revenue in the future. For example, I am announcing measures to protect the integrity of the company tax imputation system, to deal with dividend streaming and franking credit trading.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am also announcing tonight the Government has responded to submissions from small 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3399"> business and will ensure legislation dealing with the use of trust losses does not affect closely held family trusts utilising losses in the family group. However, it is now clear that the taxation of trusts must be considered more generally and the Government will release a discussion paper on this issue later this year setting out issues and possible ways of approaching them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Government will monitor taxation developments as they arise and will take whatever action is appropriate to preserve the integrity of the tax system, including the option of acting before the next budget.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, this year's Budget is forecasting excellent economic prospects.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Economic growth is expected to strengthen to 3&frac34; per cent in 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Underlying inflation is expected to remain low at only 2 per cent through the year to June 1998.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 8 per cent over the course of 1997&hyphen;98 as employment growth accelerates.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The stronger outlook for 1997&hyphen;98 reflects stronger private consumption, the recovery in the housing sector and continued strong business investment. Business investment is expected to rise by around 8 per cent following exceptional growth in 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Despite the expected pick&hyphen;up in activity and stronger investment, the current account deficit should increase only slightly as a share of GDP. That, in part, reflects the positive effect of the increase in public saving from Commonwealth debt reduction.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Nevertheless, at around 4 per cent of GDP the current account deficit remains high, underscoring the need for the further savings outlined in this Budget.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">CONCLUSION</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, the Budget I have brought down tonight takes us further down the path which will build a future of opportunity for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It continues and consolidates the strategy begun last year to turn around the finances of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Commonwealth. It puts in place choice and incentives.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr Warwick Smith</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. The Government is very aware of community concerns about the environmental impact of telecommunications facilities roll out by the carriers. The Government has taken legislative action to address these concerns. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3407">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Network deployment decisions (what to build and when and where to build it) are matters for the commercial judgement of the carriers and their associates. Additional infrastructure investment will not occur unless there is an expectation of user demand for the additional capacity, and a commercial judgement about the need for a carrier to control its own facilities rather than simply interconnect with those of another carrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should not be assumed that competing telecommunications facilities necessarily duplicate each other. The rapid changes in technology and customer demands that characterise the telecommunications industry provide significant incentives for carriers and service providers to continually explore new and differentiated product applications, and therefore different (but in some cases superficially similar) forms of infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Facilities based competition (under which each carrier builds its own facilities to carry at least some part of its services) has been central to the development of open telecommunications in most countries. In Australia, in the case of telephony, it has delivered lower prices for consumers, greater investment in equipment and a wider range of choices of services for consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No. I am advised by my Department that, on the basis of available information, cable television services in Europe and North America are provided by a range of technologies, including aerial and underground cabling, wireless transmission and satellite transmission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Upon coming to power, the Government reviewed the rules governing the manner in which telecommunications networks are rolled out. On 1 January 1997, following the review, the Government introduced a package of measures which ensures community access to new telecommunication services are preserved. The package includes:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a Land Access Code; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> legislation to subject the carriers to State and Territory planning and environment laws from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Telecommunications National Code is to set out uniform rules for the installation and maintenance of telecommunications infrastructure. The Land Access Code establishes uniform national requirements that carriers must observe when entering land to carry out activities. It also sets out the rights of land owners and occupiers in relation to such activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two Codes will operate from 1 January until 30 June 1997 and are subordinate instruments under the Telecommunications Act 1991. This legislation is the basis upon which the carriers have made substantial investment commitments of many 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> billions of dollars, in good faith, since its introduction in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new Telecommunications Bill 1996 was recently introduced into Parliament. If passed, from 1 July 1997 carriers' rollout of infrastructure will generally be subject to State and Territory planning and environment laws. Depending on what the applicable State or Territory law says, a particular telecommunications facility will need planning approval from either a State or local Government body. There will be only three limited exceptions to this rule. Under these arrangements broadband cable will not be deployed aerially without the agreement of the relevant State or local authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Yes. Mayor David Plumridge, President of the ALGA wrote to the Prime Minister on 25 September 1996 requesting that the PM chair a `roundtable' conference of representatives from Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments and the ALGA. The letter proposed that the objectives of the conference would be to seek `commitments from Government to underground telecommunications cables wherever possible in the short term, and to develop a program for the undergrounding of all aerial infrastructure in the longer term'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports a forum to examine these issues. On 3 December 1996 the Minister for Communications and the Arts announced that the Government would be convening a Working Group to consider issues `relating to moving existing utility and communications cabling underground.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Working Group will comprise participants from Commonwealth, State/Territory governments, communications carriers, and peak bodies representing local government, business, consumer and utility providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister expects to be in a position to announce the composition of the Group shortly. The initial meeting of the Working Group will be scheduled as soon as practicable after that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. However, I am advised that the Australian Securities Commission (`ASC') is not aware of the source of the statistic quoted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The ASC receives thousands of complaints each year. Due to the often highly complex and costly nature of corporate investigations, it is not possible for the ASC to formally investigate all reported matters. To allocate investigative priorities, the ASC has developed guidelines for assessing complaints. Those guidelines are flexible and are formulated to allow for independent consideration and assessment of every matter drawn to the ASC's attention. Judgments are made on the basis of a comprehensive range of factors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that the ASC will generally allocate resources to investigate matters on the basis of factors including whether:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the matter involves repeated contraventions, continuing misconduct or the risk of continuing misconduct;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am further advised that where a matter, on its merits, meets the ASC's criteria for resourcing, the ASC may decide not to pursue an investigation because of practical factors including:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the fact that other remedies or possible action is being or may be pursued by others, which provide an adequate response to the conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The size of the losses involved and the frequency with which they occur are two of the many factors which are relevant to the ASC's decision to investigate a matter. Neither of these factors are determinative or considered in isolation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reports from receivers and liquidators are also taken into account by the ASC in determining whether to formally investigate a matter. All reports received by the ASC are individually assessed against the criteria. Apart from prompting an investigation, adverse liquidators' reports may also lead to the disqualification of a person from managing a corporation if that person has been a director of the corporation.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Prior to 1996 there was no requirement for Austudy applicants to state whether they were primary producers or not. This information was collected for the first time in 1996, but only in respect of <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">new Austudy applicants applying for assistance as dependent students</EMPHASIS> . The following statistics relate to this sub&hyphen;set of Austudy applicants only, and cover the period 1 January to 30 November 1996. The data required to answer to this question were not collected prior to 1996 when the Actual Means Test was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) For 1996 continuing students were not asked if their parents were primary producers. Therefore, no data are available on how many student children of primary producers received Austudy from 1995 and again in 1996. Some 4 800 student children of primary producers who applied for Austudy for the first time in 1996 received Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) In total, some 12 500 students were excluded from receiving Austudy in 1996 due to the introduction of the Actual Means Test. Of these, some 1 100 were student children of primary producers who applied for Austudy for the first time in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Between 1 January and 30 November 1996 Austudy assistance totalling some $13.2m was paid in respect of the 4 800 student children of primary producers (as described in the answer to (2)).</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) There are no recent estimates of lost export income as a consequence of USA tariffs and duties. A study on the cost of US apparel protection arrangements to Australian wool growers was conducted in 1991 by ABARE and published in the Agriculture and Resources Quarterly, Vol 3, No 1, March 1991. The study concluded that if the US eliminated its apparel protection (i.e. tariffs and quotas), the estimated net returns to Australian wool growers over twenty years could be $450 million (in 1991 dollars). There are no quotas imposed by the US on imports of Australian wool or woollen textiles and clothing. However quotas are still imposed on imports of textiles and clothing from certain developing countries, many of which are among Australia's best customers for wool. These quotas reduce demand for Australian wool by reducing US textile and apparel import demand from other countries which import Australian wool. The United States is committed to phasing out import quotas on textiles and clothing products by 2004. In the implementation of these commitments, a majority of wool products are in the latter stages of the phasing out period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Government is strongly pressing its concerns over market access for wool and woollen products into the US on a number of fronts. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia has repeatedly raised in its bilateral consultations with the United States the high tariffs facing our wool exports. Wool was identified in the Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement released in February 1997 as one of the key sectoral priorities for Government efforts in the US market over the next two years and the issue will be on the agenda of the next officials consultations on agriculture planned for the second half of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the multilateral front, Australia will be promoting efforts to liberalise wool tariffs in the next round of multilateral agriculture negotiations scheduled for 1999. Australia is taking a leading role in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in pressing for comprehensive negotiations on industrial tariffs, including tariffs on textiles and clothing. Once these negotiations are joined by member countries, Australia will be seeking to direct attention to the tariff and non&hyphen;tariff barriers restricting the trade of woollen textiles and clothing in all countries, including the USA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Multilateral agricultural negotiations under the Uruguay Round delivered some cuts in the tariffs on both greasy and semiprocessed wool as well as on wool yarns and we are beginning to see the benefits of this. As one of the Uruguay Round outcomes, the US is cutting the tariffs on a range 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3414"> of woollen products including on greasy fine wool by 15 per cent, on combed wool in fragments by 52 per cent, on wool tops by 50 per cent, and on wool yarn by 33 per cent over the implementation<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS> period to the year 2000. Tariffs on wool fabric will also be reduced by an average of 18% over this period, and those on finished garments generally reduced by between 12 and 22%.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another outcome of the Uruguay Round is the phasing out by the end of 2004 of quota restrictions on textiles and clothing under the Multi&hyphen;Fibre Arrangement (MFA) and integration of this sector into World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. This will have an indirect benefit for Australian wool exports to developing countries, some of which are among our major customers for Australian wool. In the long term, these countries will have greater access to the US and other markets. The proposed timetable, however, discriminates against wool as the US has decided to integrate the majority of wool products in the last stage of the phasing out period. Australia will continue to urge the US to reconsider its phase&hyphen;out timetable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the December 1996 WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore, I emphasised the disadvantages faced by wool exporters due to trade restrictions on woollen textiles and clothing. I urged WTO members, including the USA, to fully implement their Uruguay Round obligations. The Ministerial Declaration of the 1996 Singapore WTO Conference highlighted the importance of woollen products for developing countries&hyphen; our export customers for wool. The issue has also been raised by Australia in the context of the WTO Trade Policy Review Mechanism which reviewed US trade policy in November 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also looking at the North American Free Agreement (NAFTA) which in 1994 established a free trade area encompassing the US, Canada and Mexico, as another opportunity for</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">increasing indirect exports of Australian wool into the US market in the form of textiles and garments manufactured in Mexico. Bilateral trade negotiations between Australia and Mexico in 1995 resulted in Mexico eliminating its 10% tariff on scoured wool and wool tops. This development has significantly improved the prospects for increased processed wool exports to service Mexico's growing wool textile industry which under NAFTA has increasingly liberal access to the US market (for wool textiles and apparel). Following further bilateral trade talks in 1996, Mexico eliminated its 10% tariff on wool noils (wool removed during combing) and waste. These developments will mean a significant boost to Australia's wool exports to Mexico and will benefit the industry as a whole.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) In April 1996 the United States Government made representations to Australia concerning the possibility of Australia standing for re&hyphen;election to the ILO Governing Body for the 1996&hyphen;1999 term. However, the Government had already decided not to stand, in accordance with a policy commitment to play a more circumspect role in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3416"> ILO in order to achieve budgetary savings. The United States has not commented since being advised that Australia would not reverse its decision not to stand for re&hyphen;election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Australia independently formed the view that trade and labour standards was not an appropriate subject for the World Trade Organisation. As it happened, the vast majority of other WTO members arrived at a similar view. It was therefore not a question of Australia supporting the views of ASEAN or any other countries on this subject. The United States was in favour of a work program on trade and labour standards in the WTO and made this known to us, both multilaterally and bilaterally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Yes. There has been some correspondence with the United States (and other countries) on these issues, outlining positions taken, as you would expect on matters concerning international organisations such as the WTO and ILO.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) A campaign was conducted to inform registered denominations and authorised marriage celebrants of the change, from 16 to 18 years, to the marriageable age for females in 1991.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department did not contact the clergy of the recognised denominations directly but their nominating authorities received a letter in July 1991 notifying them of the amendments and asking them to notify the authorised celebrants in their organisations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The curfew is enshrined in legislation through the Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995. That legislation imposes penalties for curfew breaches. Decisions to prosecute breaches of the Sydney Airport Curfew Act are a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is the intention that evidence of alleged breaches of the Act during the Olympic Games will be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions in the same manner as would be the case at any other time.

The declared landing distance available is 1920m for Runway 16L, and 2400m for Runway 34R, which means it is suitable for landings by B747 aircraft in some circumstances.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) During the 1997 Grants cycle over 3000 applications for research funding were received of which I approved 640. The specific Sinker project to which the Honourable Member refers, was not one of these funded research proposals. However, allied projects in the field of robotic and vehicle automation, such as autonomous excavation and enhanced operator&hyphen;aided quay&hyphen;cranes, with commercial applications in primary and other industries have been funded by the Commonwealth for the same group of researchers from the University of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The robot was designed and built in the Graduate School of Engineering at the University of Sydney.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The Sinker robot has many applications across various fields within primary industries, these include the areas of Agriculture, Fishing and Mining, as well as having practical uses in other areas such as defence and the environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Office of Asset Sales (OAS) prepared a letter addressed to the Managing Director of the Westgate Holding Group, stating that the Commonwealth had been unable to agree to terms with the preferred bidder, Foxerco, that the current sale process had been concluded and that the Government would not be undertaking negotiations with other bidders. The letter was prepared against the contingency that the Commonwealth would be unable to agree to terms with Foxerco. The letter was forwarded in error, for which OAS wrote to Westgate on 7 January 1997 to apologise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) As with the letter, a draft media statement was prepared against the contingency that the Commonwealth would be unable to agree to terms with Foxerco. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3426"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) I considered the terms proposed by Foxerco in its offer of 3 December 1996 to be inadequate. When advised of my view on 23 December 1996, Foxerco requested&mdash;and I agreed&mdash;to keep negotiations open. Negotiations between OAS and Foxerco re-commenced early in January 1997 at which time Foxerco made a revised offer which was acceptable to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Foxerco paid the Commonwealth $1.5m for the shares in AAG plus a base rent of $ 150,000 per annum (indexed by CPI after the end of the first year) associated with the long-term lease (50 years plus a 49 year option) of the Airport. The Commonwealth will also receive a commercial proportion of future revenue growth generated at Avalon Airport This represents some $1 lm in net present value terms (over 20 years) based on current revenue projections and is an acceptable economic return on these assets for the Commonwealth. This was confirmed by written advice to the Government from the Government's independent business advisers (KPMG Corporate Finance)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale and long-term lease meets the Government's primary objectives of maximising proceeds for the taxpayer, maintaining Avalon as an operational airport, maximising the prospects of viable commercial development at Avalon and the Geelong community generally in terms of employment and bringing new industry players to the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Yes. Short-listed parties, which included Westgate and Foxerco, were provided with sufficient opportunity to make a commercial offer. They were invited to submit initial expressions of interest by 25 January 1996; conditional indicative offers by 17 June 1996; and after undertaking detailed due diligence, final offers by 24 July 1996. On 24 September 1996, the Government announced that Foxerco had been selected to enter into contract negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Yes, however the content of the Commonwealth's legal advice is confidential and will not be released. The nature of that advice confirmed the Commonwealth's authority to undertake negotiations with Foxerco during January 1997.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The amount of money a person is required to pay to be registered as an agent varies and depends on the category of registration being applied for. The current scale of fees for registration as a migration agent is set out in the table below.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) Yes. There is no provision in the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Act 1992 (the Act) to refund registration fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(b) The fees levied for registration as a migration agent were set at the time the Migration Agents Registration Scheme (the Scheme) was established in September 1992 and are increased in line with the formula set out in section 6 of the Act. Registration fees have not been calculated according to costs for processing individual registration applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather the Scheme has been designed to operate on a full cost recovery basis. Thus registration fees have been determined on the basis of the total cost of administering the Scheme, including registrations and a complaints investigation/determination mechanism, as well as funding grants to assist  voluntary agencies to provide free immigration advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) It would be necessary to amend the legislation to allow refunds of application levies for registration and renewal of registration as a migration agent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) In the absence of any action to reduce the holdings of research reactor spent fuel at Lucas Heights, the storage facilities would reach capacity in the second half of 1998.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The decline in abundance of many species of native fauna and flora is due to a range of factors including the impact of feral animals. While a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3439"> number of studies have indicated the impacts of individual species of feral animals on some native species there are no comprehensive figures available which would enable the allocation of total impacts of individual species of feral animals on all native species, nor the separate allocation of declines in individual native species to the particular feral animals which may have an impact on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is clear evidence, however, that feral predators such as the feral cat and European fox have caused the decline and extinction of native animals on islands. They also have been shown to prevent the re-introduction of native species on mainland Australia. Feral herbivores are known to compete with native animals and cause land degradation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capacity to measure impacts is complicated by the extent of land use changes since European settlement. Thus the difference in some extinction rates may be attributable to changes and differences in habitat rather than indicating that there is a direct cause and effect. For example, the introduction of rabbits had three effects. Firstly, rabbits competed with native animals for food, especially during drought . Secondly, they displaced certain burrowing marsupials. Thirdly, the spread of rabbits has provided a ready food source for introduced predators, thereby contributing to the maintenance of high densities of such predators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has allocated $16 million over five years to the National Feral Animal Control Strategy, which will address feral animal issues by:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Queensland Department of Natural Resources estimates that Rubber vine densely infests over 700,000 hectares of tropical and sub&hyphen;tropical Queensland between the 400 and 1400 millimetre isohyets but is present across 34.6 million hectares. The major infestations are in the catchments of the Gulf rivers (from the Mitchell to the Northern Territory border), Burdekin River and lower Fitzroy River. Scattered infestations occur in the Lake Eyre and Murray&hyphen;Darling Catchments and coastal rivers south of Rockhampton. Rubber vine has the potential to spread to the Northern Territory, tropical regions of Western Australia and other parts of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) To this point in the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year no Commonwealth funding has been applied to the National Weeds Strategy to address Rubber vine. A National Weeds Strategy Executive Committee comprising State and Commonwealth representatives from agriculture, environment and forestry interests has recently been formed to oversight implementation of the National Weeds Strategy. One of the first tasks of this Committee has been to review the existing strategy for Rubber vine as a precursor to seeking funding support to implement elements of the Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Commonwealth Government, through the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio, has not taken any steps to progress trials and use of biological controls to combat Rubber vine at this point in time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Section 80 of the Defence Act 1903 creates an offence of personating a member of the Defence Force in order to avoid payment of a fare or toll. It is assumed that the honourable member intended to refer to regulation 80 of the Australian Rifle Club Regulations, which were formerly in force under the Defence Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> Regulation 80 provided, in part, that it was not necessary for a member of a rifle club under or by reason of any law of a State or Territory to obtain or have any licence or permission for the use of rifles and other firearms on rifle ranges and for the possession, use and carriage by a member of a rifle club of such rifles and other firearms as were approved for use on the rifle range.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> The regulation applied to members of rifle clubs formed or deemed to have been formed under the Regulations. The regulation only operated to provide an exemption from licence or permit requirements under State or Territory law. It did

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Australian Rifle Club Regulations, including regulation 80, were repealed by Statutory Rules 1997, No. 4, with effect 12 February 1997.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. I have received briefings from the Chief Government Information Officer from the Office of Government Information Technology (OGIT), who first brought this issue to the attention of all Commonwealth agencies in May 1996. Year 2000 compliance plans are currently being lodged with OGIT. OGIT keeps me informed and is in constant liaison with the US and UK governments, industry associations, the Reserve Bank and other major banks, suppliers and Year 2000 service providers</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have had discussions with a senior official from one of the major banks and with the UK's Chief Scientific Adviser. OGIT has formed a Commonwealth&hyphen;State Committee which will be reporting to the On&hyphen;Line Government Council. The Committee aims to assist agencies to resolve the Year 2000 date issue on a whole of Government basis and avoid duplication between State and Commonwealth activities. The Council considered this issue at its recent inaugural meeting. Arrangements are in hand to form a peak body of industry associations and government representatives to keep me advised and to ensure progress is sufficiently rapid across all sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) I have not held discussions on this issue directly with CSIRO or the universities. OGIT has been contacted by a number of financial institutions. Advice to date indicates that the finance industry is well aware of the Year 2000 problem and corrective action has been or will be taken in good time. Other large private sector businesses also appear to be moving on this issue but there may be insufficient awareness by smaller enterprises. Accordingly, I addressed the National Small Business Forum in November 1996, provided an article to the National Small Business Newsletter and have issued several media statements on this topic.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3477">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) I have not had direct discussions with other Ministers but have overseen consultations at the departmental level. Those departments have been asked to submit compliance plans to OGIT. The Minister for Finance has been kept informed by OGIT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The cost for the Commonwealth and the State governments has not been established, neither has a figure been established for the private sector. However, according to Gartner Research, the cost is somewhere between $300 billion and $600 billion worldwide. If this is correct, the cost to Australian business and government could be between $3 billion and $6 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) There is a problem. It is being taken seriously by government and the private sector and my Department will continue working to raise awareness of the issues across all industry sectors whenever possible.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) are you aware that the Mid Plan report on the National Action Plan for Dementia Care noted the vital importance of dementia counselling services, largely developed through State Alzheimer's associations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) If you are aware of this, why is the Government withdrawing funding for the five rural counsellors in New South Wales, including Orange and Dubbo, and expecting such services to be mainstreamed through the Home and Community Care service, which is underresourced and underskilled, to carry out such a vital service for the increasing number of home based rural dementia patients.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) and (2) I am aware of the report and the Department of Health and Family Services has been working with the Reference Group in response to the proposed actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Counselling services are an initiative of the National Action Plan for Dementia Care. The Government recognises that the needs of people with dementia and their carers will not cease when the Action Plan ends.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure to introduce a single classification system and assessment instrument across the residential care sector from 1 July 1997 will ensure that residents will be funded according to their care needs no matter where they are. The development of this new instrument will take proper account of both the physical and mental frailty of residents and match this to an appropriate level of funding. Consistent with and complementary to the Reform Package is the National Carer Action Plan which aims to improve support for carers, including carers of PeoPle with dementia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clearly evident that adequate training and appropriate buildings and environment are critical to the appropriate care of people with dementia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that if the objective of good quality dementia care is to be achieved fully, this care must come primarily from mainstream care systems. The August 1996 Budget measures are designed to achieve this.</PARA>
