<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Yellow Pages survey of 1,200 small businesses, released today, shows that Australia's small business sector sees no sign of economic recovery and that more than 80 per cent of businesses surveyed see the economy as being in a recession or at a standstill? Is he also aware that the survey reports that small business proprietors' confidence has reached its lowest point since August 1993 and that support for the government's policies has plummeted from 42 per cent to 14 per cent in 12 months? As the survey postdates his statement to this parliament on small business on 24 March last, what additional action is the government planning to restore some level of confidence in the sector?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the report, and can I say to the small business community of Australia that, unlike the previous government, this government will not arrogantly dismiss the concerns of small business on the basis of, `What are you going on about?' or `You have never had it so good.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remain very conscious of the fact that the small business community of Australia was very badly savaged by the recession of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> late 1980s and the early 1990s, and we have taken a number of measures to remedy that situation. The Leader of the Opposition gives me the opportunity of reminding the parliament and the small business community of Australia that since we have been in office there have been reductions in small business interest rates of between 1&half; and two per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I repeat the call that I made yesterday to the major banks of Australia that under no circumstances should the major banks of Australia discriminate against small business. We regard as quite unacceptable the notion that interest rate reductions should be afforded to big business but not to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition said that the Yellow Pages survey postdated an announcement that I made in the parliament about small business measures. I remind him that it predates the federal budget, which was a major confidence booster to small business.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It also predates the most recent reduction in interest rates but, most importantly, I hear calls from the other side of the parliament: what are we going to do about it? I might well return that and say: why don't you agree to pass the latest unfair dismissal changes? If you are really interested in doing something about small business, you would do something to assist those very small firms in Australia. You are talking about firms that employ fewer than 15 people. You are talking about the heart and soul of small business. What they continue to complain about is the unfair dismissal laws, and the refusal of the Australian Labor Party to support our proposals in that area demonstrates that since the last election the Labor Party has learnt absolutely nothing on this front.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the small business community of Australia: the interest rate changes of recent months are working their way through the economy. They will have beneficial effects over coming months. The capital gains tax changes will come into operation on 1 July. I say to the small business community of Australia: we understand your problems. We don't sneer at you. We don't dismiss your problems. We sympathise with you, and you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4092"> will never get from this Prime Minister an arrogant dismissal on the basis of `You have never had it so good' and `What are you going on about?'</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of further movements in home loan interest rates over the past 24 hours? What would such a movement indicate about the government's policy of delivering consumer benefits through fostering competition?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4092" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for her question. I can inform the House that, in the last hour, the ANZ Bank has led the way with another reduction in the variable home loan rate. ANZ today announced a further reduction in home loan interest rates: the standard variable home loan rate for owner occupiers will fall to 6.99 per cent from tomorrow&mdash;the lowest home rates generally available to mortgage borrowers since 1969, since man first walked on the moon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction in the home loan rates is a result of the reductions in the home loan rates from when this government came to office. When this government came to office, the standard variable home loan rate was 10.5 per cent and it is now 6.99 per cent&mdash;a reduction of 3.55 percentage points since this government was elected. In interest savings on a $100,000 loan, that represents an interest saving of $292 a month&mdash;after tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, if you want to compare that to the Labor Party's record, in 1989 the Keating Labor Party, of which the Leader of the Opposition, his deputy and his new industry spokesman were members, had home mortgage rates at 17 per cent. On a $100,000 home loan, that gave you an interest bill of $1,417 a month. On the ANZ rate offered today, you would make a saving against that of $834 a month&mdash;$834 a month from where the Labor Party had home mortgage rates in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the government's policy, which was opposed on every point by the Labor Party, to lock in monetary targets and low inflation with an agreement between the Reserve Bank 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the government. The Labor Party threatened to sue. It was our policy to turn from a $10.3 billion deficit to a $1.6 billion surplus. The Labor Party voted against all of those measures. It was our policy to say that if we kept wages down we would get benefits in relation to interest rates. The Labor Party went into the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and tried to have an increase in wages which would have been unsustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the party of savings, low deficits, reduced debt and low interest rates; and that is the party of high deficits, high debt, high interest rates, high taxes and no small business accommodation. For people in the electorate of Lindsay, the battlers of Lindsay, represented by the coalition&mdash;because the coalition government now represents blue&hyphen;collar workers in this country&mdash;there is no better benefit you can deliver to them than reducing their home mortgage fees. The coalition government set out on an economic strategy to do that. The benefits are there. They are there for home buyers. They are there for the electorate of Lindsay. They are there for small business. The best that can be said for the Labor Party is that they never succeeded in their campaign to stop these improvements.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his tabling speech in response to the Bell committee report when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we promised small business a new deal at the last election and we are delivering on that commitment . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In light of today's Yellow Pages Small Business Index findings that less than 10 per cent of all small business operators thought that the government's Bell report initiatives would improve their situation, does this not confirm that your government is hopelessly out of touch with the real needs of the small business community and that it has failed to deliver on your commitment?</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4092" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Cunningham for the question. He draws on the Yellow Pages report. I am very happy to extend the practice. That same report 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4093"> says that 62 per cent of businesses now expect to expand. Sixty per cent of businesses are confident about the future. The last time I went to the polls, 60 per cent was a pretty good majority. It was the two&hyphen;party preferred coalition vote in the whole of Queensland. Sixty&hyphen;one per cent of businesses expect an improvement in profitability over the next 12 months. That is the Yellow Pages survey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cunningham invites me to reflect on whether I have delivered on my promises to the small business community at the last election. What were they? The first of them was to do something about the provisional tax uplift factor. If my memory serves me correctly, we have delivered that in full. The next was to do something about capital gains tax concessions for small business. If my memory serves me correctly, we have overdelivered on that particular commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember that we said that we were going to change the industrial relations laws of Australia. If we had been allowed to do so by the Senate, we would have delivered 100 per cent of those. We delivered about 80 to 90 per cent of them as a result of obstruction by the Labor Party and the Democrats in the Senate. We said that we were going to do something about paperwork. We have done that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We said that we were going to do something about the unfair dismissal laws. We have greatly reformed the unfair dismissal laws. We would like to go a little bit further, but of course the Labor Party and the Democrats will not allow us. The Labor Party and the Democrats do not listen to those small business men and women of Australia who would like to have the freedom to take people on probation for 12 months and if it does not work out to let them go. There is nothing wrong with that. Anybody who understands small business will know that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing that the member for Cunningham invites me to refer to is the impact of reduced interest rates on small business. It is undeniable, as the Treasurer said, that if the former government had been returned to office we would not have had a deficit reduction strategy. We therefore would not have had the falls in interest rates that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have occurred over the last 14 months. Although the falls in interest rates for small business are less satisfactory than they are for home buyers, they are nonetheless real, they are tangible and they are valuable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing for the small business community to hear out of all of this is not what the member for Cunningham is saying but to understand that they now have a government that understands them. You now have a government that is not arrogant. You now have a government that is sympathetic to small business. You now have a government that is in touch with small business. I understand that it is taking time for the benefits of those changes to work through. One of them, for example, the capital gains tax changes, will not come into operation on 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say in conclusion that we are in touch with small business. We understand their problems. We realise the pain that was inflicted on small business by the recession. We will continue to develop policies to assist them and, the Senate and the Labor Party and the Democrats willing, we could deliver them out of the bondage of that unfair dismissal restriction if only the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats would agree to pass it.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House what today's capital expenditure figures say about the budget forecasts for investment and what they suggest about prospects for continued growth and job creation?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4093" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The March quarter capital expenditure survey supports the budget forecast for strong growth in business investment in 1996-97. Expectations for total capital spending in 1996-97 continued to rise in the March quarter to be nearly 40 per cent higher than the first estimate for 1996-97. Total business investment rose strongly in constant price terms in the March quarter to its highest level since the survey commenced in the June quarter of 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4094">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Total capital spending in the first three quarters of 1996-97 is 21 per cent higher than it was for the equivalent period in 1995-96. Equipment spending has reached its highest level in constant price terms since the survey began. While growth in building investment rebounded strongly following falls in the previous two quarters, it is now close to its historical high. The outlook for total business investment in 1997&hyphen;98 is positive, with the second estimate for total capital expenditure being 15 per cent higher than the first estimates taken in January&hyphen;February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that tell us about the Australian economy? What it tells us about the Australian economy is that business investment is very strong&mdash;at record levels. This is coming at a time when interest rates are being reduced and are at historical lows. It is coming at a time when the budget is turning from deficit to surplus. We now have the Australian budget on a path, by the year 2000&hyphen;01, to halve the debt to GDP ratio&mdash;to halve the Commonwealth debt to GDP ratio. The underlying inflation rate is projected to be two per cent in the forthcoming year, with a consumer price index of one per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would go a long way to find business conditions which were as conducive to investment as these are. We have low inflation&mdash;inflation back at levels we have not seen since the 1970s&mdash;a budget spinning back into surplus, a Commonwealth debt to GDP ratio halving to the year 2000, home mortgage rates the lowest they have been since the 1960s, and business rates falling accordingly. This is a growth, low inflation, strong investment economy. That is the kind of economy which Australian business needs to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it clear on behalf of this government that it is not this government's purpose to go back to the boom-bust failures of the Keating Labor administration. It is the purpose of this government to put in place the big structural changes which will deliver sustained and sustainable growth on a decade basis. With low inflation and growth on a decade basis we can repair our financial situation, get our debt down and create that business investment environment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today's private new capital expenditure survey results are consistent with that. They indicate the opportunities for business investment in the Australian community. Investment equals jobs and it is investment which will drive job creation in this growth, low inflation economy, which is confirmed by the CAPEX figures today.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Prime Minister, are you aware that in the small business index published today that, for small business, capital expenditure growth is anticipated to be negative and expectations are lower? Did you also see the quote from John Marsden, the consulting economist, who said, `There are now more small businesses across Australia seeing federal government policies as negative than they see as positive'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not read every detail of the survey, but can I say in reply to the Leader of the Opposition that no amount of selective disaggregation of capital investment figures can alter the fact that we are living in an economy now which is growing in confidence every day. We are living in an economy where every day the business community is seeing the benefit of falling interest rates. Every day is seeing the benefit of falling inflation, every day is seeing the benefit of rising levels of capital investment and every day is seeing the benefit of having in power a government that is willing over a period of time to lay the foundations for sustained economic growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition can quote all of the surveys he wishes. Nothing can alter the undeniable fact that he left the new government with a deficit of $10.5 billion. In the first term, we will have turned that deficit into a surplus of $1.6 billion. The expectational effects of that are already being felt. Why else is it that interest rates have fallen so dramatically over the last 14

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise that it is of real concern to him and to the people of his electorate and to many others in this place. Obviously, it is of very real interest to establish how it might have got here. We will be actively exploring all possible pathways for its entry. At this very early stage, it seems reasonable to conclude that it has probably been here for quite a while. However, if something untoward is established over the next little while, we will certainly take the matter further in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can say that we acted very quickly indeed, particularly in the initial days of the problem, in concert with the Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to cordon off the area and to seek as much information 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as we could about how real the problem is. At the moment we have people marching around no less than 8,000 kilometres of trees around the place as we seek to ascertain whether in fact it exists anywhere outside the Botanic Gardens in Melbourne and the Botanic Gardens in Adelaide. We sincerely hope not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other concern, and I dare say a matter of great importance, is that the test results in both New Zealand and in Australia have been somewhat inconclusive. In the interests of the industry, we are assuming at this stage that it is fire blight, although some hope is emerging that it is not a particularly virulent strain. We have sent samples to the leading institute in Germany in this regard, the Max Planck Institute, where Professor Klaus Geider will be seeking to identify&mdash;at arm's length and totally independently&mdash;the exact nature of the problem. He will be visiting us here shortly to again report to us and also work through our testing procedures to establish their veracity in this country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. It is indeed true that the work for the dole initiative has achieved great community support, probably nowhere more so than amongst young Australians, who see the opportunities that the scheme will give them to make a contribution to their communities. It is an initiative which will provide lasting benefits for many thousands of young people in communities around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members will be aware that the government's work for the dole legislation passed through the House of Representatives last night. It did so, of course, despite the opposition of the Australian Labor Party. The differences between the government and the opposition on this matter could now not be clearer. The government supports work for the dole; the Labor Party opposes it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Support for the work for the dole initiative also extends well into the business community. A recent national survey by Morgan and Banks of some 3,200 employers around Australia found that nearly three in five businesses would be more willing to employ someone with experience from work for the dole than without it. Indeed, Mr Geoff Morgan, Joint Managing Director of Morgan and Banks, stated that at a minimum `work for the dole allows people to learn workplace skills and develop a sense of self-worth as an employee'. That is the attitude of the business community in Australia. It is, of course, not the attitude of the Labor Party, which has consistently ignored and denigrated the views of the business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the Labor Party has come clean on work for the dole. It opposes work for the dole. It wants a return to its cruel and deceitful short-term training programs that demoralised so  many young Australians, but it opposes the government's initiative and the fair and equitable character of work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and the Australian people believe that if Australians are working hard to provide support for unemployed people then it is fair to require the person receiving that support to put something back into their community. The work for the dole scheme 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will include both compulsory and voluntary pilots. We believe that is fair and equitable. The Labor Party does not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it quite clear to the Labor Party and to the Australian people that if the Labor Party tries to destroy the work for the dole scheme in the Senate then the government will put that legislation straight back into the Senate again. The Labor Party will have to stand up before the Australian people and tell them that it is opposed to work for the dole. Once again, it will have demonstrated that it is completely out of touch with young people, with Australian businesses and with Australian communities. You are opposed to work for the dole. Your opposition is now out in the open and you will have to live by that decision.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With obstetrics, one of the quiet problems of rural health, we are going to look at alternate ways of funding services in rural areas. One of the most difficult issues that rural women face is getting access to obstetric services. The program we have announced in the budget will look at things such as the limited professional indemnity cover, a lack of training and continuing education for general practitioners, difficulties of getting locums and a lack of peer support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one further issue that we announced in last year's budget that I can inform the House about, and that is the university departments of rural health. These are designed to very simply try to link the gap that currently exists in undergraduate medical and allied health training. At the moment there is no real mechanism to give medical students and other students who wish to pursue a career in country areas the capacity to have a lot more on the ground experience before they graduate. In the last nine months we have announced that there will be centres at Broken Hill, building on the Broken Hill public health unit, and at Mount Isa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing about these centres is that, if they are centres of excellence and parts of university departments, it will mean that someone can actually plan an academic career in rural health&mdash;something that is almost impossible now. Going to the country is often committing academic suicide. If there are university outposts of six places around Australia, they will address this real deficiency. We deliberately did not just call these departments of rural medicine, because health is more than medicine and it is not just designed to meet the needs of the medical profession&mdash;although that is a big part of it. The public health unit at Broken Hill and the Mount Isa unit, for example, will have a very substantial role in Aboriginal health.</PARA>

I congratulate her on her strong advocacy and  I hope she will stop chewing my ear now. The Shepparton unit is a very special and innovative approach. It has the support of the Victorian government. What it is going to do is link a number of universities, not just those with medical schools. It has the support of Monash, Melbourne and La Trobe universities that are forming an alliance to all back the one location of Shepparton. Shepparton will then be an outreach for other centres that will be determined by the University of Melbourne, which is leading it. This state&hyphen;wide approach has not been tried anywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second unit will be at Geraldton in Western Australia, and it will be linked to the University of Western Australia. I thank the honourable member for O'Connor for his strong support of that location. I am sorry that there are not any in any Labor Party seats, but you have to win a few seats in the country before I can actually put one in one of your electorates.

That one will be linked to the University of Tasmania.</PARA>

The climate change negotiations represent a major challenge for Australia's interests, and it is vital that the government stands by those interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House may be interested to know that the United States and the European Union want a common flat rate target for all OECD countries in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. The fact is, though, that this ambition completely disregards the different national circumstances and the relative costs of action to address climate change. Frankly, the consequences for Australia if we were to embrace that sort of proposal would be extremely serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members may be interested to know that a uniform target would make Australia's economy suffer more than that of any other OECD country. Indeed, the costs to each Australian would be 22 times the cost to each European. Frankly, I know the member for Dawson would accept that the Australian government cannot be expected to even contemplate an agreement which places such a disproportionate burden on this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ABARE's 1997 report lists over 35 energy intensive projects, said to be worth nearly $22 billion, which are expected to come on stream by 2010. Those projects would generate more jobs and those projects would of course increase our exports. But an unfair outcome in the climate change negotiations will put those investments at risk. It would put Australian jobs at risk, particularly in regional Australia, and it would put Australia's economic growth and future prosperity at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That explains why the Australian government wants equitable differentiation reflecting 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the individual economic circumstances of all OECD countries as the central theme of the climate change convention. What is disappointing is that the European Union is prepared to accept differentiation for itself, for the 15 members of the European Union, and for eastern European countries. The European Union says that it will accept differentiation for 28 countries but that for the remaining countries&mdash;eight countries&mdash;it will not accept differentiation.

I tell the House that because we are delighted that, a little over a year later, in effect the British government has taken the same position. And I think it is a very good illustration of the leadership role that the Australian government has taken on the issue of landmines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member asked about the Ottawa process and the conference on disarmament. The government is working actively to get negotiations for a global ban up and running. We are currently leading a major push in Geneva to start negotiations at the conference on disarmament. We are also participating in the Ottawa process, and the Australian government will be present at the forthcoming Brussels meeting in the context of the Ottawa process to ensure that that process from our perspective is carried forward constructively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe, however, that the conference on disarmament is the best forum in which to pursue the objectives that we have in terms of antipersonnel landmines.

There were all these things that you could have done for 13 years but, let us face it, you would have, wouldn't you? You would have done it in the 14th year except the 14th year never came.

He passively hid behind an astonishingly defeatist excuse on the issue of antipersonnel landmines by saying, `An immediate ban is not achievable.' So the position the Australian government took in the Vienna meeting in 1995 was a defeatist and negative position. The position this government has taken has been positive and constructive.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for the question. What the Natural Heritage Trust Fund actually reflects is the capacity of the coalition to identify a major problem, to then formulate a set of policies designed to tackle it and then actually implement them, as opposed to what we have seen from the other side whose consistent approach to everything we have tried to do in this regard has been to block it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the trust was a key coalition commitment at the last election. It heralds a new era. It was, as the honourable member pointed out, launched just last Thursday by the Prime Minister. This year alone there was an allocation of $290 million towards the activities of the trust. That is part, of course, of the $1,250 million that will be spent over five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It represents a coordinated and integrated approach to a whole range of environmental issues: land, vegetation, rivers, biodiversity, our coastal and marine reserves. It is not just coordinated and integrated in and of itself in its programs, but it is also relevant to local problems and the local communities that want to tackle those problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is quite an overwhelming number of applications already in. There was an enormous response, particularly in the honourable member's home state, to the first call for the first round of funding. That is now currently, at this very moment, going through the community based assessment process, and the outcomes will be announced in August. It is an open, transparent and accountable approach. There are distinct steps involving local communities who understand and have a feel for the environmental problems that we need to address. It feeds through them to community dominated regional assessment panels, and their recommendations are made to state assessment panels and then referred to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4107">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a process of integrity. There are no whiteboards in this process. It is interesting that those opposite apparently are not capable of understanding a process that does not involve whiteboards. It is a very poor reflection upon them. This is obviously a transparent process, obviously a process of integrity and obviously a process that does not involve whiteboards. Maybe that is why they do not like it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am happy to confirm that there is an initial allocation of $1 million to the Hawkesbury&hyphen;Nepean regional strategy. That is made&mdash;and I can see that members are thoroughly approving of this&mdash;in recognition of the increasing pressures on the resources in that catchment area of about 2.5 million  hectares, involving around one million people and a large variety of plant and animal species, some of them unique to that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is welcome. It is a valuable process. It is interesting to note the opposition from those opposite, because again they cannot respect the process of integrity that is designed to meet real needs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addressing that report, the government must intelligently bring to bear a proper consideration of all of the various options. One of those options, of course, must be the relevance, in a global economy, of tariffs and the relevance of other elements of industry policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I say that the member for Melbourne has done the parliament and the Australian Labor Party a very considerable service. I congratulate him for it; I really do. I think all on this side of the House will congratulate him. He has been prepared to bring a little bit of intellectual rigour compared with the member for Hotham and the member for Batman. To use the language of the debate, it is a bit odd having a left&hyphen;wing dry bringing intellectual rigour to the debate, but basically that is what he has done. He has brought a little bit of intellectual rigour to this debate and in the process he has exposed the absolutely shameless and empty employment policy of the member for Batman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman has the very limited value policy of this part-time work. Don't you understand the changes that have occurred? You were part of the process that produced some of those changes. For you to be talking of the very limited value options of part-time work! You really reserve the sharp point of your intellectual rigour for the member for Hotham. When the next reshuffle is on, Lindsay will be after the industry portfolio. There is not much doubt about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he really said is that there is a danger that the Labor Party will lapse into very knee-jerk industry policy responses. He quite rightly calls for a more rigorous targeting of R&amp;D policies. That is exactly what we did in our first budget. That is exactly what my colleague the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism did. We targeted the policies.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, I would hope that this is a motion that could draw the support of all members of the House. I hope it is a motion that could not only draw the support of the members of the Australian Labor Party but also all Independent members of the House, because it does contain a number of unambiguous statements of fundamental principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It recognises that in 1967, in a quite unprecedented fashion, the Australian people joined in saying&mdash;very loudly and to the effect of over 90 per cent of those who participated in the referendum&mdash;that, unambiguously, they wished Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to be treated as full citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia; that they wanted them in every way to be given that respect. They also resolved, in passing that referendum, to clothe the parliament of the Commonwealth&mdash;this parliament&mdash;with the power to make laws for those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the 1967 referendum was about anything it was about giving power to the Commonwealth government on behalf of the Commonwealth parliament to do practical things to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> address the disadvantage of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The people of Australia made a judgment in 1967 that the then existing arrangements to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were not working effectively and that they could only be made to work more effectively if the Commonwealth parliament were given the power. In a sense, the motivation for the 1967 referendum and the belief that the passage of the 1967 referendum was necessary for the benefit of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is a guide to the policies that should now be followed if we are really committed to assisting those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our approach as a government to the process of reconciliation is very much guided by and heavily influenced by the spirit of the 1967 referendum. If the 1967 referendum spoke of anything it spoke of a need to remedy in a practical way the disadvantage of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. If you want a unanimity of view within the Australian community or a near unanimity of view within the Australian community on issues relating to the indigenous people then you must look at areas of disadvantage in issues such as health, housing, employment and education. Our approach to reconciliation is very much guided by our strong belief that the path to effective reconciliation lies in remedying those areas of disadvantage and through that giving to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the full capacity to enjoy freedom of opportunity as Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the remarks that I made to the Reconciliation Convention yesterday, I deliberately said, and I repeat it in the House today, that we believe that the essence of reconciliation lies not in symbolic gestures&mdash;although some of them are important; this motion in a sense is a symbolic gesture. It is important on these issues that the parliament, as far as possible, speak with one voice&mdash;not in overblown rhetoric but in a practical determination to address the areas of disadvantage that indigenous people suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said repeatedly that anybody who argues that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are not as a group more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4112"> profoundly disadvantaged than other sections of the Australian community are flying in the face of reality. People who argue that are substituting fiction for fact. They are substituting selective anecdotes for irrefutable statistical proof and they are also ignoring the realities that are around us to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That does not mean to say that every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander in Australia is disadvantaged. It does not mean to say that some of the programs over recent years that have been directed to curing their disadvantage have not involved substantial elements of waste and failure. That does not alter the fact that they remain a very disad vantaged group. Even a cursory examination of their health situation, a cursory examination of their employment opportunities, a cursory examination of their educational opportunities rather than educational achievements&mdash;because when given the opportunity they achieve and achieve very effectively&mdash;would refute that proposition. I say on behalf of the government that we accept, we always have and, until the disadvantage is removed, we will continue to believe, that as a group they are disadvantaged. That has to be the cornerstone of a practical understanding of the policies that are brought to bear on their situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We make no apology for the fact that in some areas we have followed somewhat different policies from those of the former government. I am not going to use this as an occasion to go through the policies of the former government. I think this House understands that there are areas where we disagree. I accept that there are many people in the Labor Party who are committed to removing indigenous disadvantage and I am not going to argue the toss about that in a motion such as this, but I invite them to accept that there are many on our side who are equally committed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invite all members of this House to put aside any kind of moral preoccupation with their position on matters affecting indigenous people. I ask all members of this House to accept that nobody has any kind of moral monopoly of concern about indigenous people. I put to you, Mr Speaker, that the policies 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that we are embarked upon, in our view, conscientiously represent the most effective way of achieving outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not obsessed with symbolism. We are concerned, though, with practical outcomes. That is why we have put such an enormous focus in recent months since we came to office on addressing areas of disadvantage. It is why we believe that by addressing that disadvantage we can best give to indigenous people their full opportunity as Australian citizens. It is why, despite the necessities of the time, we have quarantined from any expenditure restraint some of the critical areas in relation to indigenous education. We have in fact expanded expenditure in a number of areas. I am very happy to say that in the last budget we announced a significant expansion of programs which are designed to help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people succeed in their own businesses and generate a greater sense of economic independence and a greater sense of self-empowerment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the 1967 referendum was to give expression to a view that it was completely unacceptable morally and in the sense of our dignity as a nation to continue to regard the first Australians as anything other than full participants in the Australian community. Although indigenous people had had the vote before 1967, they had not been counted in the census and the Commonwealth lacked adequate power to address their very real needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the years that have gone by since 1967, it is worth recording the progress that has been made and the contribution that has been made from a number of governments towards improving the situation of indigenous people. Regrettably, because of the ferocity of debate that often surrounds matters relating to indigenous people, the community could be forgiven for believing that no progress has been made in any area. I think that would do a grievous disservice not only to the truth but also to the contributions of several governments of both political persuasions to tackling the problem.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4113">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the community employment development projects were established in 1977. The community housing and infrastructure program was established shortly afterwards. The health infrastructure policy priority project was also established. The Aboriginal health services have provided much needed health assistance to indigenous people. The national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy began in 1990 and it includes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education strategic initiative programs and also the Abstudy program. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was established in 1991 and the establishment of that body, elected by indigenous people, was designed to represent their views and interests and to implement programs that addressed their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There continues to be within the community, not least within the indigenous community itself, significant debate about the value of the ATSIC system. When coming to power the government decided to retain it. In conformity with our election undertakings, there were changes made and increased levels of accountability imposed, but the structure was retained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would not be possible to do justice to this subject without saying one or two things about two issues that are very much in the public arena so far as indigenous affairs are concerned. The first of those, of course, is the Native Title Act amendments, which are under notice from the government at the present time. In 1992 the High Court of Australia brought down the Mabo decision, which threw out the old terra nullius doctrine and substituted for it a recognition of the survival in certain circumstances of native title, including on the mainland of Australia. As a consequence of that, the Commonwealth Parliament enacted a Native Title Act in 1993 and at the end of last year the High Court of Australia brought down its decision in the Wik case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the government's response to the Wik decision has generated considerable opposition, not only within some sections&mdash;I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stress some sections&mdash;of the rural community of Australia, but also within the indigenous community of Australia. Can I say to the indigenous people of Australia that I understand why they are opposed to the amendments that we have put forward, but can I put to them and can I put through this parliament to the Australian people that the plan that we have devised to deal with the consequences of the Wik decision and also to deal with the unsatisfactory features of the Native Title Act is a fair and balanced plan. It is true that it does represent a significant winding back of the situation that obtained under the law immediately after the decision of the High Court in the Wik case. I do not disguise that fact. I have said before that I believed that the pendulum had swung too far and that it was necessary in the wake of the Wik decision to make a number of changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In proposing those changes, the government is not in any way suggesting that the principles of native title established by the Mabo case should be interfered with or overturned. It is worth reminding the House that the Wik decision did disappoint the expectations of many. It did run contrary to the majority view of the community after the Native Title Act was passed in 1993. The government has not opted for the blanket extinguishment route because, in our view, blanket extinguishment would involve unnecessarily expensive and protracted litigation. It could be exposed to constitutional challenge and it would in symbolic terms also be seen as a far greater affront to what the indigenous people of Australia had achieved in the native title area than other approaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that the 10&hyphen;point plan does deliver great certainty to the pastoralists and the miners of Australia. And I do not think we should be reluctant to say that, because pastoralists and miners, along with native titleholders, have rights and have interests and it is a question of achieving a fair balance. I believe that the 10&hyphen;point plan that the government has enunciated does achieve that fair and appropriate balance. That is why it is being pursued and will continue to be pursued, in the face of opposition from both sides, as a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4114"> fair and equitable outcome to a very, very difficult problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area that has been under notice is the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission into the removal of indigenous children from their families. This report, which was tabled yesterday, has understandably gone very deeply to the emotions of many people in the Australian community. I said yesterday, and I very happily repeat in this parliament today, that personally I feel a very deep sorrow for indigenous people who suffered under the injustices of policies pursued by past generations. I think all members of the House can understand the pain and trauma that many of the people who were affected by those practices might continue to suffer. Rather than reducing the quality of a nation, I think it  enhances the quality of a nation for all of us to recognise that people affected by such policies did suffer pain, did suffer injustice, do continue to be affected by it and have had their lives affected by it in a very significant way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has indicated in the submission that it made to the royal commission that it did not believe that financial compensation was appropriate. That is an issue that will be dealt with in more detail when the comprehensive response of the government is brought forward to this parliament. I said also at the reconciliation convention yesterday that I did not believe that current generations of Australians could be held accountable for or be regarded as guilty for the acts of earlier generations over which they had no control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that, as a community, we can ignore history. We must openly acknowledge the injustices of the past. As an intensely proud Australian, along, I am sure, with all other Australians who have a balanced view of the history of this country, I am immensely proud of what we have achieved over the last 200 years. I believe that the Australian achievement is something of which all of us should be proud. It has been a heroic achievement in the face of immense difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That does not gainsay the fact that there have been significant blemishes. Undoubtedly, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the most significant blemish of all in the history of this country over the last 200 years has been the treatment of our indigenous people. I would have thought that was an unarguable fact. I would have thought it was a concept that all of us could embrace, but I would have thought that we could have embraced it without developing an approach to reconciliation that looks backwards rather than forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the proper basis of reconciliation is to recognise the truth about the past, to remain proud about what this country has achieved during the years of its existence, and to resolve, united together as Australians, to work towards a better and more cooperative future. The most effective way of doing that and the most effective way in which we can honour the passage of the 1967 referendum and the wisdom of the Australian people expressed with that referendum is to commit our energy, our resources and our time to remedying those areas of continuing disadvantage amongst the most disadvantaged group within our community&mdash;the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an unusual thing, I suppose, to tack on a motion like this, but it is made necessary by virtue of the fact that there is a suggestion that the plaque ought to be placed at Old Parliament House. This I cannot fathom. I cannot fathom why that would be the intention of this parliament or the intention of this House. Does that mean that when we come to the centenary of Federation and we decide to create any plaques we will do it down at the Melbourne parliament where we all started off&mdash;that we will have a plaque at the Melbourne parliament to tell everybody what we think about the centenary of Federation? Of course any plaques or any commemorations that recognise that point will in fact be placed in this Parliament House and nowhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not know what the fate of the Old Parliament House is going to be&mdash;whether it is going to be offices, whether it is going to be a museum or whether it is going to be something else. But we do know that the lasting memorials of a political nature and those memorials that will have attention drawn to them will be the memorials placed here. I do not want to dwell on that any further. I want to get more to the substance of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister said that we ought to focus on the future and that we ought to focus upon, primarily, the physical and educational needs of the Aboriginal people. Of course we must focus on all those things. Of course those issues are central. Of course the educational and health needs of the Aboriginal population are absolutely central to the day-to-day concerns of the government. There is no question about that. We would question whether or not this government's commitment to that has been adequate, but we would not question the principle of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also symbolic issues. There are also issues which go to the sense in the Aboriginal community of their place in the Australian political system, which issues are critical as well. They are a people of nations who live by symbols. They are a people of nations who live by gestures. They are a people who are actually an extraordinarily forgiving people if the symbols are acknowledged, if the problems are acknowledged. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4116"> They will allow an issue to pass where they get that recognition because they are a people of the spirit as much as they are a people of physical nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things are therefore worth concentrating on and being concerned with as we sit down to think these issues through. They are not people to be toyed with politically in an Australian domestic context; they have been toyed with for a very long time and they do not deserve that. They are not people of substantial power in the community; they are not people to be feared. They are people to be treasured, and that is something that really ought to be reflected in the resolutions of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where did that referendum come from? That referendum back in 1967 came out of an enormous outpouring of warmth in the com munity for the responsibilities of the federal government, the responsibilities of the national parliament. It was not an invention of the Labor Party. It was not an invention, if you like, of agitators on behalf of the Aboriginal community. It was actually a referendum that came from everybody in politics and its intentions were absolutely clear-cut. Statements made at that time by the leadership of the nation make that absolutely clear. The then Deputy Leader of the Country Party said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would give the Commonwealth for the first time power to make special laws for the benefit of the Aboriginal people throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is from that statement that this motion of the government retreats. It was an absolutely clear-cut intention of the government of the day, espoused not by some people who would be associated with the so-called wet faction of the Liberal Party. The then Deputy Leader of the Country Party said that, as far as he was concerned, the purpose of the referendum was to give power to the Commonwealth to make special laws for the benefit of Aboriginal people throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were worthy campaigners for that referendum on all sides of politics, as well as some in the Aboriginal community at the time. It followed a gradual build-up before the Australian parliament of issues concerning the Aboriginal people. That included the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> presentation of that magnificent bark petition associated with the people at Yirrkala and the circumstances in which they found themselves. It included the extraordinary difficulties placed on freedom of Aboriginal movement in our communities. It included a determination on the part of the national parliament that there would be no discrimination experienced by Aboriginal people from that point on. It followed a sorry record in relation to protection of Aboriginal liberties during the very substantial portion of our history since Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That position and those views and concerns were supported by all sections of the Australian community. Ninety per cent of them voted for that referendum. Take a look at the history of federal referenda and find another one that got 90 per cent support. It was an extraordinary outpouring of concern by the people of Australia to benefit the Aboriginal community. That was what they determined&mdash;to benefit the Aboriginal community. That is the structure of law which still underpins every decision this parliament takes when it makes legislation in regard to the Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, subsequently that position was augmented. History did not stand still over that 30 years. In many ways, the hopes of the people who campaigned for that referendum have been realised. The situation we confront now is not one of total negativity. It is one of very great difficulty in the atmosphere of race relations in this country. There is no question about that, but by no means does the subsequent 30 years of history since that point of time paint a totally negative picture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Racial Discrimination Act passed through the parliament with the support of all sides. That augmented what was done and was thoroughly in keeping with the requirement on the Commonwealth to legislate for the benefit of Aboriginal people. Various land rights acts were associated with that. The Native Title Act also passed through this place. When talking about the difference between the tangible and intangible, it has to be said that every one of these, whilst having their tangible elements, is replete with symbolism. They are so treated by the Aboriginal people as they look to this parliament and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4117"> seek to draw sustenance from the attitudes and activities of the Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing has changed dramatically since that time. Whilst there were noted Aboriginal leaders such as Charles Perkins in 1967, if I gave a rollcall of the people who were actually out there advocating the Aboriginal position it would be an honoured list of names but would contain not many Aboriginals. Not very many Aboriginals would be amongst those names. Faith Bandler would be one, and that was part of the symbolism of her role in the unveiling of th plaque.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can now go down a list as long as your arm of people taking a dignified stand in favour of their people, addressing the rest of the Australian community on their behalf&mdash;Pat Dodson, Noel Pearson, Lois O'Donoghue, Gatjil Djerrkura, Marcia Langton, Colleen  Hayward, Mick Dodson, Mal Meninga, Mandawuy Yunupingu, Peter Yu, Galurrwuy Yunupingu, Wenten Rubuntja and Tracker Tilmouth. There is a whole raft of them&mdash;and that list is not meant to be exclusive, lest someone sneak up behind me and point out that I have left people off that list. The point is that many of those are household names. Many of them are better known to the Australian community than most of us who sit here in the place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an enormously important change. Why did that change come about? It came about essentially because the 1967 referendum was a recognition of political rights and status:  `You now speak for yourselves. You have a parliament to address. It is the Commonwealth parliament. You address that parliament when you have grievances, when you need to deal with the issues that affect the nation.' That is what was said in 1967. In a sense, it was a charge to the Aboriginal people by the Australian community: `Address us now. We have kept you out of political expression for a very long time. Address us now.' Of course, they have done that since that point of time and they have made quite clear the issues and concerns they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those concerns are being picked up to some extent and we are dealing with those issues in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this parliament today. We will deal with them again in relation to the stolen children. We will deal with them also when we come to considering the 10 points in relation to the Native Title Act. One thing I am looking forward to when that legislation comes into this place is an understanding of what the 10 points actually mean. An awful lot of people in the community have a lot of confidence about what those 10 points mean. I am not one of them, I must confess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can see you slotting in an interpretation on each one of those points in any particular direction you choose to go. I rather think I will see Tim Fischer come out one day and say, `There's bucket loads of extinguishment in this,' and then somebody else will address the Aboriginal community with, `All your rights are protected.' We are left to puzzle as to who is telling what, about whom, in what circumstances and when. We are entitled to be a little quizzical about that. And I suppose we will find out all about that when that particular act is tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we do know&mdash;and the government knows it, because the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) made this amply clear in his public advice to parliament before the Wik decision was handed down&mdash;if residual native title is found on pastoral leases, any attempt to extinguish that will run up against, firstly, a lack of power on the part of the Commonwealth to do so and, secondly, if the attempt is made, massive substantial compensation. Those are not my words but those of the Attorney-General in the explanatory notes that he put out to the legislation which subsequently was withdrawn to be amended in the context of Wik.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government knows what its responsibilities are and it knows the limitations on its powers. It understands that. There is no doubt in my mind that, whatever actually emerges in the legislation, there is a thoroughgoing understanding in the government's mind of how far they can go and, if they do transgress, what uncertainty will be created for the pastoralists&mdash;and certainty will be created for the Australian taxpayers if they find themselves with a piece of legislation which is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4118"> likely to be successfully challenged with massive compensation resulting from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do know this: whatever there is in the legislation, whatever might have been said to any particular group in the Australian community, the Australian government does understand what the limitations upon it are; and if it acts against them, it does so knowingly. But these will be tremendously important concerns of this parliament: the way we address both that legislation and the question of the stolen children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My time is almost up, but we will have another opportunity to debate those issues in this place. We will have an opportunity to make restitution. We will have an opportunity to state generously what we believe about the nature of race relations in this country. We will have an opportunity in that regard to make the national apology that needs to be made at that point of time for the suffering of those people who have experienced such an  extraordinary deprivation as a result of quite recent government decisions, both state and federal. We will have a chance for a bit of an outpouring of emotion in this parliament in a way in which there ought to be at that point of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us now with this motion honour the people who passed the 1967 referendum&mdash;90 per cent of the Australian people. Let us honour them. Let us honour also the people who put forward that referendum; let us honour the Aboriginal people with the passing of an appropriate resolution in this place, and not a half&hyphen;hearted one. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on this very important matter of Aboriginal reconciliation. A major step forward for the nation occurred on 27 May 1967 with the long overdue granting of full citizenship rights to indigenous people. It had been evolving for some time and had included developments that took place during 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Menzies prime ministership. Indeed, it is a source of some pride on my own part that it was a relation of mine who in many ways spearheaded that campaign&mdash;one Jessie Street.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons that it took a long time to evolve was that there were elements in our community who continued to espouse divisive and in some cases racist views, and held at bay those who had a more kindly and more rational outlook on these matters. But when, to gauge the true feelings of the Australian people, a referendum was held&mdash;as has been pointed out in this place, in fact, over the last few minutes&mdash;it emerged that there was overwhelming support, in fact in the order of 90 per cent, for the full citizenship rights for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is timely, 30 years on, to reflect upon that decision; to analyse the attitudinal and social changes that have occurred during that period; to measure where things are now; and, most importantly, to chart a positive course of action for the future. Interestingly, I believe that the attitudes of the Australian people have not changed very much over those years in this area. There is still the same level of real support for the rights and welfare of indigenous people, and there is still the same strong level of commitment for equality of opportunity. As Australians, we do indeed share a commitment for a fair go for everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are increasingly, I think, aware of, interested in and proud of the culture and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. As a unified Australian community, we must seek to rise above those who talk endlessly about the problems, without attempting to find solutions. I for one would not pretend that there are easy solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I would say that one of the first steps is for people to adopt a more visibly tolerant attitude and commitment to, if you like, becoming personally more involved in improving the situation. I do not know whether this is right, but I recently heard that some 80 per cent of Australians have never actually personally spoken to an Aboriginal.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4119">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, in my own case, I found it very interesting recently to spend a night with the rural leadership training program, which is an outstanding course for young Australians, men and women, involved in leadership in rural Australia. These particular courses&mdash;and there have been four of them now&mdash;begin with an intensive few days in the Kimberleys where people camp out and hike along difficult route marches and what have you during the days; it is pretty character building stuff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having spent a day and an evening with the last intake, I found it very interesting to discover that they had learnt an enormous amount from the Aboriginal participant on the course and from the Aboriginal guide on the course who had shown them a lot of the things that were of significance to him and his people in that outback setting. In fact, there was a fellow in his mid&hyphen;thirties from my electorate who, when I arrived on the scene, wanted to tell me that&mdash;and he said this in front of the Aboriginal participant and the Aboriginal guide&mdash;he had arrived on the  course as a bigot and was leaving as somebody who was no longer a bigot. He had found that opportunity to interact and to work alongside&mdash;even survive alongside&mdash;Aboriginal people in an environment with which they are more familiar with than we are. It was a very interesting, illuminating and moving experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To restore the dignity and self-worth of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people will require goodwill from all Australians, a spirit of cooperation, a determination to take this nation forward as a unified country which respects individual differences. We need to ensure that there is a warm spread of goodwill rather than the fuelling of ugly fires of discontent. We need respect for human dignity and the right of all people to be treated fairly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I firmly believe that the great majority of citizens want that equality, to achieve it will still require a conscious change in the hearts, minds and actions of some Australians. We need to demonstrate that good old Australian spirit of pitching in and helping in a constructive manner. The solutions start with individuals and what they are prepared to do 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> personally, especially in those urban settings in our country towns and in our major cities where some 90 per cent of modern indigenous people live. But there is an important role for government&mdash;and others have discussed this today&mdash;to provide the framework, the resources and, in some cases, the inspiration for positive change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to limit myself to some remarks about activities in my own portfolio. I am taking a number of measures to attain a greater level of involvement and participation by indigenous people. For example, I have supported the establishment of a team of Aboriginal landcare facilitators to assist in sustainable land management activity. Many people feel that, with their affinity for the land, the Aboriginal people have a special role to play there. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are currently responsible for the management of some 16 per cent of Australia's land surface and comprise a significant percentage of the population of rural and regional communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also provided support for the establishment of a pilot market garden project in Gilgandra to enable young Aboriginal people to learn the necessary horticultural skills to grow vegetables and native foods. I am providing joint support with the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in a pilot youth suicide prevention project for indigenous people in the Northern Territory, details of which will be announced at a later date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that there are many opportunities as a government to establish meaningful programs of worthwhile activities which will help give young people a sense of self&hyphen;esteem as well as a sense of pride and purpose. I believe it is absolutely essential that we assist indigenous people to become economically empowered to move towards greater self-reliance and self-sufficiency, particularly in rural and regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next week, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) and I will be jointly announcing a rural industry strategy which will help address the socioeconomic and environmental issues 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4120"> which impact on the development and sustainability of indigenous industries and enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having made those few brief remarks about where I think there has perhaps been a lack of focus on where real improvements in relationships in our communities can be achieved&mdash;that is, at the level of the local community&mdash;I give my personal commitment to continue with efforts to further create opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I represent a large rural electorate. It has the fifth highest number of indigenous people of any electorate represented in this House. I understand the problems that we face in developing better outcomes and more harmonious relationships within and between rural communities in this area of concern, where in the final analysis real improvements in relationships must take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no easy answers. There are no easy solutions. In fairness to governments of all persuasions, if there had been, we would have found more of them. I seek to reaffirm  my support and my party's support for the strongest efforts to be made to create a better future for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The passage of the 1967 referendum 30 years ago today was a defining moment in modern Australian history. It was certainly a defining moment for my generation. There was not much in the 1960s&mdash;the Vietnam War decade&mdash;that gave much hope to those of us coming of age then that the world was becoming a saner, more decent, more civilised place. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the referendum campaign, with its cross&hyphen;party support, its massive affirmative outcome and the spirit that then prevailed that we were all doing something good and decent and overdue to recognise the humanity of our fellow indigenous Australians, did give us a beacon of hope about the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The campaign, as it took place up and down the country, brought many Australians face to face with Aboriginal Australians for the first time and began, in many instances, that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> crucial process of stripping away the layer of gauze through which so many white Australians looked at their black neighbours and through which so many now still unhappily look at their Asian neighbours. Unless we start looking at each other as individual human beings, with individual human strengths and weaknesses, not as types or categories or stereotypes, we are never going to make much progress with reconciliation or, for that matter, engagement in the Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The referendum in 1967 gave hope to everyone in the country who cared about the plight of Aboriginal people, their dispossession, their annihilation in many instances, certainly their humiliation, their forced assimilation, their living conditions, the prejudice and the discrimination still existing against them, and their psychological despair. It gave everyone who despaired that the state governments of the day would ever do the right thing in response to all those hurts and humiliations a stimulus to start thinking, talking and planning about what the Commonwealth could now do on behalf of the whole nation. It made every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person in this country stand up tall and proud and confident, as they had never been entitled to before, that the future would be different. But would the future be different?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell the House the story of just one black Australian whom I came to know very closely a few years after the referendum, because it is a story about that hope. It is also a story about the reality of the Aboriginal experience in this country as it was after the referendum and, frankly, as it continues to this day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The young man's name was Brian Kamara Willis. He was born early in the 1950s somewhere in the Northern Territory&mdash;he never knew quite where&mdash;of an Aboriginal mother and a white father. He was, as the full bloods called him and as he called himself, a `yella fella'. That in-between status haunted him all his life. He was, like so many of his generation and the generations before him, a stolen child. As a very young kid, he was snatched from the arms of his mother, taken to Adel 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4121"> aide to a childhood of institutions and foster homes, to an environment in which&mdash;for reasons that ought to be very understandable if we stop for a moment to think about them&mdash;he really never settled down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in his mid&hyphen;teens the 1967 referendum was passed and, encouraged and stimulated by it, he went back to the Northern Territory, proud now of his Aboriginality, to try to rediscover his roots. When he did discover them he was shattered. He found his mother living out a desperately unhappy existence in fringe dwellers camps around Darwin. I cannot begin to describe the emotion with which Brian described to me the exhilaration of first finding his mother, and then the despair at the circumstances in which he found her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a very bright and personable kid, but this knocked the stuffing out of him. He drifted into labouring and rouseabout, knockabout jobs around the towns and the bush in the territory, and he seemed to be eventually heading down a similar path. That was, at least, until in the early 1970s&mdash;with the  Commonwealth, especially with the new government in 1972 now devoting major resources to Aboriginal policies and programs&mdash;he actually picked up a job as a field officer for the new Aboriginal Legal Service in Alice Springs, funded by the Commonwealth under its referendum powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He blossomed in a dozen different ways. His potential was recognised and it was nurtured by those around him, and he formed what would have before then seemed an absolutely unachievable and unreachable objective&mdash;the idea of himself becoming a lawyer. With the help of Aboriginal study grants he came to Melbourne to do his final year's school as university preparation. That is where I and my family came to know him, and we became very close friends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A year or so later he was admitted to Melbourne University Law School, where I was then teaching, under a Commonwealth&mdash;again, post&hyphen;referendum&mdash;disadvantaged students quota. And things for a while went very well. But eventually he began to be oppressed by the environment pressing in around him. Partly, it was physical&mdash;he and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> his young family felt hemmed in by the city and longed for space; they were desperate to get out into a countryside without fences where he could feel again some attachment, some relationship, to the land. It was with this young man that I think I first really actually understood how much the land mattered to Aboriginal people: the sense of belonging, the spiritual attachment, the sense of despair at the dispossession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The psychological pressure was also getting him down. Despite the change of atmosphere that was associated with the referendum, he and his family were still experiencing put&hyphen;downs and humiliation. There was a constant sense that he did not really belong. He had to be constantly proving more about himself, about his abilities and about his character than anyone else had to. So, in the event, he deferred the completion of his degree and went back to the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His talents and his new education were such that he in fact became, in quite a short time, the Director of the Aboriginal Legal Service. He became an outspoken champion of his people in Central Australia, speaking and writing about a whole range of policy issues&mdash;and, in particular, speaking and writing in very fierce and moving terms about the lost souls of the stolen children. In a newspaper article in 1980 he spoke of his fellow victims in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They had no sense of where they could call their home, no sense of being wanted, all traces of their families had disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must say that every human being has to have these basic elements: A sense of belonging to someone, some identifiable area you can call home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once you have got these essential things you know that love is there. They make life for a human being worth living.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So Brian Kamara Willis's life until then, although it had had its awful moments, was one of extraordinary achievement and brilliant promise, and nearly all of it was made possible by the 1967 referendum and by what followed from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the story does not have a happy ending. In the end, Brian Kamara Willis just could not fight the pressures, shrug off the prejudic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4122"> es and sustain the struggle for long enough. One night in March 1980 he went to a political gathering&mdash;as he often did&mdash;and the people there remembered him getting very distressed at one stage during the evening and saying something like, `The urban black, the part&hyphen;Aboriginal, is the man in between. He has nothing.' He went home and, at the age of 26 or 27, in front of his wife and his two young children, he took up a shotgun and blew out his brains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke of all of this, about the destruction of a brilliant young life, in the Senate back in 1980 when it all happened. The memory of that young man and his family and what happened to them haunts me still.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that for all the hopes that were raised by the 1967 referendum, all that has happened since, for all the years that have passed since, things are now not so very different. There are still justices unredressed and young lives being tragically wasted, and there is still a lack of understanding&mdash;by too many people in too many decision&hyphen;making positions in this  country&mdash;of the nature of the problem and what needs to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can we still be arguing now, in 1997, as we are today, whether the referendum was really designed to benefit Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people? Does the government really want to stand up now and say that the referendum was to allow the passage of legislation to hurt and discriminate against our Aboriginal people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can we still be arguing now in 1997 about the need to focus not just on the so&hyphen;called practical measures&mdash;important as they are&mdash;and not as well on the means to address to the extent now possible the deprivation of life and liberty and property and dignity which so many indigenous people have suffered through so much of our nation's history?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can we still be arguing now, as we are today with this motion, whether or not we, as a parliament and as a nation, should apologise for what went wrong in the past? Mr Deputy Speaker, that we are arguing about these things on this commemoration day 30 years 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> after the referendum shows just how far we still have to go as a nation in recognising the reality of life as it still now is for so many of our indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It shows how important it is on this day that we pass a motion in this parliament&mdash;amended in the way that we propose&mdash;which looks both backward to the hurts of the past and the achievements of 1967 in addressing them, and forward to what remains to be done; which states very clearly everything that has to be done and the Commonwealth's responsibility in doing it; which expresses some genuine affection and understanding about the humanity of our fellow indigenous Australians and some understanding of the enormity of the wrongs done to them; and which is expressed, Mr Deputy Speaker, in terms which all of us can not only endorse, but of which we can be proud.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thirty years ago today, two referenda proposals were put to the Australian people. The first was to break the nexus between the numbers in the House of Representatives and the Senate. That proposal was defeated. The second contained two proposals: one relating to section 51 of the constitution and the other relating to section 127. Section 51 of the constitution prevented the Commonwealth from making a law for the benefit of Aboriginal people. Section 127 related to the counting of people and said that Aboriginal people should not be included. Of themselves, they were not remarkable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look back to the original framing of the constitution, to the four debates in 1890, 1891, 1897 and 1898, it is extraordinary that when section 51 of the constitution was debated, on not a single occasion were Aboriginal people mentioned. When section 127 was debated, on only a few occasions were Aboriginal people mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Events develop their own mythology but, in spite of the first referendum proposal being defeated, these two were passed with the highest majority in the country's history. In my own state of Victoria, it was 95 per cent; in the state with the least support, Western Australia, it was still 80 per cent. The Elec 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4123"> toral Commission did not send out a no case; they only sent out a yes case. When asked why, they replied, `We've yet to learn of any opposition to the Aboriginal proposal that exists from any quarter.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why are we here talking about it 30 years later? Perhaps it has more to do with the comments made at the time by Faith Bandler, whose name appears in this motion. Her comments were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Aborigines, an overwhelming yes vote can mean a new life of hope. When you write yes in the lower square of your ballot paper, you are holding out the hand of friendship and wiping out 200 years of injustice and inhumanity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only the federal government has the money and so by voting yes you give the responsibility to the national parliament and make possible a program of real equal rights and equal opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What 1967 was about was hope. There is a great deal of feeling and an enormous range of opinions across this parliament and across the Australian community. I cannot pretend to have known anything about Aboriginal affairs prior to March 1990 when I was asked to be  shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. Within half an hour of being offered that appointment, I got a phone call from Fred Chaney, who was, and remains, a friend. He said to me, `Congratulations. It's a wonderful job. It will change you.' There is no doubt that having to confront such great poverty and such great injustice, for someone like me, over the next three years, did change me. But it is an experience that not many Australians have and, in the end, different Australians hold different views through the different experiences they have had and the different degree to which they have had to approach or confront the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) talked about symbolism. I can put another item of symbolism. It was in 1990, when we discussed the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill, when I stood on the other side of the chamber and the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs stood where I am and, at the end of a very difficult nine&hyphen;month debate, we leaned across this table and shook hands&mdash;the only time in this House that that has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> happened. We shook hands because we had been able to come to a joint position. It was not easy, but the parliament spoke with one voice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition talked about honouring the people of 1967. We would honour them much more if we had the capacity in this place not to be as divided as we are today, but to actually speak with one voice. This debate makes me incredibly sad because to me the message of 1967 was that real change can be achieved if the country or the parliament works for a common position. Clearly, the opposition believes there is a high moral ground to be obtained by not seeking that common position. I believe their views to be genuine but, nonetheless, it causes me immense sadness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirty years ago, this country faced far more than a referendum. It faced far more than simply putting Aboriginal people on the census. It faced the question of whether the Commonwealth would have the constitutional responsibility to make laws for Aboriginal people and, in doing so, gave Aboriginal people a place in society. The voices of the likes of Charles Perkins and Faith Bandler showed, for the first time, Aboriginal people taking a key voice in the future that faced them. That referendum was about hope, about whether health, education and job prospects would in any way be better in the future than they were at the time. Today, I am ashamed to say that the hopes of many of those people who voted in the 1967 referendum are dashed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are good things happening in Aboriginal affairs. In 1972, there were only 75 Aborigines in higher education; today there are 7,000. In 1972, the rate of childhood mortality in Aboriginal kids was 10 times that of the general population; today in the Northern Territory, it is three times&mdash;a dramatic change, but still a long way to go. Yet there are still a strident few who say that Aboriginal people are the beneficiaries of reverse racism; who would say Aborigines enjoy privileges over other Australians. That view appals me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difference with Aboriginal people is they have suffered systematic discrimination 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4124"> at the hands of government. Had I been an Aboriginal kid born of a half&hyphen;caste mother in New South Wales in 1956 I probably would not have attended primary school because of statutes passed by the state government. Until the early 1960s Aboriginal people could not marry or own a bank account in the Northern Territory without permission. Until 1968 Aboriginal children were still being forcibly removed from their parents in Western Australia. Until the early 1970s Aboriginal people in Queensland had their movements restricted and needed what was effectively a passport to leave a reserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have given a talk on legal discrimination against Aboriginal people on a number of occasions and on each occasion I have had the same thing happen. There is a small group of people waiting to see me as I leave and they say, `We are from South Africa and we never did all those things.' But that is what can happen when there is such a minority that is hidden from most of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very easy, with hindsight, to say things were wrong. It is very easy to talk of words. Clearly what happened to the children who were removed from their families was  wrong&mdash;deeply, horribly, morally wrong. Taking children away from their parents is wrong. Placing them in institutions, denying them the truth about their past and denying them access to information about their parents, is wrong&mdash;deeply, horribly, morally wrong. But we say that from the perspective of today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the people who administered that policy was Paul Hasluck, a man whom I admire immensely. Before he died I had the opportunity to discuss it with him. Of course, at the time, it was done with the best intentions. It was done by people like Paul Hasluck who were actually trying to do something at a time when the majority of Australians did not give a damn, when the view was that the Aboriginal people were still going to die out as a race. It was done by thousands of decent Christian people who took Aboriginal kids into their home thinking they were giving them something better for the future. No&hyphen;one could imagine the consequences that would follow.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course it not only struck at the core of Aboriginal communities, in the end it diminished all Australians. The debate of recent times has led to quite an outpouring of emotion around the country. The letters pages of the newspapers show this very clearly. There was a letter that moved me immensely in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> over the weekend; the story of a crying policeman. The person was talking of his father who was the duty policeman at Echuca from 1922 to 1946. His father would often come home and cry, sobbing like a child, sitting at the front of the house. When his son asked him what the problem was, his father said he would tell him when he grew up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The letter said that on a camping trip, when this kid was 16, he asked his father if he would tell him the reason he cried. His father told him that when he went out on duty on those mornings his sergeant would order him to accompany two welfare officers to the Aboriginal mission station to give them bodily protection when they entered nice, clean simple homes of half&hyphen;caste people and bodily removed nine&hyphen;, 10&hyphen;, 11&hyphen; and 12&hyphen;year&hyphen;old children from their loving mothers and fathers to commandeered taxis. They were taken away to the far reaches of New South Wales and Queensland. They were farmed out to the service of wealthy businessmen and graziers. No doubt a few were treated well. That was the reason his father cried on those days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end those acts diminish us all. It should not have happened. It obviously must never happen again. But I have had the perspective to think and talk and care about this for seven years and I have decided words are cheap. We can pass motions. We can have all good intentions. But if you actually look today in my area of health, there is no evidence of any improvement whatsoever in the last decade. In fact, in many areas things have gone backwards, or they have remained static for the Aboriginal population where things have improved for the rest of the population. So the gap has actually widened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Words are cheap. Motions are cheap. What is required is a generosity of spirit. The message from the 1967 referendum is that things can be achieved with bipartisanship. I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4125"> will not debate one by one the amendments put up by the Labor Party. I will merely point out that the Native Title Act of 1993 clearly had elements in it that were to the detriment of Aboriginal people, such as making available extinguishment of native title under certain conditions; allowing compulsory acquisition and validation of past acts that were made invalid because of native title. What we are facing with the Wik decision is no different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want my successor as health minister to stand here in 30 years time and say to Australians that the original Australians still suffer disadvantage in health, education and employment. The changes are not going to come about through motions. They are not going to come about through words. They are going to come about through governments having the generosity of spirit to allow Aboriginal people to make their own mistakes. They are going to come about by taking a clear focus on the future, not a focus on the past. They are going to come about by us being able to achieve things that are achievable, not promising the unachievable. I do not want more words. I do not have more time for  the past. But I do, very much, want a new direction for the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The wording of this motion has already been subject to some controversy and I will address individually each of the five points made in it. Before I do I want to make it clear that, though I think this motion represents a series of symbolic political platitudes that do not make a lot of real difference to the plight of Aboriginal people, they do not help reconciliation at all. I am determined that the Labor Party should not prevail by preparing an even more useless motion&mdash;mouthing all the things that they think are politically correct and that privileged social elites want to hear&mdash;that totally ignores that for the last 13 years Labor was in control.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "paragraphs" (first occurring) be omitted with a view to substituting the following: </PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The first point of the original motion recognises that this is the 30th anniversary of the referendum that changed the constitution and gave the Commonwealth the power to make special laws. This referendum took place in an environment where Aboriginal people were not recognised as people and suffered terribly from illness, disease and neglect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The referendum put to the people addressed two things: it enabled Aboriginal people to be counted in reckoning Australia's population, and it gave the Commonwealth government the power to make laws for Aboriginal people in the states, concurrently with state governments. I do not think that any person in this country would not recognise that these were important and necessary things that needed to be done. We wanted to bring the Aboriginal people on board as equals. The problem is not with this but rather with what has actually happened since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point in the original motion reaffirms the support for the outcome of the referendum, which was overwhelmingly supported by the people. But I do not think that people in Australia should be happy with the situation for some Aborigines in Australia today. Rather, we should be looking at what went wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reality, we gave the Commonwealth powers to do things through a referendum, and it failed. I have been accused of being a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4126"> racist and hating Aborigines. Neither of these things are true. The real racist act in Australia has been to pretend that things were going to change by amending the constitution and then letting them get worse. But things are not worse for everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been accused of saying that Aborigines are not disadvantaged. That is clearly nonsense. Some Aborigines are extremely disadvantaged and need help, but there are some others doing very well. Despite this, all Aborigines are treated the same in many aspects of Commonwealth support and legislation. Why do we persist? This approach has failed. Australians, whether Aboriginal or not, know this is true. We must change the way we do things before things can get better. In view of this, I wish to amend this portion of the motion to read that we reaffirm the spirit of the outcome of the referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point of this motion asks us to recognise the need for legislative and other powers of the Commonwealth to deal separately with problems facing Aborigines as if they live in a vacuum. This is wrong. It is a recipe for more of the same failed policies. Governments have interpreted the results of  the 1967 referendum to mean that we should separate Aborigines from mainstream Australia in order to solve the problem that they face. We have been travelling down that road for 30 years and invested billions of dollars to find that many of the measures used to rate our performance show that we have made it worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By deliberately isolating one group of Australians from the mainstream, governments have increased the difficulty that they will face in overcoming the long-term problems that are before them. Many people in this country want a change in direction. We need to overcome the problems faced by all minority groups in Australia, but the biggest facing us relate to Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look around me in this chamber at so many of the members who have accused me of being a racist because I have questioned the approach taken by this and previous governments to Aborigines in this country. I am struck by the thought that the real problem can be found amongst the people who have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sat in this place year after year since 1967 and achieved so little. They have thrown money at the problem in the hope that it will go away, and we have seen precious little for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to solve any problem, those facing it must be involved in the solution. You cannot do that if you give them power on one hand and take away responsibility for the outcomes with the other. For too long ATSIC has been a power unto itself and the programs it delivered unaccounted for. Enormous amounts of money have been spent without true accountability. There has been no looking at outcomes to make sure that failure was not repeated. Many Australians feel cheated by the money wasted over the years by ATSIC, and I understand this frustration. ATSIC has failed as a product of Commonwealth legislation and needs to be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indigenous Australians need to be brought back into the mainstream so that their problems can be dealt with on a needs basis. They should be protected from bureaucratic failure to the same extent that other Australians are. The social security, health and employment services in this country are far from perfect, but they offer better services integrated into the rest of the community than ATSIC. Their outcomes are far more accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot afford to continue down a path that costs such a fortune to achieve so little. This is why I want to amend the original motion to have all people, including Aborigines, helped on a basis of need. Aborigines will not be worse off because of this. They will actually get the improvement that they thought would come from the 1967 referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth part of the original motion acknowledges that some terrible things were done in the past and I, like many Australians, am sorry for the fact that they occurred. This does not mean, however, that I am in some way responsible for what has happened, and I resent being made to feel guilty for something I did not do. What I want to be responsible for, however, is fixing the way we deal with Aboriginal issues today.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his speech, the Prime Minister says the motivation for the 1967 referendum was for the benefit of the Aboriginal race. The Prime  Minister says that the spirit of the 1967 referendum was to remedy disadvantage. Yet the basis of the 10-point plan, the basis of the response to Wik, is disadvantage to the Aboriginal race. It discriminates against the Aboriginal race. That is why the Prime Minister's 10-point plan is wrong. That is why the Prime Minister's 10-point plan is vulnerable to a successful constitutional challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1967 referendum changed the race power for all time. When the 1967 referendum bill went through the parliament, the intent, the purpose, of the bill when it was put to the people was one of a beneficial power for the advantage of the Aboriginal race. There was no `no case'. The Prime Minister Harold Holt said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the proposals relating to Aboriginals are approved by the people, the Government would regard it as desirable to hold discussions with the States to secure the widest 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> measure of agreement with respect to Aboriginal advancement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The then Leader of the Opposition, Gough Whitlam, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that with the excision of the words from paragraph (xxvi) of section 51 the members of this Parliament will be able for the first time to do something for Aboriginals&mdash;Aboriginals representing the greatest pockets of poverty and disease in this country.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the advantages of repealing the paragraph (xxvi) words will be that the Commonwealth will be able to assist those very extensive States&mdash;the three largest States in Australia&mdash;which have not the financial resources to deal with this problem. The Commonwealth can at least bring the resources of the whole nation to bear in favour of the Aboriginals where they live.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Wentworth, the member for Mackellar, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some people say&mdash;I think wrongly&mdash;that no discrimination is necessary in regard to the Aboriginal people. I think that some discrimination is necessary. But I think it should be favourable, not unfavourable.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Bryant, the member for Wills, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then we as a Parliament and as individual members must take up the challenge on behalf of the Aboriginal people and recover the last 180 years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the House of Representatives, Mr Beazley Snr, the member for Fremantle, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth should have this power because it is the Government which is confronted with the conscience of the world on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the Senate, Senator Murphy said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this proposed law there is no suggestion of any intended discrimination in respect of Aboriginals except a discrimination in their favour.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet this government will not accept the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). Paragraph (3) of the amendment says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">recognises, as was made abundantly clear by the political leaders of the time, that the referendum was passed with the intent that the power conferred on the Commonwealth only be used for the benefit of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4128"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When the yes case went to the people, it was a yes case only, not a no case. This is what the case for yes said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purposes of these proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Constitution are to remove any ground for the belief that, as at present worded, the Constitution discriminates in some ways against people of the Aboriginal race, and, at the same time, to make it possible for the Commonwealth Parliament to make special laws for the people of the Aboriginal race, wherever they may live, if the Commonwealth Parliament considers this desirable or necessary.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's object will be to co&hyphen;operate with the States to ensure that together we act in the best interests of the Aboriginal people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was what was distributed in the yes case, countersigned by the then Prime Minister, Harold Holt; the Deputy Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. John McEwen; and the Leader of the Opposition, Gough Whitlam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The leaders also contributed to a journal called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Smoke Signals</EMPHASIS>, the official organ of the Aborigines Advancement League of Victoria. The Prime Minister, Harold Holt, said in that journal in May 1967:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot allow it to be said that our Federal Constitution discriminates against some people who live within our shores&mdash;the Aborigines. Nor is it, we believe, acceptable to the Australian people as a whole that the National Parliament should not have power to make special laws for the people of the Aboriginal race, where that is in their best interests.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You had the then Leader of the Opposition, Gough Whitlam, saying:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . words which can be read as discriminating against the Aboriginal race will be removed. This would give the Commonwealth Government, for the first time, power to make special laws for the benefit of the Aboriginal people throughout Australia. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was a beneficial power. The Prime Minister is not above the law. The government is not above the law. The 10&hyphen;point plan will not work. It has got constitutional problems. Today there was a writ lodged in the High Court of Australia challenging a bill that passed through this parliament in the last fortnight and that writ, if it is accepted by the High Court, will present an opportunity for the High Court once and for all to determine the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this Prime Minister, in his speech today, says, `Our native title amendments, the plans we have devised, are a fair and balanced plan.' They are not. They are all detrimental to the Aboriginal race. He concedes it is a significant winding back after the decision in Wik. I agree with that, and that is why the Prime Minister is not on solid constitutional ground. He ignores the spirit and purpose of the 1967 referendum. That is why the government will not accept our amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another part of our amendment that they will not accept relates to the plaque. The plaque that was unveiled today is a recognition&mdash;it is the 30th anniversary&mdash;a celebration, of the 1967 referendum. In the Old Parliament House, the bark petition was tabled. It is now housed in the new Parliament House. In the Old Parliament House the Australia Act was passed. It is now housed in the new Parliament House. This plaque commemorating the 30th anniversary should be housed in the new Parliament House. We do not want to go back; we want to go forward. It is a reaffirmation by this parliament. That is why the Prime Minister's words are weasel words. He has got a problem. He is not above the law. He cannot discriminate; nor can his government. That is why the High Court will intervene, as its constitutional authority requires it to do. Its power is to lay down the common law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I had the good fortune to listen to the current Governor&hyphen;General, Sir William Deane, who gave an occasional address at the Australian Reconciliation Convention. This is what he&mdash;a former justice of the High Court&mdash;had to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4129">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the effect of the exclusion of "the Aboriginal race in any State" in s.51(xxvi) had been, while it remained, to prevent the enactment, under any of the heads of Commonwealth power, of a law which could properly be characterised as a law with respect to the Aboriginal race in any State. That meant that, while the exclusion remained, the Commonwealth lacked legislative power to make any law designed for the special benefit of the Aboriginal people in any of the States. In contrast&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and here is the punch line&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">once the exclusion was deleted, the Commonwealth, under s.51(xxvi), possessed plenary legislative power to make any special laws which it deemed necessary for the welfare of the Aboriginal peoples.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is from the current Governor&hyphen;General. And that is why this Prime Minister is behaving like a constitutional vandal. That is why he will not accept our amendments. The debate after Wik was the prejudiced leading the blind. The debate now has been transformed into the blind leading the prejudiced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the opposition amendments to the parliament. They need to be picked up because they are a reaffirmation of what the parliament and the people intended in the 1967 referendum that was overwhelmingly endorsed by over 90 per cent of the Australian population.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is an important time in which this particular MPI has been proposed. It was proposed even prior to the release today of the Yellow Pages Small Business Index. It was proposed because the small business sector has been promised so much by this government, but this government has failed to deliver. This is a government that suffers from weak and indecisive leadership. It is a government which is directionless, and it is also a government where the Prime Minister 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (Mr Howard) parades himself as the self-styled high priest of small business. He leaves it to his Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) to parade himself as the acolyte that is going to deliver the holy writ, and that holy writ is going to be the salvation of small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simply, the coalition when in opposition went to the people of this country and said, `Small business is where it is at. Small business is going to be the salvation economically of this country and we are going to deliver in spades.' They released their policy called `A new deal for small business'. Actually, it is a raw deal for small business. What they did was raise expectations and then deliver nothing. They are a government which delivers simply wishy washy rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of examples that spring immediately to mind. What happened when this minister took over? I accept the fact that in opposition he was the spokesperson on finance and they shuffled him into small business and said, `Geoff, you go and deliver the goods that we promised in the last election campaign.' What did he do? He failed the fund and therefore had shut down the Franchising Code Council&mdash;immediately: gone. Franchising is one of the fastest growing areas of small business in this country. It needs protection and it needs codes in place to look after those people who enter into relationships with franchisors. They promised a 50 per cent reduction in the burden of red tape and to eliminate compliance costs. What has been delivered? Exactly the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having been elected to government with the overwhelming support of the small business constituency of this country, there was an expectation that there would be something delivered. So what did the government do? They promised that they would have a committee of inquiry into the needs of small business. So the Bell committee was established. The Bell committee was established under the chairmanship of Charlie Bell, the head of the McDonald's organisation in this country, probably the largest franchisor in Australia. He was going to oversee a committee inquiry into the needs of franchisees and other small businesses in this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4131">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, is it not, that immediately after that decision was taken, the Australian Certified Practising Accountants Association came out and said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph</EMPHASIS> on 5 May year that this was nothing more than a government of committees. And well it is. The comment made this year could have applied equally last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal reason for commissioning this report was to reduce compliance costs and red tape. It dodged tax reform and in fact the Prime Minister went out of his way to say that we would not have any tax reform considered as part of that Bell committee inquiry. What did they do? Well, not a great deal. At the end of the day, 62 recommendations were brought down by Mr Bell. His report was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for business</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage we then saw the 1996&hyphen;97 budget intervene. What did we see small business get out of it? The export market development grants scheme was announced as a positive improvement for the tourist industry, but they reduced the amount of money that was going to be available. In the area of R&amp;D, the 150 per cent tax concession was cut to 125 per cent, and something like $2 billion was cut out of R&amp;D. Yet they said, `We will  look after small business, because what we are saying is that small business is the engine room of Australia. But at the end of the day we are not going to provide you with the wherewithal to carry on and develop that engine that is going to drive the economy forward.' We then saw the government come forward and make its substantive attack on small business standards and we saw it looking at ways to try to improve them by bringing down the Prime Minister's own statement called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS>, which was handed down on 24 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is illuminating to quote from that document. In the section on the economic importance of small business, the Prime Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business is the key to employment growth. In the decade to 1994-95&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and I ask my colleagues to reflect on who was in government in that decade&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the small business sector accounted for almost all of the one million net increase in jobs, increasing its work force by an estimated 1.1 million compared to 270,000 for large business and a decline in public sector employment of 150,000.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, under the Labor government's stewardship, small business led the way in employment growth. We have seen nothing like that since this government came to power in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Prime Minister promise small business in this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS> report? The small business innovation fund&mdash;after they cut $2 billion out of R&amp;D&mdash;was cobbled together in the Prime Minister's office because there was nothing else he was going to agree to. When you read this response to Charlie Bell, all you see is a call for more inquiries and more committees to be established. They say, `We agree in principle with the recommendations but we are not going to do anything about it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No wonder it was considered to be a damp squib when somebody in the PM's office was putting it together and they suddenly said, `We need to have something that has a bit of shock value. What we will do is call something a small business innovation fund. We will throw $130 million at it. We will say that the industry has to match it, but don't tell anybody we cut $2 billion out of R&amp;D and don't highlight the fact that it will only go to 100 firms in six categories and most of those in high-tech innovation&mdash;forget the rest&mdash;and this is going to solve the R&amp;D problem in Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then had a couple of other issues&mdash;capital gains tax, which we have agreed with, and the fringe benefits tax, which we have said was a small concession. It is terrific that small business people now need not pay fringe benefits tax when they get a taxi to work. That is the extent to which the Prime Minister thought the fringe benefits tax needed reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course there was the matter of the unfair dismissal laws. Out of the blue the Prime Minister suddenly said, `My unfair dismissal laws aren't any good anymore. My industrial relations laws that have been in place for five minutes are pretty ordinary and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4132"> we are going to have to change them. We will change our own laws and exempt small business for 12 months under the unfair dismissal provisions.' In other words, they have removed protection from workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because that went over like a lead balloon the Prime Minister decided to extend that to all small businesses and now potentially 1.3 million workers will not be covered by the industrial relations laws to protect them in their jobs. Yet this Prime Minister said, `We are going to protect jobs and we are going to create jobs through the small business sector.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was the 1997-98 budget. I know today we have had to remind the government that they brought a budget down two weeks ago.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When was that?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When was it? I cannot remember. It was two weeks today. Did it promise anything? Yes, it did. The core promise of John Howard, Prime Minister, doyen of small business, was that they would reduce compliance costs and red tape. What did the 1997-98 budget do? Small businesses have to offer each employee the choice of five superannuation funds. They have to give them some statement on each of those funds. Then they have to be a financial adviser to  them and tell them which one to go into therefore opening up the potential for them to be sued as an employer if those investments go wrong. The paperwork burden has been increased because they have to collect potentially from each employee their contributions to five funds. I ask the Prime Minister: does that make a lot of sense in cutting red tape and compliance costs? I think it does not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was the other rort about the withholding tax. That is going to give a benefit of $330 million to this government in its second year of operation. This was supposed to be a benefit. They said to small business, `Don't send in your withholding tax on a monthly basis. Do it every three months.' Small business is supposed to say, `That is a great idea. Why didn't I think of that?' Is it going to cost them anything? Yes, it will cost them time and effort because they will have to devote more time to filling in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their forms every three months but the government&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;gets a $330 million windfall in year two of this operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to reflect on what some people&mdash;not I&mdash;have suggested about this government in its approach to small business. The superannuation spokesman from the Institute of Accountants, Robert Brown, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to introduce a choice of five superannuation funds for employees would overwhelm small businesses with an implosion of paperwork.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Combine this with the massive administration costs involved with the superannuation surcharge and you have almost an impossible situation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A range of other comments were made by people in the industry itself about what this government has done for small business and how well it has gone. I thought probably the Chief Executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, Robert Bastian, got it right after the 1997&hyphen;98 budget. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this is a steady as she goes fiscally responsible budget, unfortunately in terms of employment the ship we are on is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There continues to be no incentive for small business to employ. This is not a small business budget. It has been dramatically oversold and its few positives for small employers are far outweighed by an incredible sense of disappointment.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LATHAM" NAMEID="K26">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr Latham</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who said that?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was Rob Bastian, the spokesperson on small business, who is well quoted. Today saw the release of the Yellow Pages Small Business Index. As I reminded the Prime Minister in question time today, it found that small business confidence had reached its lowest level since August 1993. Eighty per cent of small business saw the economy as being in recession or at a standstill. It went on to say that only 22 per cent of people who were aware of the government's proposals to fix small business thought that it would improve their position and less than 10 per cent of all small businesses believed the initiatives would improve the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4133">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in question time today, there is an answer for you people in government now. You are on the treasury benches and there is an answer. That answer is to adopt the recommendations of the fair trading inquiry report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS>, unanimously supported by even people on your side of the parliament in respect of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations contained in this report, whether they go to the issues of a uniform retail tenancy code, the misuse of market power on franchising or legislative protection against unfair conduct, are dealt with in the Beazley private member's bill, which lies on the table in this place, waiting to be brought on. This, Minister, is what small business wants. It wants codes underpinned by legislation. Your own backbenchers who conducted this inquiry said that that was what is required. Yet you said today in question time, `I'll get back to you in three months with a response as to what the government is going to do.' Minister, that is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Tuesday night I was at a meeting in Melbourne. There were 1,000 angry retailers down there and their complaints all went to unconscionable conduct, to landlords having market power over them and to the fact that there was no franchising council in existence any longer. They pointed out in no uncertain terms to the Victorian small business minister that she needs to lift her game. Nationally, they pointed out that your government needs to lift its game as well. They overwhelmingly endorsed the fact that recommendations foreshadowed in the media and contained in this fair trading inquiry report need to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you have the opportunity this afternoon, late in the day as it might be, not to look at that small business index and go back in history&mdash;because, mate, you're the government now&mdash;</PARA>

In the 12 months since you have been in government, since you have been the minister, support for small business has gone through the floor. You have lost it, and you have lost them because you are not delivering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You stand up here, as does the Prime Minister, and spout nothing but rhetoric and say that you understand what small business needs. What small business needs is for this fair trading inquiry report to be adopted in full. It needs for the principles I enunciated recently on behalf of the opposition to be incorporated in that. It needs, as a first step, for the Kim Beazley private member's bill to be enacted as a matter of urgency. You don't even have to turn your brain to trying to think up a bill. It is there. It is the Beazley bill about unfair conduct and the minister should adopt it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to lay to rest the opposition's concerns in regard to small business. I particularly take this opportunity to outline to the people of Australia the achievements of this government in regard to small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is trying to say that we have not been addressing the concerns of small business. That is quite contrary to, and a long way from, the truth. In fact, I will take a little time to outline the initiatives we have taken in regard to small business since coming to government. If you look at our policy focuses, particularly on coming to government and in the lead&hyphen;up to the election, you see that the important focus was a stable microeconomic climate for small business, industrial relations reform, changes to the tax system, a fair marketplace for small business and consumers, and the reduction of the compliance burden for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to a stable economic climate for small business, I remind the Labor opposition of what they did to small business. There is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4134"> a legacy from the $10.3 billion budget deficit. This government has managed to turn a $10.3 billion budget deficit into a $1.6 billion budget surplus and will repay $5 billion worth of Commonwealth debt next year. That will be the first time in a decade the Commonwealth government has not borrowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the legacy of the previous government? Seventy billion dollars was borrowed, not for small business or ports or for any other infrastructure that would give our businesses the competitive edge but to try to fund the bottom line. It was wasted. It did not go to any initiatives. Small business paid a very high price in interest rates. As I said, this is the first time we have not borrowed. You clocked up $70 billion in just five years. We have turned a $10.3 billion budget deficit into a $1.6 billion budget surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reward for small business is the lowest interest rates in 25&hyphen;odd years. There have been three falls in interest rates during our term in government. They are now two per cent lower.</PARA>

Small businesses, with loading, were paying 24 and 25 per cent interest. No wonder they felt lost. They were neglected by  you. You squeezed them. They went broke under you. You did not understand them. This government has provided a climate in which small business can expand, grow and have more certainty. This government understands small business. I acknowledge that things have been very difficult for them. The economy has been patchy in parts for them. We are out there listening to their concerns, to ensure that we turn that around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at our policy initiatives set out during the election campaign in the document `A new deal for small business'. That policy spoke of achieving, within 100 days of our coming to office: the setting up of the deregulation task force, mentioned just a moment ago; a small business summit, which we have had; and the setting up of the microbusiness 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consultative group. We said we would do it, and we delivered. We also said that we would set up the regulatory efficiency area, particularly in microbusiness.

We went a long way further than that report recommended, particularly in the areas of red tape and compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, let us look for a moment at what the previous government did. They had a report. Do you remember it? The Beddall report.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did we propose to do? In our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS> we proposed, and are sticking to, a 50 per cent cut in red tape. As a former business person myself, I know the frustration of red tape and filling out compliance forms. Looking back over the course of just the last 12 years, what did I as a businessman have to comply with? Capital gains tax: they brought it in; fringe benefits tax: they brought it in; unfair dismissal laws: they brought them in; the super guarantee: they brought it in.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4135">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the sorts of things that small business now has to comply with that it did not have to comply with. They are the sorts of things we are trying to make simpler for them. We are trying to remove the burden of that sort of thing from small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned capital gains tax. In our policy document there was reference to capital gains tax. In fact, we offered a capital gains tax rollover provision. What of the Beddall report? They brought it in on 19 September 1985. They said, `Oh, we might do something about this.' One million bucks is what they said. Did they ever do anything about it? No, they did nothing. We come in: $5 million every five years; remove the `like kind' business test, making it for all business, whatever you want to do; and, of course, our retirement package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small businesses build up their businesses as a retirement nest egg&mdash;and that is something the Labor opposition have never understood. Under our proposal: build up your business and retire at age 55 and above; each partner can take $500,000 capital gains tax free&mdash;$1 million capital gains tax free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder that the industry organisations describe our package in such glowing terms. In particular, Robert Gottliebsen in the BRW said, `The small business capital gains tax rollover is the most significant change ever made to taxation in Australia for decades'&mdash;and quite right he was. So capital gains tax is another major factor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do not really want me to talk about unfair dismissal laws. That is probably why the interjections came at that point. They, in fact, do not want to talk about unfair dismissal laws. We offered&mdash;in fact, we wanted&mdash;to remove the compliance of unfair dismissal for small businesses of 15 employees and below&mdash;and who announced that they would oppose it? These guys. They do not understand small business. They do not understand that the greatest concern to small business was, of course, the unworkable unfair dismissal laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the other initiatives: the retirement savings, the micro-business consultative group that we have set up, access to capital. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) briefly mentioned in a derogatory manner the small business innovation fund. That is something that has been missing in the Australian small business sector for all too long. They have not understood that, for most small business, you can only grow effectively with debt financing. Your ability to grow gets to the point of servicing your debt, plus retained earnings. You have not had the vehicle through an equity market. What we have done with the small business innovation fund, in particular, is put that in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly disappointed that the opposition has not recognised the things that are important to small business. But as they now after 13 years have discovered small business, let us look at what they are proposing. I noted with interest in the 24 February report in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> headed `Labor reviews party platform' that they had 15 points&mdash;15 important platforms. I thought, `This is interesting; small business is bound to be at the top of the list.' Was small business at the top of the list? Was small business even on their list? Small business was not even on the list.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RI4">Mr PROSSER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is there now. The shadow minister says, `It's there now.' He has come up now with seven points: small business policy principles&mdash;they are so wishy-washy. They are talking about growth in the economy. Wow, what they did to small business and growth in the economy! I have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4136"> to tell the shadow spokesperson that he has a long way to go if he thinks that those sorts of things are what small businesses want.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small businesses want government off their back. The interesting thing is that a moment ago the former minister was in here, and he reported that what small businesses want is government off their back. We are delivering that, particularly with regard to red tape and compliance reforms. What he does not realise is that small businesses do not want the uncertainty of massive swings in interest rates that were the ploy particularly of their policies. What small businesses want is some certainty with regard to their business decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned briefly the Beddall report. Quite frankly, why it gathered dust was because they did not deliver. They did not deliver on capital gains tax. All they could come up with in the red tape and compliance area was to have extra forms in boxes, thinking that would solve the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think, more importantly, we should go to what the industry sector is saying. My colleague did say, `This is what the industry organisations are saying.' I have mentioned the BRW. Of course, in describing our capital gains tax rollover provision, the BRW said, `Tax breaks give small business room to move.' And, `Fruit is on the tree, take the advantage; make decisions in regard to business planning now.' In relation to growth and conditions, VECCI says, `Long awaited responses to deregulation report is worth the wait.' Its following media release says,  `Government response delivers for small business.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Business Chamber says, `The small business report is a significant booster.' The real estate sector says, `Government response shows strong sensitivity to the pressures facing small business.' The opposition does not like hearing this at all. The Institute of Chartered Accountants said&mdash;and, from memory, my colleague mentioned something about this area&mdash;`For the first time in many years the small business community has a government that has shown it is prepared to listen and make changes.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder that they say that. After 13 years of being ignored, they now have a government that is prepared to listen and make changes. The institute went on to say, `In its first term of office, the government has demonstrated a commitment to encouraging and assisting small and medium sized enterprises rarely witnessed in modern times.' The opposition does not like that because we recognise the importance of small business.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After that complacent and self-satisfied performance from the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), I feel compelled to relay to the House that, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>  on 2 May, the minister for small business, when attempting to sell his government's small business message, conceived a series of pep talks and breakfasts in capital cities. He dispatched no fewer than 3,000 invitations. By late 1 May&mdash;the day before&mdash;the Sydney breakfast had attracted a total of 30 RSVPs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Stung by the poor response, Minister Prosser ordered the Sydney branch of his department&mdash;all 15 of them&mdash;to attend the function to help boost the numbers. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> referred to him as the minister for small turnouts. I have to admit that the minister's performance made me feel a whole lot better, because some of my fundraising efforts have been less than stunning successes&mdash;but just 30, oh dear!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small businesses are very busy, as we all know, particularly in these days of deregulated shop trading hours and increased competition for the retail dollar from the casino, poker machines and the like. But they will turn up if an issue really affects them. The minister's minuscule audience simply reflects the fact that there is nothing that his government is saying which is relevant to the concerns of small business. They will turn up if the issue is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Tuesday&mdash;a week ago&mdash;not 30 people but more than 1,000 small business people, retail tenants and franchisees turned up to a public meeting in Melbourne organised by Lisa Michael of the United Retailers Association and chaired by Steve Price of 3AW. That was a terrific meeting, but it was also an angry meeting, because many of the people there have seen their livelihoods ruined as a result of the way they have been treated by shopping centre managements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a woman from Box Hill shopping centre who, with her husband, has lost 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> her home. They are now living in a caravan park. There was a man from Northlands shopping centre who cannot pay the rent because the eastern end of the centre is being renovated and his customers&mdash;rather than walk through a construction site&mdash;are going elsewhere. When he asked for a rent reduction while the works were going on, the shopping centre management told him that he ought to declare himself bankrupt. There are many more outrageous cases, with people aged 50 and over losing the assets that they have worked for all their lives and staring down the financial barrel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At last Tuesday's meeting, I moved two motions that were carried unanimously. The first dealt with the Victorian situation. It urged the Victorian government to establish a retail tenancies tribunal with wide ranging powers to arbitrate disputes between landlords and retail tenants.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FITZGIBBON" NAMEID="8K6">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UK6">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. The second urged the federal government to support amendments to the Trade Practices Act which would prevent harsh or oppressive conduct by retail landlords and franchisors, and would give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission greater powers to stamp out such conduct. That unanimous resolution, as I pointed out to the meeting and as members of this House would recognise, picks up Kim Beazley's private member's bill on better business conduct&mdash;a bill which Labor tried to enact in government and has since pursued in opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the minister for small business and the Liberal government have refused to support or pass this bill. They talk the talk of small business. They tell small business, `We're on your side,' but when it comes down to the crunch they support big business. Retail tenants and franchisees are being exploited just as coalminers and shearers were in the previous century. They need more than words from the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bad news for those opposite is that the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), state opposition leader John Brumby and I told those retail tenants that last Tuesday night, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4138"> and they understood it from their own bitter experience.</PARA>

Having appeared before the inquiry, I was impressed with the grasp that those committee members had of the issues involved and their apparent sincerity and determination to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That report is a gem. It has certainly exceeded my expectations. The committee members who prepared it, both Labor and Liberal, should take a bow. It is really something for them to tell the kids and the grandkids about once their parliamentary days are over&mdash;about a blow that they have struck for justice and fairness in retailing in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It talked to small businesses.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UK6">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a report which comes from a committee which, as my colleague the member for Rankin said, did not just talk about small business but talked to small business. And don't the recommendations show it? It talks about a retail tenancy code which would establish specialist retail lease tribunals for quick and inexpensive dispute resolution. It talks about security of tenure for retail tenants, including rights to renewal of leases. It talks about market rent reviews only to be permitted on the renewal of a lease, and disclosure statements to outline provisions for rent reduction in the event of changes in the tenancy of a shopping centre. It talks about disclosure statements specifying how compensation will  be awarded for disturbance to trading caused by the redevelopment of shopping centres and relocation of tenants. So no more of this `Heads we win, tails you lose' attitude from shopping centre owners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need change. Look at some of the bankruptcy figures for recent months. In the quarter from January to March this year, parts 4 and 11 bankruptcies were 5,351 in 1997 compared with 4,413 in 1996&mdash;a rise in excess of 20 per cent. This is a government that says it is delivering for small business, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and you have got bankruptcies up in excess of 20 per cent. There is a similar situation in the year to date: in 1996&hyphen;97 bankruptcies were 15,910, 27 per cent up on the figure for 1995-96. That is the way they are delivering for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That we also need change is apparent when we look at the recommendations and some of the evidence that is put forward in the fair trading inquiry report. For example, Mary Caruana, who had a restaurant in the Box Hill Central Shopping Centre, told the committee that on one occasion when the tenants wanted to have a meeting centre management reacted by ordering the security guards to lock the doors and turn off the lights at closing time, notwithstanding there were still customers in the centre who had to leave by a trade entrance. That is the attitude they take towards tenants even daring to have a meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the misrepresentations? Jean Sietzema&hyphen;Dixon, also of the Box Hill Central Shopping Centre, talked about misrepresentations: about traffic flow through the centre, the impending closure of a major store not being mentioned, returns not as represented by the vendor and the post office being relocated. None of those things were mentioned to prospective tenants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later on in the report there is a case study of a relocation where the proprietor of a toy shop in Campbelltown in New South Wales was told that they should relocate their operation and that no other toy stores would be allowed in there. As a result they paid out an enormous amount of money to relocate that business. Then they were informed in October 1994 that Lend Lease were going to put a mega toy store in the centre. When Ms Hewitt asked where this left her, the managers said, `Pack your bags and get out of here. I can't be any clearer than that. You're extinct, you're a dinosaur, you're not wanted any more.' When she said that she had been told that no larger toy store would be opening in the centre for the term of her lease the manager allegedly replied, `So? We lied.' That is the kind of treatment that retail tenants have been receiving and that is the sort of thing we need to change.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4139">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is the acid test for the Howard government regarding small business. Don't give us the Bell committee&mdash;it's had the gong. Don't give us capital gains rollovers. The shopping centre owners will not allow retail tenants to assign their leases or even renew their leases. So these people do not get any capital gains to speak about. Don't give us unfair dismissals. These people will not need to dismiss staff if they are given a fair go. Spare us the small business rhetoric; just show the parliament and the people of Australia that you are fair dinkum by introducing legislation that will put these excellent recommendations, arising as they have done in a bipartisan way, into place as soon as possible. If you cannot get the legislation into parliament before the House rises, then pass Kim Beazley's bill which is all dressed up and raring to go.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Albury, on 22 May 1942, Robert Menzies made his famous `forgotten people' speech. Arguably that was the beginning of the renaissance of the Liberal Party. It was the speech that propelled the Liberal Party into government. Sadly, those `forgotten people' have been forgotten again. The last member to speak, the member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent), in talking about the triumphs of small business in his electorate was really celebrating the indomitable spirit of small business that has striven, and struggled, and survived against the actions of all governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is this: there is a philosophical concept that small business has to come to grips with, that is, the concept of rational economics or economic rationalism. They have to deal with the concept that underlies the Hilmer report, that fraudulent, failed document so celebrated by Paul Keating. What that document does is celebrate big business. Economic rationalism does not promote competition; it promotes oligopoly. When Hilmer says small business must compete on the same level playing field as big business, it spells the demise of small business. Once small business is removed, of course, there is no restraint on big business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you a story that happened to me recently. I tried, on behalf of an Australian company&mdash;a medium&hyphen;sized Australian company, I guess you would call it&mdash;to take over and buy the Port Kembla copper smelters because CRA wanted out and wanted to sell their 50 per cent to their Japanese partners. The Australian company's proposal was to dismantle it, take it to Cloncurry and add an acid stripper to process the Duchess phosphate mine. It was extremely well documented. They simply asked if I could put in a word for them to the FIRB.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I phoned the FIRB and they said, `We don't know anything about it.' I expressed surprise and said, `I will get the information for you. I will have it couriered today.' Within an hour they had phoned back my office and said, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4142"> `No, Mr Campbell, we have found it and it is all we need.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next day they made a decision to sell that to the Japanese. When I phoned the head of the FIRB, I think he thought I was going to attack him, but I simply said, `What happened?' He said, `Mr Campbell, the reality is that governments of all persuasions preferred foreign capital over the last 20 years.' I said, `Yes, I wonder why that is.' `I don't know,' was his response, `I guess it is the capital inflow to balance the current account.' He said, `The problem with that is that when these companies become more than 51 per cent Australian owned, they simply don't pay any tax.' That is one of the reasons for the big cost on small business. They have to pay the tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the big areas of small business is the retail trade. What did the chairman of Woolworths recently say? With 24&hyphen;hour trading they are going to increase their gross take by 12&half; per cent. They intend to get that off small business because, as the chairman said, `Let's face it, they have got to sleep some time.' That really, I think, puts a responsibility on all Australians. It may be convenient, but there is no need to buy a pound of spuds or a new hat at 2 o'clock in the morning; it is a nonsense. There is no doubt that 24&hyphen;hour trading will see the demise of small business in the retail sector. We have seen large shopping centres consistently give the big client a rent based on a percentage of turnover, but they charge the small businesses per square foot with inflation clauses. Then they introduce late night trading and further depress the ability to compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is nonsense for the opposition to wax eloquent about this because they were there and they did nothing about it. They are as guilty as the government is because, quite frankly, both the government and the opposi tion support large business. The truth is, of course, that the unions have always supported big business. They have always found it better to deal with big business. Very few of them know how to deal with small business. I can give you an example of that in the magnificent high&hyphen;speed aluminium ship industry that was created mainly in Western Australia&mdash;the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry that the present government is setting about to destroy by removing the bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went down on one occasion to visit the place and I asked about union membership. A man said, `Yes, we have got some union members here, we think.' I said, `What is your policy on your unions?' He said, `We haven't got one, but we pay well over awards and no&hyphen;one seems to bother.' I actually sought out some members of the union and they said they were members for historic reasons: `The union never comes near us, they can't do anything.' Of course the union could have done something for them. If they had got down there and said, `Look, your livelihood depends on the maintenance of the bounty and we will fight to keep the bounty for you, we will be in there lobbying for this and we will keep you informed,' they would have got those members. But the unions were not capable of that because they had been brought up in this field of confrontation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been made about interest rates. The truth about interest rates is that it really depends where you are in the small business spectrum. If you went into small business with large prospects at a time when you know interest rates are high, you invariably will get a benefit when they drop. Interest rates are low at the moment, that is true, and they are low because there is a depressed economy. There are things that drive up interest rates. Capital inflow, which was needed to fund the current account deficit, of course drove up interest rates, and that was bad. But I can remember that I was in small business in the late 1970s and early 1980s when interest rates went to unprecedented levels, equally as high as they achieved under Keating's mismanagement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in small business on two occasions and I survived&mdash;in fact, I prospered&mdash;in very difficult times, so I do understand the problems. It is nonsense for the government to say there has been a reduction in paperwork. The paperwork burden is still enormous. The government is now clearly working towards a GST which is going to put an even greater burden on small business because small business, not big business, will bear the brunt of the collection of that tax. Big business will just alter the software.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think, if the government is legitimate about its concern for taxation, it should report in this House on the benefits of the debit tax, where there is no impost on small business. It is quite clear the tax can be equally distributed, and it can be distributed across those large companies that now do not pay any tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that the Labor Party's unfair dismissal legislation was an impediment on small business&mdash;a far bigger impediment than it need be because it intimidated people. In many cases it did not apply, but small business thought it did, and no-one ever really sought to explain how they could avoid it. It is an idea that should be swept away, and I can see no valid reason for the Labor Party opposing in the Senate the abolition of the unfair dismissal legislation. Small business does not employ people to sack them. Small business employs people when it sees an opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say something in my closing two minutes about small business. Its ability to employ people is enormous. I took to this government a plan, which was put to me by small business, to employ school leavers  doing the vocational course at high schools. They were kids who had learnt the exact requirements, in respect of computers, of small business. So you had computer literate kids and you had computer literate small business with all of the machinery.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's response was brilliant but simple. It was put into Vanstone's office and it was killed. What came out was this mishmash where schools are expected to be employment agencies. Good heavens! Many teachers cannot even speak to themselves let alone talk to small business. The missing link is they do not have the contacts for employment, and that is where the government's $200 million a year scheme will fail&mdash;a $200 million scheme against $9 million one-off. We said to the government, `Run it as a pilot project&mdash;half a million dollars.'<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was rejected. Why? Ultimately because the government has no ideas other than those put to it by the senior people in DEETYA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is they have no interest in reducing unemployment, because they see it as job security. That is a sad fact of the matter. They do not want a system which is going to substantially reduce it. We reckon this scheme could reduce general unemployment by one per cent and youth unemployment probably by seven per cent. It was thrown away. It was an enormously wasteful exercise by the government, that sought to implement its scheme which will be ongoing and which will never succeed but will probably never fail significantly enough to be abolished. The hyperbole in this House is appalling, and it comes from both sides. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The amendments to the AIDC Sale Bill 1997 made by the Senate formalise the position which the government had already stated: that it would quarantine the Australian Submarine Corporation shareholding from the sale of AIDC Ltd. These amendments place a statutory obligation on the Minister for Finance to transfer the shares in the Submarine Corporation to the Australian Industry Development Corporation, the parent statutory authority which is not proposed for sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments make use of the existing ministerial powers of transfer in the AIDC Sale Bill and so ensure that the other provisions in the bill retain the appropriate cross&hyphen;referencing. The amendments then place a restriction on the corporation to prevent it from selling the shareholding in the ASC to a foreign person. This is defined using the meaning provided by the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment (1) makes some technical changes to section 33K to require the registration of the shareholdings. Amendment (2) is a substantive amendment which inserts a new section 33KA after section 33K to make specific provision for the shares in the ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsection (1) of that proposed new section provides that, if an AIDC body holds the legal or beneficial interest in ASC shares, then the Minister for Finance must use the powers already in the bill to make a declaration to vest those shares in the Australian Industry Development Corporation. That power must be exercised before 1 September 1997. Provision is made for the move of the shares to the corporation to be made directly or through a series of steps. This flexibility recognises that the shares in ASC are held by a succession of wholly owned subsidiaries of AIDC Ltd. There may be a practical or legal reason for moving the shares through the subsidiaries 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4145"> rather than directly. The drafting provides the flexibility necessary, recognising the commercial nature of the arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsection (2) of the proposed new section provides that the Australian Industry Development Corporation may subsequently sell or transfer the ASC shares. However, under subsection (3), the corporation must not sell or transfer the shares to a foreign person within the meaning of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, except where there are pre&hyphen;emptive rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Submarine Corporation Pty Ltd is a private company in which the shareholders can be under obligations to other shareholders in the event of sale or transfer of the shares. As the ASC is a private company, there may be in existence pre&hyphen;emptive rights of acquisition of other parties' shares. These rights could be held by each of the shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By placing the statutory restriction on the exercising of those rights by one of the shareholders, it could be argued that the Commonwealth was appropriating the economic interests of that party, giving rise to a claim for compensation or possibly undermining the validity of that provision. The amendment is drafted and protects those rights but, in exercising those rights, the foreign party would have to demonstrate that they existed and that they were not inconsistent with other statutory restrictions that may have applied at the time of conferring those rights. Subsections (3) and (4) are for clarification and definition purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, the amendments give affect to the government's general approach to the ASC's shareholding. Although the same result could have effectively been achieved without them, they are supported by the government as  clarifying the position with respect to this important strategic asset.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This AIDC Sale Bill 1997 was introduced on 22 February and makes legislative amendments to enable the sale of the Australian Industry Development Corporation, known as the AIDC. It has now been returned from the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate where it was amended by the Democrats. The government have just indicated that they will be accepting those amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not be moving our amendments again nor will we be opposing the bill. There is no point, given the deal that the Democrats have done with the government. Labor still does have significant concerns with the legislation as it relates to the AIDC shareholding in the Australian Submarine Corporation. We firmly believe that the Democrats' amendments do address some of the concerns that we have raised, but they just do not go far enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, we sought, by way of amendment, to get the government to park the Australian Submarine Corporation in AIDC Ltd thus ensuring that the submarine corporation shares stayed in public ownership so that they could be used as effective leverage for building a defence&hyphen;based heavy engineering and marine engineering industry in this country, a means by which the government can deal itself into the game. The only game we know the minister for industry wants to deal himself into is Black Jack. Black Jack is his suit. If it comes to industry development, no appearance&mdash;no appearance in Newcastle, no appearance to defend the future interests of Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We sought to ensure that any sale of the Australian Submarine Corporation had to come back to this parliament. This was the government who said, `We are going to be more open and more accountable in the parliament.' But what they are going to do is enable the sell off of Australia's interests in the submarine corporation without it even coming back to the parliament. What sort of accountability is that? These are the deals behind the scene. The deals that those on the other side of politics&mdash;the tories&mdash;are notorious for. What have they got to hide? Why are they not prepared to bring this sale of Australian national interests back to the parliament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats' deal with the government enables those deals for the sale of the Australian Submarine Corporation to be done without the scrutiny of parliament. Nor is there any requirement for the Australian Submarine 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4146"> Corporation under these arrangements to be owned by the Australian people. Here we have the defence industry&mdash;national interests&mdash;and not only are they prepared to allow the deal to sell those shares to be done behind closed doors with no scrutiny by the parliament but they are prepared to let it be sold off to foreigners too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the national interest in that? Where are the interests of the nation involved in that sort of shabby exercise? What we sought to do through our amendments was to achieve both ends: public ownership and parliamentary scrutiny&mdash;principles that we thought the Democrats were committed to. Their support for the government is disappointing, to say the least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDC was established in 1970 as an investment bank to finance Australian industry. Its role was, if you like, to fill the gap that was not at the time adequately covered by the banking sector or by other lenders. The AIDC was to lend capital to development projects that otherwise would not have taken place or in circumstances where the only finance available was through foreign investment. The AIDC has over the years pioneered infrastructure financing and has proven its unique ability to turn public policy into reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDC reacts as a policy lever for national development. Two of the many significant examples of developments that occurred because of the AIDC were the Woodside North West Shelf gas project&mdash;that huge investment which involved $US1.6 billion of financing&mdash;as well as another significant and huge project, the Argyle Diamond project. In that case, the AIDC was the only Australian financier. Were it not for the AIDC, we would not have had the Australian equity in that project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the AIDC has performed well. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> Whilst the AIDC  did make losses in 1991, most banks also reported major losses in that period. It did not, however, need to draw on its government guarantee. The primary reason for the loss was the AIDC moving away from its core business of infrastructure and resources. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor Party still believes there is a significant role for the government to play in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDC is one of two Australian controlled and independent investment houses. Through the sale there is every chance that the AIDC could be purchased by overseas owners. We talk about correcting the current account and we talk about the concerns about foreign debt. Foreign ownership can occur because there are no special provisions in the legislation that has come forward to deal with foreign ownership. We have had some assurances from Senator Kemp that, if the buyer of the AIDC is an overseas buyer, the 48&half; per cent AIDC holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation would be excluded from that sale. Whilst we note that assurance, we still believe that there should have been appropriate legislative backing to ensure that such an outcome could not be adversely affected. That is again why we moved our amendments&mdash;to protect Australian assets, Australian jobs and Australian industry from being wholly owned by foreign interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor accept that the AIDC did move away from its original charter, but we do not accept that there is no longer any need for such a company as that originally proposed when the AIDC was established. Our amendments sought to require the government to come back to this House with some suggestions on that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another reason why Labor opposed the sale of AIDC with the submarine corporation attached. We believed that the AIDC bill offered the parliament a chance to show a strategic direction and leadership in regard to using publicly owned assets invested in heavily by the nation to develop our defence industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we wanted, as I said before, was to park the submarine corporation in AIDC Ltd so that the parliament could determine to whom the submarine corporation could be sold or would be sold and then to seek to use our holding to leverage a commitment to a defence based industry in this country. We saw this constituting a major plank in our defence policy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4147">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently I had the opportunity with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the shadow minister for defence, the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and the shadow minister for employment to announce a major policy initiative to encourage the development of this defence based industry. We said that we wanted to develop a new heavy engineering and shipbuilding venture, one that would be based in Adelaide and meet both the local and global defence and civilian requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the piecemeal approach to the sale of ADI, Australian Defence Industries, and the AIDC which has been taken by this government lacks vision and has certainly no coherence or commitment to an Australian based industry of the type we have described. Labor's approach would have provided the parliament and the people of Australia with an opportunity to direct the future of manufacturing industry in this country. The beauty of the approach is that it would not have cost the government; it was revenue neutral because we were seeking to use existing government equity in both ADI and the submarine corporation to develop a nucleus for a new venture that would have attracted private sector involvement where we could have consolidated and expanded Australia's heavy engineering and shipbuilding capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would have required that the new venture be majority Australian owned with the majority of directors being Australian. An international equity partner would have been sought to further broaden the new venture's scope and to enhance the export linkages. By combining our strengths in military and civilian manufacturing in heavy engineering, particularly in maritime engineering, Australia could have become a successful internationally competitive player.</PARA>

It was these sorts of policies that saw, under Labor, the defence industry grow significantly in terms of the provision of defence needs from this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would remind the House that when Labor came to office&mdash;and we inherited this situation from the Liberals back in 1983&mdash;John Howard was the Treasurer and little more than one&hyphen;quarter of the defence capital expenditure budget was spent in Australia. The overwhelming proportion went overseas, which effectively denied local industry any prospect of growth in an important domestic market and restricted export opportunities. Labor significantly expanded the provision of defence capability and capital expenditure from Australian producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are now seeing under this government is a Prime Minister and his ministers wanting to take the nation back to those dark ages of the 1970s, when we did not support our local industries. It is not time to throw away important national assets through this piecemeal approach to the sale of ADI and the ASC. What we now need is the strategic development of an industry which is capable and able to expand and create new job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reason that Labor moved an amendment to this legislation is that there is a continuing role for the AIDC in relation to the issue of access to capital. A gap still exists in the market that needs to be filled to help our industry sectors and to further encourage development, growth and job creation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every report produced and every business you speak to says that access to capital is one of the biggest hurdles to industry growth and job creation. Recently, we had the government cut back on funding for the business angels program. The government said that there was no longer any need for any distortion to occur in the marketplace. That program was, in fact, one of the few programs that offered any type of assistance to small business enterprises seeking to grow or expand their business. The AIDC provided a source of Australian capital to those firms that would otherwise have had to go offshore for investment capital or decide not to proceed with the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small&hyphen; to medium&hyphen;sized businesses are critical to our economic growth and to the diversity of our economic base. The ability of these firms to access capital at affordable levels is the difference between a project 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4148"> proceeding or being quashed. We, as the Labor Party, still believe that the role that the AIDC was set up to play is still required. The government of today is doing nothing to fill this gap. The industry minister, Black Jack Moore, does not believe that there is a role for government in industry policy. Instead, he is actively cutting back on industry programs. Cuts to the DIFF scheme, the bounties, Austrade and AusIndustry, as well as the R&amp;D tax concessions, are examples of where industry assistance has been cut back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting that we had tabled today&mdash;a delayed tabling, I might say, because it normally comes out with the budget papers&mdash;the science and technology budget statement for 1997&hyphen;98, which shows a total collapse of support for industrial R&amp;D in this country. It shows that support for industrial research and development will fall to $241 million this financial year&mdash;less than one&hyphen;third the level reached in 1994&hyphen;95. It is the lowest level of expenditure in 12 years. And this is a government that wants to talk about us going back to the past. This is the effect of their policies&mdash;their short&hyphen;sighted, bottom line approach to so&hyphen;called fiscal discipline. It is gutting the basis upon which Australian industry has been encouraged to be innovative and creative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In last year's budget, the government estimated that industrial research and development would fall from $717 million. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> I promise I will not do this again, but I thank the House for the opportunity to continue.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government said that industrial research and development would fall from $717 million in 1995&hyphen;96 to $470 million in 1996&hyphen;97. That was bad enough, but today's figures show that the government has slashed another $170 million and will cut another $60 million next year. This is at a time when the government admits the biggest problem facing Australian science is the low level of business spending on R&amp;D. It is a time when every other advanced  industrialised country is increasing their effort on R&amp;D.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Yellow Pages Small Business Index survey released today shows that the manufacturing sector has suffered a collapse in confidence and is now at its lowest level in almost four years. This bill is going to do nothing to lift that confidence. This bill will see another growth in manufacturing opportunity go begging.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government promised at the last election to create 200,000 new manufacturing jobs. Where are they going to come from? They could have come from the defence industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the AIDC Sale Bill was first introduced into the House of Representatives the opposition moved amendments to strengthen the position of the Australian Submarine Corporation and to ensure that the government was in a position to use its holdings in the Submarine Corporation to lever a new development in heavy engineering and shipbuilding, particularly in defence related industries. It could do that both through its holding of the Submarine Corporation shares and through its ownership of ADI, Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) rejected the opposition's amendments. They indicated that they supported many of the concepts that were being advanced, but they were not willing to endorse the amendments. On that occasion, the Minister for Finance referred to the fact that they did not intend to sell off the Submarine Corporation shares with the rest, but they did not want any amendment to restrict their flexibility. He went on to say that the government could place that shareholding in the defence portfolio. It could place it in the industry portfolio. It could place the ASC in an Australian company or it could place the ASC in that most appropriate department for protecting the assets of government, the Department of Finance. I suspect that certainly the last of those mentioned was tongue in cheek. When you look at the rest of the propositions they are equally ludicrous.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Confronted with a reasonable position from the opposition, this government refused to see its legislation amended, refused to see a protection put in place for heavy engineering and shipbuilding and refused to give the parliament a role in considering what should happen to this major national asset&mdash;nearly half the holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation&mdash;before it is hived off. We now have the bill back before the House of Representatives, having been amended in the Senate as a result of a deal, as member for Hotham (Mr Crean) said, between the government and the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wording of that amendment does pick up some of the issues which the opposition sought to deal with when this bill was first before the House of Representatives, but it also includes some interesting additions. It does provide the government with the opportunity to sell off the Submarine Corporation shares. There will be no further recourse to the parliament and there will be no further accountability in this matter. The government can proceed in its piecemeal grab for cash to sell the Submarine Corporation and thereby lose a golden opportunity that Australia has at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a window of opportunity. This is not a long-term situation. It is not a static situation. Both in defence and industry terms the markets are very volatile. The opportunities to actually restructure Australian heavy engineering and shipbuilding, particularly as it relates to defence, are being presented to this country at this time. That window of opportunity is not going to be there for long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government proceeds down the track that it has embarked upon with these vital national assets&mdash;piecemeal sales of key assets such as the Submarine Corporation shares and ADI, which the Minister for Defence quite flippantly announced in answer to a dorothy dixer and did not do the parliament the courtesy of making a statement on&mdash;then we will miss a rare opportunity to build for this country a heavy engineering and shipbuilding capacity that is internationally competitive and will see us well into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only reason we have that capacity today is that the Labor government and Labor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4150"> defence ministers took what were quite courageous decisions at that time to have things like the frigates and submarines built in Australia. In contrast to the sorts of attitudes which conservative defence ministers in a time&hyphen;honoured manner had adopted, which was to go and buy a second-hand ship from the United States or a second-hand ship from the United Kingdom, we took a punt on Australian industry because we had the confidence in Australian industry to produce the goods. They have done that magnificently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a situation where the peak of that work has flowed through on current estimations and we need to look at a restructure of the industry. The government is in a unique position to do that, both as a stakeholder and as a major consumer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much has been said this week about symbolism and outcomes, the government rejecting symbolism and perhaps the opposition talking more about a coherent set of outcomes but connected with a philosophy and an associated set of processes. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would not be surprised that, coming from South Australia and the seat of Port Adelaide, I would have some pretty strong views on industry policy, manufacturing industry and the maximisation of employment opportunities. The AIDC and the success of the Australian Submarine Corporation and its spin-offs, particularly in defence industry jobs, is an extremely powerful symbol for the people of South Australia, as is the car industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDC, established in 1970 as an investment bank to finance Australian industry, filled a gap which was not covered by the bank or lending sector and which probably, as the shadow minister has pointed out, will not  be covered in the future. Our amendments sought but two things really: public ownership 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and parliamentary scrutiny. You can argue about the philosophy of the first one, but certainly you cannot argue with the second one. South Australians, including the state Liberal government, are extremely worried&mdash;and justifiably so&mdash;at the federal government's intentions or, more correctly, its lack of intention towards manufacturing industry and the general environment in which you can grow and create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's government believes there is no role for government in manufacturing industry. Certainly the budget just brought down gives no confidence whatsoever that the government will meet its election promise to create 200,000 new manufacturing jobs by the year 2000. That is on top of last year's assault of $2.9 billion on assistance programs to industry. There is no sign whatsoever of any rethink of industry policy. What there is, though, is a massive projected decline in assistance to manufacturing industry. From 1997&hyphen;98 to 2000&hyphen;01 assistance to manufacturing will decline from $561 million to $146 million. In addition to that, assistance to exporters declines by $26 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government appears incapable of solving problems with current economic orthodoxies. With current economic, industry, education, transport and environmental policies, unemployment&mdash;this real curse of the modern developed world&mdash;is likely to be entrenched at unacceptable levels. The government appears unaware of any analysis or basic principles or understanding of the trends in industries throughout the world. During the last 50 years, capital investment in industry has quadrupled, energy consumption has tripled, manufacturing output has tripled. But the real catch is that unemployment has grown by a third and we have a human surplus of labour of 10 per cent plus and that figure is growing. That is the situation not just in Australia but in every country in the OECD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employment in traditional industries such as textiles, iron and steel and metals processing is declining, whilst employment in electronics, telecommunications and biotechnology is gaining, but nowhere to the extent that is needed to take up the labour surplus. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4151"> know that the micro-electronic industry, for example, has spawned whole new industries, but it has also frighteningly reduced the need for labour throughout the world. Throughout the industrialised world and in this country too we are substituting capital, energy and increased output for human labour which is in surplus. I make this point as emphatically as I can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Traditional economic growth no longer is always accompanied by a commensurate increase in the number of jobs. There is a role for government. There must be a role for government. There is a role for public ownership. There must be a role for scrutiny in parliament, let alone a desperate need for an industry policy in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a much bigger role to play in stimulating growth, development and job creation than merely sitting on their hands with low inflation and low interest rates. The Australian people expect this government to lead. There is no doubt that over the years the AIDC has acted as a very positive policy lever for national development and national infrastructure. The Yellow Pages Small Business Index survey released today shows quite clearly that the manufacturing sector has suffered a collapse of confidence and is at its lowest level in four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Differentiation ought to be made to sectors of business. One sector is essentially made up of resellers and distributors. They are not very good at creating jobs. The important sector is that made up of the builders and the makers of things. They are the real wealth generators in this nation. They are the job creators. They need these big national development projects like the Woodside North West Shelf gas project and the Argyle diamond mine and the Australian submarine and frigate projects. They need national infrastructure projects, but they will not happen if they rely on the traditional finance sector. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, that is there designed to accommodate the needs of one firm, a shareholder in the Submarine Corporation and a major partner in the Submarine Corporation, and that is Kockums. Kockums have done a very good job and have been very good partners with the AIDC and with Australian defence in producing a genuine world&hyphen;class submarine, so I have no qualms about that. But I think the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) himself made the observation quite properly when this matter was before the parliament on 20 March when this issue came up. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have no problem with the Swedes; they have done a very good job; but they are a foreigner.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister, on 20 March, was dead right. In a strategic holding such as the Submarine Corporation, do we regard it as in our defence interests, as in the interests of building a heavy engineering and shipbuilding capacity for Australia, to see a 100 per cent foreign owned venture, irrespective of who that external body may be? The comments that the Minister for Defence made on 20 March were prudent. Unfortunately, the government has now gone ahead and agreed to an amendment which says that, if they want to, they can sell it to a foreign shareholder who is on the register at the moment. I suppose it is theoretically possible that before this bill comes into force they might decide to sell out, but I think that is a pretty unlikely proposition. We have here an amendment to a bill that does not even meet the requirements which the Minister for Defence set down on 20 March as being desirable.</PARA>

The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) referred to parts of that document which was jointly released by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and a number of shadow ministers in Adelaide&mdash;indeed, just outside the Submarine Corporation. At that time the Minister for Defence attacked that statement in a press release of 22 April which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Defence, Mr Ian McLachlan, said today that Mr Beazley's decision to oppose the sale of Australian Defence Industries and government equity in the Submarine Corporation is a reversion to discredited industry policies of the past.</PARA>

We have had the Newcastle steel situation where there seemed to be a lack of interest, a lack of care. Where is the government's role?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Bevis has mentioned the opportunities we have in shipbuilding and the heavy engineering&mdash;an area that will be demanding incredible amounts of manufactured products. We are in a position to do that. We have opportunities. Many people in my father's generation regret that in the 1950s and 1960s, when we had opportunities to lead the world in a whole range of areas, we relied on basic raw commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think manufacturing industry would like to hear from the government. Just give us some sort of clue, some sort of leadership, as to where you expect manufacturing industry to go in this country. What message are you giving to people? What message are you giving to people who want to invest? You are saying, `Hands off. Let the market rip. You are on your own.' What does that say to maximising employment opportunities?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking back at previous eras of industry policy, and given the past life of the Minister for Defence as shadow minister for industry, I noted that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> in 1991 reported the now minister's plans in relation to the car industry, also a major employer and earner for the state of South Australia, in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's car makers are running scared of a coalition victory in the next federal election.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was 1993, of course. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Causing the concern is an unreported speech to the federal chamber of automotive industries by the shadow minister for industry and commerce, Ian McLachlan, which bluntly warned of savage cuts in car industry protection after 1996 if a Liberal-National party government were elected in 1993. Senior car industry executives present at the meeting were said to have been stunned by the strength of Mr McLachlan's remarks. "They effectively pull the wheels off the federal government's post&hyphen;1992 car plan."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In fact, they had a caption for Mr McLachlan that simply read `Ian McLachlan: a spoke in the wheels.' That was a fairly unkind but nonetheless telling presentation of the flat earth, dry approach to these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government proceeds down the track of a fire sale of these key assets, continues to get the most money it can from these two ventures&mdash;the sale of ASC shares and ADI&mdash;and simply looks to the cash in the budget, it will throw away a rare opportunity. Not only will it throw away a rare opportunity; it will also condemn the industry to struggle needlessly over a period of some years in an effort to establish itself as internationally competitive without the growth that it was able to have in the last decade by virtue of Kim Beazley and Robert Ray, former ministers for defence, who ensured that a major slice of defence shipbuilding and heavy engineering acquisitions were channelled through Australian workplaces, as opposed to simply buying second-hand product from overseas. If the government goes down that track, it will pass up a rare opportunity and do a great disservice to future generations and to that industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4154">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the minister publicly attacked the statement put out by the opposition, and I guess that is part of the political banter that always goes on in these scenarios, but I would strongly urge the minister and the government to revisit the proposal that the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, Martin Ferguson and I released. That does provide a framework in which this opportunity can be picked up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can in fact build on the strength we established over the last decade in that industry. Prior to that it did not exist, quite frankly. Not only can we establish an important industry for Australia; we can also establish a sustainability for the Defence Force that is critical if we actually want to have a Defence Force that can do something other than fight a war for a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are important decisions. These things should be before the national parliament. Sadly, the amendment agreed to between the government and the Democrats will see this matter now hived off for cabinet and ministerial decision. It will not come back to the parliament. That is a sad thing for such an important decision. That being so, I strongly urge the government to revisit our statement. It is, in my view, a good piece of policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the requested amendments be made.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996 establishes the largest commitment to environmental management in Australia's history. The Australian community has long demanded a serious and committed approach by government towards the restoration and maintenance of the environment and towards ensuring that agricultural production is undertaken truly sustainably. The coalition is now delivering this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next five years $1.25 billion will be invested through the Natural Heritage Trust. The Natural Heritage Trust will introduce a coordinated and integrated policy approach, which has been sadly lacking in the past; it will provide an enormous increase in the level of funding for landcare and many other initiatives; it will provide funding certainty for future years; and it will provide a far greater proportion of spending on the ground and in the water where it matters. This is what the Australian community has de 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4156"> manded of government for so long&mdash;and the coalition has delivered just what is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some minor amendments have been made to the bill in the Senate, and today we have an opportunity to formally consider them. The amendments listed as schedule A amendments are those sought by the government and will, firstly, allow an increase in the trust capital of $100 million; secondly, fix the trust's minimum balance at $300 million; and, thirdly, establish arrangements for interest earned by the trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The schedule B amendments also derive from the Senate and, whilst not originating with the government, are acceptable to the government. They include, firstly, that there should be clarification that agreements for reserve funding can be entered jointly as well as separately by both the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for the Environment; secondly, establishing the Natural Heritage Trust Advisory Committee; thirdly, changing the name of the board to the Natural Heritage Ministerial Board; and, fourthly, making revisions to the preamble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Natural Heritage Trust will bring considerable benefit to current and future generations of Australians. It will provide an integrated and coordinated approach towards land, water, vegetation and biodiversity management. It will provide $1.25 billion over five years, which is a huge increase on any government commitment of the past. The Natural Heritage Trust will provide much needed funding for community groups to undertake work on the full range of environmental challenges we face&mdash;whether it be the enhancement of our land and water resources, the protection of our native animal and plant species, the improvement of our rivers, estuaries and wetlands, the widespread planting of trees, the control of feral animals and weeds or the cleaning up of our beaches and coastal regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very exciting program, which will bring about significant environmental improvements for this and future generations. It is important for rural and regional Australia, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as it will provide assistance to community groups to undertake much needed on&hyphen;ground works. This, in turn, will create a sustainable resource base for primary industries for the future so they can continue to prosper and bring continued benefits to rural and urban communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is serious about both the environment and sustainable agricultural production. This is a very important moment for this House and for this nation. I call on all members of the House to support this historic bill, which will deliver considerable long-term benefits to the nation and its people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Natural Heritage Trust legislation is a con; it is a gimmick. It is a gimmick that has been designed to disguise this government's massive cuts to environmental expenditure and its appalling anti-environmental decisions. One needs to simply go through a list of those benchmarks that have been broken by this government, starting as follows. You can see that the government has cut the environment budget by $55&half; million over the next three years and robbed the Natural Heritage Trust of some $83 million which it promised in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting Our Commitments</EMPHASIS>  document to the Australian people at the last election for the first two years of operation of the trust alone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has given the green light to Keith Williams's massive Hinchinbrook resort development, despite departmental and scientific advice which concluded that it would have an adverse impact on world heritage values on the adjacent Hinchinbrook Channel. It has given state government veto powers over the listing of world heritage areas. It has attempted to abolish its export controls for minerals. It has abolished the ethanol bounty scheme designed to assist with the development of cheap, cleaner fuels. It has cut labour market programs with significant environmental components, such as LEAP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has significantly reduced available funding for a range of greenhouse measures, particularly the Greenhouse 21C measures. It has abolished the Energy Research and Development Corporation, which was established to direct research in Australia into ways in which we could develop more energy efficient 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4157"> technologies so that we could meet our greenhouse targets. It has slashed $50 million over four years from the Commonwealth energy research and efficiency program at precisely the same time that Australia must ensure credibility in greenhouse gas reductions. It has shown no leadership to curtail the land clearances that are occurring in Queensland. And it has all but given the green light to the expansion of uranium mining in the Kakadu world heritage area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been improved slightly since it was last debated in this chamber some seven months ago. The Senate has made some improvements, but the amendments do not go far enough and the trust is still essentially a slush fund: it is a slush fund where two ministers of the Crown will have at their disposal a massive discretionary fund which they will pay out to their electoral advantage and, in doing so, they will abuse the trust that the Australian people placed in them at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go to some of the specifics that were dealt with in the Senate. Firstly, there is the fund itself. When the fund was proposed, it was a $1 billion fund. The government would have us believe that the increase of $100 million to the trust is out of their deep commitment to protecting and conserving the environment. But it is nothing of the sort. The $100 million increase is part of an arrangement that the government made with Senator Harradine to ensure the passage of the partial sale of the Telstra bill in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, while increasing the fund by $100 million in one breath, the government deviously tried to rob the fund of effectively $42 million each year through its proposed amendment to extend the trust fund from five to six years. What we actually had was an attempt not to operate a fund over five years instead but the government proposing an amendment, without indicating to the opposition parties the nature of its proposal, suggesting that the amendments it was sneaking through on budget&hyphen;night eve were designed  simply to facilitate the obtaining of an interest rate of eight per cent, lying to those who were both representing the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats, and then being found out.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, they were found out before what was taken as a technical amendment was passed. The next day the Senate debated those very matters and rejected the amendment. The attempt to bleed the fund effectively of $42 million per annum was defeated in the Senate. The government reluctantly now comes before the House of Representatives and says that it will accept the will of the parliament and it will maintain its fund over five years. But it is devious even in that. It is devious because it is not going to increase those funds available to the environment for the current period of the life of this parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to comment on these amendments because they represent a small improvement to the original bill. It needs to be said that, while we on this side were totally opposed to the sale of Telstra to fund an environment fund of this kind, we were not opposed in principle to the notion of providing additional funds for the environment. We recognise that there is a significant need to improve funding for the environment and the coordination of environmental actions by all levels of government. As we have watched this unfold, we have become more and more sceptical. Not only is the money replacing what is in the consolidated revenue; it is entirely an ad hoc process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was amazed today to hear the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) boast about funds being allocated for various programs to improve riverine environments particularly and to reverse the very significant problems that exist in the use of that land. I applaud that. It is not necessarily an environmental program per se, but it is worth doing. However, it breaches all the principles that the minister was outlining in his answer to the question that was given to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was trying to inform the House that there would be all these checks and balances against the possibility of these funds being used as slush funds. He was repudiating the notion that it might be a pork barrel or that he would have anything to do with a white board. Yet the minister&mdash;and I am sure that he will be pleased to advise me if I am wrong&mdash;has gone ahead and allocated funds 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4158"> from this heritage trust fund without going through the processes that are outlined in this bill. Indeed, the bill has not yet passed through this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fund has not yet been established in law. It needs to be said to the wider community that this bill has been the longest in coming of any that I have seen for a very long time. It has been stagnating in the Senate for some time. It has been sitting there waiting for the government to give it the attention they claim it deserves. It has been launched I think four times counting the last by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). In this case, funds have been allocated from the fund without reference to the processes that have been outlined. I think the community should be sceptical about the operation of this fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community should also be sceptical about what it covers. I have raised this issue in this House before. A lot of the programs that the fund is now funding are ones that were previously out of consolidated revenue. We saw this again with the Prime Minister's launch last week. Many of those programs, as far as we can establish, particularly in the area of endangered species funding, are already under way. These are not new programs. These are not fancy new ideas from this highly controversial fund. These are old programs. They deserve to be continued, but they deserve to be continued from consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This fund has been and is a con of the electorate. When the Prime Minister, as the then Leader of the Opposition, walked through the forest and said that there would be all this additional money on top of the Labor government's funding, he was not expressing a view that was correct. He was deliberately misleading the Australian people. What we have seen is cuts to government funding. What we have seen in every area of environment policy is backward steps. The minister representing this area at the moment has outlined these comprehensively, so I will not do it again. These amendments make the smallest difference to the administration of this fund. The people of Australia should remain very sceptical about it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with some interest that the Australian Conservation Foundation through its board, not just through its executive, has expressed similar views. The headline of its most recent press release is that Australia's environment needs more than the Natural Heritage Trust. It needs a great deal more. It is not enough to simply throw money at these problems, although the money that has been thrown is a good deal less than was promised&mdash;indeed, derisively so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Council of the Australian Conservation Foundation have called&mdash;as they put it&mdash;for a fundamental rethink of the federal government's environment and economic policies. We are not having policies here. We are having tactics; we are having strategies; we are having ad hoc decisions. The minister wants to repudiate the idea of a white board, but I wish he at least had a white board&mdash;at least something to say what the government was doing rather than this bits and pieces policy which is being announced on an ad hoc basis, building partially on what has previously been done. We welcome the small improvements to this legislation, but they still fall far short of what was promised to the Australian people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) mentioned that money was thrown at the environment. In this case, no real money was thrown at the environment. But we found that the bundle of money thrown at the environment had a string attached to it. As soon as the money was thrown out and the people thought they had it at the disposal of the environment and sustainable agriculture, the string was pulled back. The money was wound in. The fish was caught, the votes were obtained, the baited hook was brought back abroad, the money was taken off the hook&mdash;and the sting was on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought the crudest part of the sting was the part I was mentioning in my last contribution to this debate. The crudest sting was when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) got up on budget night and announced as part of the budget the extension of the fund from five to six years. The only problem was&mdash;unlike the Fraser sting, when the Labor government in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4159"> the Senate did not know that the government was dismissed&mdash;that we found out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went through the fine print, and we discovered that the deceitful amendment that the government had proposed, deceitfully presented to both the Democrats, with whom it was negotiating, and the Labor Party, and technical amendments designed only to effect the interest rate on the trust, actually extended the life of the fund for an extra year but did not provide an extra dollar of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the effective outcome was the diminution of the fund by $42 million per annum. As I mentioned, the government now, caught out in this immoral behaviour, has accepted the reality of the fact that it cannot get that changed through the parliament. The budget has had its first setback, but so too has the faith of the Australian people, and rightly so because when the government said that it would accept these amendments it said, `Don't expect any bring forward off the committed funding for the first couple of years. Don't expect it for the life of this parliament.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those devious fellows are going to do the sting all over again. Will the funds that are supposed to be there now or in the third, fourth or fifth year of the fund be there? Will they be there after the next election? Not if this crowd has its way; not if it can manufacture one of the double dissolution election measures that it hopes to and get a Senate majority on something or another. No way. Suddenly we will find that bundle of money fished in again and the environment will be the poorer for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who would believe a government that in its election platform says, `We will set out what we will fund in each year of our government under this trust; in the first year we will spend so much money, this much in our second year, third, fourth and fifth years,' when what we find actually occurs in the first two years of the trust is that the fund is $83 million short? And that is just on the trust. That does not count any of the other programs that have been slashed in the environment area, in landcare, in the agricultural and primary industry area and in labour market programs that went to restoring the vegetative cover of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia. We have lost $83 million in lies in the first two years alone. Tricked. The Australian people have been tricked&mdash;reeled back, the bait, the con, the scam. The fix was in and then it was reeled back. Here it is&mdash;the greatest ever environmental program. What nonsense. Retreat from greenhouse, betrayal of environment promises, and a wretchedness of morality about this government that is actually hard to understand.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to make a few comments during consideration of these Senate amendments to the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill. My first observation is that what we are seeing here with this Natural Heritage Trust proposal is what I describe as the next chapter in the coalition's great rural hoax. In the budget we saw the savings hoax&mdash;the great tax rebate. When 67 per cent of Australian farms are running at a loss and rural workers are among the lowest paid in Australia, here is a great tax savings rebate for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other day we saw the great rural GST hoax. We had the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, out there promising country people that if we had a GST they would get a cut in petrol prices. The next day we had the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on Melbourne radio saying, `If we have a GST it will lessen income tax for workers.' It is all just a rural hoax. This one is probably the most devious of the lot&mdash;what we have now is the great environment hoax. Let me tell you why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the 15 months since the federal election every time the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has got up to talk about anything to do with the environment or the Telstra sale he has started off with his great proclamation about the world's greatest environmental package. I remember one day in this chamber actually saying the words before he said them and he overheard me and said, `Yes, the member for Burke has got it right&mdash;the world's greatest environmental package.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is new in it? Quite frankly, there is not one thing new. By combining some money in the primary industry budget with some money from the funds to flow from the sale of Telstra there are increases in some of these categories, but there is not one single

It is what used to be in the normal recurrent funding package of the budget for the department of primary industries supplemented by some of the other budgets. Landcare? Yes, there is a very big investment in landcare&mdash;plus some little subsidiary programs that have been lost along the way, like the billion trees program; a huge investment in landcare in recent years, off the primary industries budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about funding and support for the Murray&hyphen;Darling Commission? How many times has the Prime Minister come in here in the last few weeks and talked about the opening of the Torrumbarry weir as part of this great new package for the Murray&hyphen;Darling? The Torrumbarry weir has only been there about 40 years and it has had a bit of a facelift. But he has raced up there and opened it and he has since re&hyphen;opened it about three times in the federal parliament. We have had the feral animal funding program. I can remember John Kerin, the former Labor primary industries minister, answering questions many times in the House about the feral animal strategy, the weed strategy, the farm forestry strategy, and on they go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here they are, out proposing to the rest of Australia the world's greatest environmental package. What it is, though, is a severe cut in the budget of the department of primary industries. You have lost at the table, Minister. You have had a severe cut in your budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of issues that have been addressed in the Senate that I think deserve the attention of the House because we did try to raise them when the bill was last here. One was the trust itself and the fact that it was replacing consolidated revenue funding&mdash;and I have already raised that. The other is the way that these funds are to be applied and who will make the decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did try in the Senate to establish an independent board to ensure that these funds, such as they were, would be applied after careful and coordinated consideration. Unfortunately, the important amendments, as I see them, such as the amendment proposed to establish an independent board, were not successful in the Senate. The objective of a board was obviously to allocate funds in accordance with the purposes that the parliament agreed should be the responsibility of the trust, and with an independent board you perhaps could have guaranteed that people with expertise would be considering the various applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it is now, I think it is almost certain&mdash;although there is an advisory board&mdash;that these decisions will be made on the basis of political need. I think that needs to be outlined every time we discuss this fund because it is very clear from the decisions already made that it has little to do with the environment. These decisions will be made on the basis of the needs of rural Australia&mdash;but only the electoral needs of the National and Liberal parties in rural Australia, not the genuine needs of the environment in rural Australia. For the most part, the minister who has responsibility for the bill in this House will be the one making the decisions and the environment, by and large, will clearly get short shrift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is little indication that there will be any coordination of government policy and the expenditure of funds under these trusts. I note, for example, that decisions have recently been made about woodchipping. We are seeing very significant increases in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4161"> amount of our old growth native forests that are being sacrificed&mdash;and I use the word advisedly&mdash;for low grade woodchips all over the country. What we are seeing is very little value adding and very little value for the community as a whole. The trust apparently aims to replant 250,000 hectares of land in five years and, at the same time, 660,000 hectares of land will be cleared in Australia each year. The government is reneging on its responsibilities for any controls over clearing and woodchipping of native forests is expanding at a rapid rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state, this is a scandal. We are now seeing significant old growth forests being sacrificed for very short&hyphen;term gains. And gains they may not be because the state government is almost certainly subsidising these woodchipping activities. Many will be aware of the very pristine Giblett block in Western Australia. The Giblett block is one that many people have admired over the years. It has, in fact, been interim listed by the Australian Heritage Commission. It is one that deserves to be preserved. Have we heard a word about this very significant area from the federal government? No. Is there a dollar to be spent from this trust fund? Apparently not. Will there be subsidies to exploit it from the state government in Western Australia? Yes. Are taxpayers' dollars funding the export of our very rare native forests? Yes. Is this something that we should all object to? Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It just shows very clearly that this government has no idea at all about environment policy. Yes, you can put money into replanting trees, but why simultaneously knock them down for very short&hyphen;term gain, for which the taxpayers, I might say, are paying? At the moment, there are some very brave people in the forests in Western Australia actually sitting up in trees in cold weather in the south&hyphen;west of the state to try and prevent the state government from chipping these very important areas listed by the Australian Heritage Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A motion has been moved in the Senate supporting these moves to prevent the  woodchipping and the clear&hyphen;felling of this area. Again, what do we hear from the minister? That this is a desirable outcome&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">that our native forests be woodchipped and sent overseas: no value adding, no timber industry development. This is very short&hyphen;term thinking and I think in the long term this fund will be supporting activities that do not support the environment, but that actually lead to its deterioration.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The comments by the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) make a very good introduction for what I wish to speak about&mdash;some of the early amendments, particularly the preamble. One would have thought that, having given such priority to the way in which they articulated the importance of the environment before the election, the coalition would have at least made certain that the preamble to the bill made it clear that the object of the trust was environmental protection and conservation. But they did not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most extraordinary things is that the bill did not provide that the trustees&mdash;those obliged to have regard to the objects of the bill&mdash;had to actually act in the interests of conservation and the environment. One might have thought that was simply an oversight until one reflects on the idea that the 1967 referendum is now being seen by the government not as the vote of the Australian people regarding the power to make laws for the benefit of Aboriginal people, rather it is to be construed as the power to make laws which may disadvantage Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without guiding principles in the preamble, it was entirely possible that those with management responsibility of the fund could have consistently, with the objects of the bill, gone off on frolics of their own&mdash;not only pork&hyphen;barrelling specific areas for electoral advantage, but doing so without regard for the environment. In other words, it would not just have been a big barrel of pork, it would have been non&hyphen;environmental pork. The non&hyphen;environmental pork was signalled by the fact that just before this legislation was actually debated, we had the reports that all projects going through this were going to have to go through the government employment committee. The two ministers with the legal responsibility under this bill were going to have to go 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4162"> through that committee in order to vet any initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That really set some alarm bells ringing. The minister said, `No, no. Not so.' But why the reluctance then to build into this legislation a clear mandated objective that the principal objects of the legislation are the protection of the environment and conservation? They are in there now and the eyes of Australia will be on you every moment, because there is no doubt that you will still be answerable to the political masters in that cabinet room in the way in which this is discharged. Anyone who believes that two ministers of the Crown are not mindful of the views of their cabinet colleagues needs to come out of fairyland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go back to the days when Labor was in government, for example, the minister responsible for woodchip licensing was the Minister for Resources, David Beddall. Mr Beddall had the responsibility of making those legal decisions. But no&hyphen;one would pretend he did not take into account the views of his cabinet colleagues; it was acknowledged straightforwardly. But what we have is the pretence that the two ministers who now have the legal responsibility are somehow to sit in a cabinet subcommittee&mdash;which is a political arm of this government&mdash;involve themselves in debates and discussions about the way this fund should operate and then somehow magically distance themselves from the political imperatives and act in a way that is immune from any political pork&hyphen;barrelling. What fancy. You really have to be a bit wet behind the ears to accept that kind of logic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what would have been worse is that, unless these amendments were there, there would have been no criteria against which you could benchmark that conduct. The amendments Nos 1 to 9 that were put in schedule B were very important. Certainly it is true that the accountability regime is still significantly deficient. There is no independent board. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my earlier comments I was developing my argument that this Natural Heritage Trust Fund has not more money for the environment, particularly for rural based environment and

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens when these dollars run out? As I have already said, some of the budget areas of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy have been cut back and some of these program areas have been topped up with money out of the heritage trust. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has already found that the heritage trust has been squeezed too far because he has now taken it out to six years rather than five to string it out a bit further. We all know what happens when you arrive at the ERC and the budget table when the funds have run out from one program and you are starting to put up funding for new policy proposals but you have not got any offsets. Not only will this minister not have any offsets but he has given them all away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You, Minister, at some point down the track, are going to have to remount the case for the money that you have let go as a swap for money from the sale of Telstra. There is an obvious area where this might come from: flogging off more of Telstra. You have already made it clear that that is your party's intention. But it is a poor strategy on the part of a minister to accept that your budget is being eaten away without any real picture of where you are going to get those funds back from when you come back with these policy proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the money now; it is actually the loss. I will tell you where else the losses have been. Built into Labor's $4 billion One Nation labour market package was a huge allocation over a number of years to rural and regional projects. For instance, LEAP&mdash;and I remind the minister that LEAP stood for landcare and environment action program; a jobs program for young people in the 16 to 21 age group&mdash;had thousands and thousands of young people working in this field for several years. That is what I am talking about as an investment in a landcare and environment action program, as well as the developing of skills for those people. It has gone. What has it been replaced with?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not intend to enter this debate, but the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), made it imperative to make a few brief remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, there is a serious factual mistake in the comments of the previous speaker, and that is the assertion that there is not a training component. There is, in fact, a very extensive training component in Green Corps. All Green Corps participants will emerge with one or two landcare certificates and other training that will be provided by accredited TAFE trainers. So the fact is that there is a very  serious training component of the Green Corps program, and that was always some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thing that was integral to the program as designed by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other key difference which the previous speaker should have alluded to is that Green Corps is made up of volunteers. The difference between Green Corps and LEAP is that the LEAP participants were conscripts; Green Corps participants are volunteers. There is an enormous difference between Green Corps and work for the dole. Green Corps is an environmental program for young people. Green Corps is a job. It is a job lasting for six months at the national training wage. It is a real job, working on real environmental problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that the reports I have from ATCV and the other people involved in the Green Corps projects confirm that the work that is being done by the Green Corps teams is simply magnificent. I do not deprecate for a moment the good work that was put in by many people working on LEAP schemes. Many of the people involved in LEAP schemes worked extremely hard, and I would not for a second say that there were no useful outcomes from the LEAP schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that the reports the government has suggest that Green Corps is very much a quantum leap ahead of the LEAP program because of the fact that these people are volunteers. They are not conscripts. They are not slave labourers. They are not there because they have been threatened with the loss of any benefit. They are there because they want to be there. They are there because they are people genuinely committed to Australia and genuinely committed to our environment. This is something which members opposite should realise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested that the member for Warringa (Mr Abbott) was stung into some sort of activity on that question because it is a very important issue. The LEAP programs were very substantially cut in order to substitute these much smaller programs. While they may have value for the very few who can take part in them, it is clearly much less than the community expected, given what they had already experienced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my local government area, for example&mdash;there are several local governments that fall within my electorate&mdash;they are not getting a brass razoo, not a cent, not a person being employed, conscripted or otherwise. I note that the member for Warringa seems to be concerned about the notion of conscription. I have some sympathy with that view, but the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) does not appear to. He is running around the country talking about the importance of working for the dole. So there seems to be a little split in the ideology on the other side&mdash;a split that I welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to speak very briefly about another very significant failure in this bill&mdash;even with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the amendments that the Senate has brought forward&mdash;and that is that the bill lacks very important accountability provisions to ensure that the states do not cost shift to the Commonwealth. As a former state Premier, I know how tempting it is, when the Commonwealth offers funds, to remove funds from state expenditure that have formally been applied to that purpose. There is nothing in this legislation to prevent it. There is no way the Commonwealth government can ensure that these funds will genuinely be new funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a double jeopardy here because the Commonwealth is actually replacing these funds from its own. The consolidated revenue funds are being cut in order that these funds can be spent, so there is a net reduction in some areas. If the state governments start to do that as well, we will see Australia wide a net decline in environment funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign in Western Australia which recently concluded, the Premier said in the lead-up to the election that he was going to undertake this huge salinity program. It was to be without precedent in Australian history. He wrote to the Prime Minister saying that he wanted a slice of the heritage trust fund. Indeed, as I recall, he wanted roughly a third of it. It was rather an ambitious request, even for the usually grandiose Premier of Western Australia. The Prime Minister, not surprisingly, did not indicate that he would provide that sort of funding, but there was a nod and a wink that this would be given some consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To date, there is not a cent. The Western Australian government has this huge promise that it has made to the people of Western Australia to address dry land salinity in particular and salinity in general, which is a huge problem in the agricultural areas of Western Australia&mdash;a problem that is largely the result of agricultural practices undertaken in ignorance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My own father, as a farmer, was one of those who contributed to this problem. In the marginal areas of the wheat belt of Western Australia, it was characteristic of farmers' practices that they would move in there with a couple of bulldozers or with a chain strung between a couple of tractors and just mow 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4165"> down every tree in sight. It was considered reasonable practice. They were encouraged to do it. In fact, there were financial incentives. We are now reaping that harvest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government of Western Australia told the people of Western Australia that it would address this problem and that it would do so with the cooperation of the federal government. To date, there has not even been a whisper that the promise will be met. There is no indication at all from the federal government that it will support this program, which is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one thing is certain: the day the federal government does commit a dollar, there will be a dollar less from the state government in Western Australia. There will be no net improvement in the amount of funding provided to that and other programs, and there is no guarantee in this legislation that that can be so. So that $300 million salinity program, if it ever gets under way and if it is funded by the heritage trust, will be funded, I think, entirely by the heritage trust and not at all by the government of Western Australia, despite its promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also disappointed that this bill does not provide for any leverage over state governments that are undertaking practices that are not environmentally friendly. I have mentioned the Western Australian government where there are not adequate clearing controls, but it is even worse in Queensland. You will be simultaneously providing funding for vegetation programs while allowing the Queensland government to rip and tear into virgin forest areas, reducing the state of the environment to penury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this bill does not do what it could with the amount of financial leverage that is available to it. As a former state Premier, I warn the ministers responsible that, unless they have proper controls here, this will not be a net increase in environmental funding; it will just mean that the Commonwealth pays more.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government has set against one of the most important global issues that we face&mdash;the issue of climate change.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe this government is doing us any service whatsoever in the way it is approaching this task. Firstly, it is criticising even our entry into the Rio process. Secondly, it is blundering about in international relations, setting its face against the process that the developed world has established. It is putting forward the legitimate special interests that Australia has not in a way which would attract support from the international community but in a way which is likely to disadvantage us in those negotiations. Thirdly, it is transparently acting in a way which suggests, not only to Australia but to the rest of the world, that it is not operating from a basis of utmost good faith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is that? It is because almost all greenhouse related areas which could have been properly funded under this trust and which were funded under the environmental programs that the previous government had in place have been cut. Let us go through those things. We find that, at the same time they go ahead with what has now been very accurately portrayed as a deceitful con job on the Australian public, the government have cut funds in key areas that relate to greenhouse. The most important areas where substantial funds have been abolished are the Energy Research and Development Corporation and the national energy efficiency program, both in breach of express coalition election commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the run-up to the 1996 election, Minister Parer personally promised to maintain current support for the Energy Research and Development Corporation and to continue the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development. Instead of maintaining support for the Energy Research and Development Corporation, Senator Parer and the government have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4166"> abolished it. Last year they reduced the research and development tax concession to 125 per cent. Last year, on 16 August, the government said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises the important role renewable energy plays in protecting the environment, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and laying the foundation for long-term, sustainable development . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What do we now find? Senator Parer used the ERDC and the cooperative research centres to claim that position on greenhouse gas reduction, but in addition to abolishing the ERDC the budget sees Commonwealth funding for cooperative research centres slashed by $10 million over two years. So $50 million out of ERDC and $10 million out of the CRC program. Not surprisingly, Warwick Parer has been given last year's low point award for the worst environmental performance of any Australian minister. What a strange process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Picking up on the comments of the shadow minister for primary industry, instead of proceeding with programs that would see the continuation of landcare programs, the continuation of the LEAP programs and the continuation of the billion trees programs, they have all gone. There has been some substitution, but, in net effect, there are less in terms of reafforestation and creation of greenhouse sinks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can our government go to the international community and say, `We are treating in good faith,' when we are retreating from the very things that would give us the opportunity to meet those greenhouse targets? We are not establishing programs that will actually rebuild our vegetative ground cover, not doing the things for energy efficiency, and allowing land clearance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister is claiming all the jobs that are going to be created from the investment in the Natural Heritage Trust, my friend. Don't you listen to him? And all the jobs you are going to be handing out with your handouts from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's just ask how it is going to be funded. How is it going to be funded? The sale of Telstra&mdash;what has already been publicly stated by all parties, with no denial&mdash;the consequence: 22,000 jobs to be shed in Telstra. And where are those jobs going to be shed? They are going to be shed in rural and regional Australia. Because we knew, during our whole period in government, that every time Telstra wanted to downsize for competition, it was going to be in the CSO area&mdash;in the community service obligations in the rural areas, because that is where it is unprofitable. That is where you cannot make the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is a privatised Telstra going to do? It is going to shed jobs in the country towns. If the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) does not understand now the effect in country towns of this taking out of jobs&mdash;particularly in the public sector&mdash;he just has not been there and has not even been listening to his own people. It will be a re&hyphen;run of the Commonwealth Bank. The minute we sold the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;and I am the first to admit this&mdash;we lost control over telling them where they stayed open; where 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4167"> they kept the people. What has been the impact in Australia's country towns? Not just the Commonwealth Bank but all the other banks have pulled their services out&mdash;along with the Medicare offices and all the rest of it&mdash;right where the jobs are most needed. That, of course, will be the case with Telstra, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So here is part of the hoax: we are floating Telstra, we are raising this $8 billion, we are going to do all these wonderful things for it in rural and regional Australia; it is the saviour of the bush. Oh, but by the way, to fund it we are standing by and watching while they shed 22,000 jobs&mdash;most of which will be in your towns and areas. That is the private sector at work. That is good for Australia and somehow it is good for rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this Natural Heritage Trust and all the fanfare that has been built around the sale of it&mdash;even those letters from the councils along the Murray River accusing us of holding their Murray&hyphen;Darling 2000 package at ransom because we were holding up the Telstra bill&mdash;are now going to be exposed. And what is going to be exposed is that this is just another plank&mdash;albeit a significant one&mdash;in what will become known widely as the coalition's great rural hoax.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was pointing out the failure to fund things you would expect to be funded in a serious environmental statement. If this was not a con, you would expect that you would have been able to have resources provided so that the government would be able to fund energy efficiency programs. It would not be retreating from its greenhouse commitments in revegetation. It would be doing something about land clearance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might also expect, if they were genuine and serious about the environment, that they would not be telling the Environmental Defender's Offices all around Australia that they are not allowed to sue a government any more; that they are not allowed to litigate. You set up an agency charged with the responsibility of acting in the interests of the environment&mdash;or rather, the Labor government sets up such an agency&mdash;and what does  the coalition government do in expressing this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> great concern for the environment? It sends them a letter saying, `We are not going to be able to take any litigation. If we breach our own rules about the environment, we are not going to be able to litigate.' In other words: we want an immunity from scrutiny; we do not want to be watched as we go about distributing our slush fund as we choose; we do not want to be held to account by the laws that we purport to enforce; we do not want to have any external scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also mention one other thing you might expect if this government were serious about the environment. You might expect that there would be adequate funding to complete the RFA processes, which this government has held up as such an important element of a national strategy. You might expect that there would be funding, for example, in Tasmania, where the process may fall short at the last hurdle because there are not sufficient resources to address the problem of making certain that the 15 per cent target of pre&hyphen;existing forestation can be met without providing some funding for private landowners. But there is nothing in this process for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite promising, with great fanfare, that the fund would be additional to Labor's budgeted funding, the reality is that budget cuts to the environment department mean that Telstra money will be used to replace funds that were previously committed from consolidated revenue. The environment budget, announced two weeks ago, was a massive con. It effectively tears asunder the fabric of the government's electoral mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To meet its Natural Heritage Trust election promise, last week's budget should have delivered $433 million for the trust fund and the environment department's budget. Instead, it allocated only $350 million&mdash;a shortfall of nearly 20 per cent. It has rebadged existing programs and put them under the Natural Heritage Trust banner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the trust alone, as I have mentioned, in the first two years&mdash;against the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> documents which the now Treasurer, Peter Costello, announced as the benchmark for their charter of honesty&mdash;it is $83 million short.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4168">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has no excuse. The legislative framework has now been changed by the Senate. This fund must be expended over five years. It has no excuse for not bringing forward additional funding for those first two years so that they can meet those commitments that will be necessary to meet the greenhouse challenge; so that it can do those things that are necessary to enable the RFA processes to complete successfully; so that it can actually go somewhere near the benchmark that it set for itself. But it will not, because this is a government of deceit. It is a government that has fronted up to the Australian people, sold them a pup, tried to sell the Senate a pup by a deceitful tactical manoeuvre, been caught out, and is still trying to con the Australian public through this mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funds are being used to replace programs that have been funded from consolidated revenue. Well established environmental programs have been rebadged. For example, save the bush, national corridors of green, one billion trees, grassland ecology and other programs have been axed or rebadged as bush care and then marketed as though they were new programs funded with Telstra money. In conclusion, what we actually have is a government that has failed to meet its own benchmarks. We are not asking for a commitment to any higher objective than that which it established for itself to meet. But it fell so short of that hurdle that it has not even got off the ground. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I had occasion to describe it in the National Press Club last week as a budget that not even its mother could love. I think the reasons are very obvious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a budget, first of all, that did precisely nothing and seemed to care even less for jobs&mdash;the country's most overwhelming current economic and social problem. It was a budget that did nothing for savings, abandoning the best chance that we have ever had or ever will have to build a huge new private savings pool and to do so in a way that would have guaranteed a decent retirement income for future generations of lower and middle income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a budget that continued, through the pharmaceutical benefits cuts, the housing cuts, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the child care cuts and the changes, for example, to children's disability eligibility, the ugly assault on families, the elderly and the needy which was begun on such a dramatic scale last year. It was a budget that had more than its fair share of mindless and counterproductive savings initiatives affecting the quality and decency of life in this country and our international reputation&mdash;for example, the cuts to the ABC and Radio Australia, cuts to the aid program, cuts to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the author of the stolen children report, the cuts to Abstudy and the various other bits and pieces of the Hansonite agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a budget that, even with all its cuts, did not meet in fact the exaggerated expectations it had created as to the size of its deficit reduction achievements and projected future surpluses. So it was marked down accordingly even by the financial markets that the government had sought so desperately to woo. It was a budget which even the government's best business friends characterised as lacking in shape, direction and any sense of vision.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4172"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let me begin in talking about this budget with its contribution to savings which the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has said on multiple occasions over the last two weeks is the central theme and the central achievement of this budget. He cannot be very thrilled with the reception that it has been given on this front&mdash;many commentators making clear their concern. Ross Gittins, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  on 14 May, belled the cat most succinctly when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This budget is a confidence track. It purports to be all about increasing national savings, but in fact it will reduce them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those criticisms have been very well founded. Let us look at the arithmetic for a start. The Treasurer's headline surplus has been achieved essentially by windfall gains through selling off more than $10 billion worth of public assets, reducing public debt, yes, and public debt interest obligations, yes, but making, as economists would recognise, a zero contribution to national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His underlying surplus of $1.6 billion, to be achieved by 1998-99, is to be realised as follows. There is $330 million from a one-off windfall gain from a timing change to withholding tax payment arrangements, dressed up as a major benefit to small business but in fact only benefiting the very smallest businesses; most of those with more than four employees are in fact being left out in the cold. Three hundred and ten million dollars of it is a public debt interest saving, the largest part of which comes from the government's last minute decision to force Telstra to take on  another $3 billion in debt, putting pressure on future telephone charges&mdash;as we are seeing already with indications of new 013 charges&mdash;and not improving national saving one iota. The sum of $267 million is from additional property sales in 1998-99, allowed to be counted by a technical loophole in the definition of `net advances'. So much for Mr Costello's claim in January that he had ended `forever the last minute asset sales to mask the true state of the accounts'. Of course, the final $729 million is achieved by the government breaking its superannuation co&hyphen;contribution promise in a way which will diminish&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">as I will explain in a moment&mdash;rather than massively enhance the national savings pool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that the overall deficit reduction and surplus creating outcomes have been achieved by straight&hyphen;out outlays reductions, as distinct from these other various windfalls I have just described, that was far more the achievement of the decisions made in last year's budget than those made in this one. That is another reason that the budget received such a lacklustre reception, to put it politely, from the financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hasten to add that, from the opposition perspective, this is not one of the criticisms that we make of this budget. We thought last year's slashing was far too draconian, both in its specific impacts on jobs, on support for families and on good public policy generally and in its overall contractionary impact on the economy, taking half a per cent at least off the growth that was otherwise achievable last year and next. Again, although the cuts and the slashes in this year's budget were certainly bad enough, we think that the government's continued obsession with budget deficit reduction and its obsession with improving national saving through reducing public dissaving in this way represents simply misguided priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International comparisons I think continue to be instructive in this respect. At least the government has been shamed into putting some of them back into the budget papers after omitting them last year. I am talking in particular about comparative public debt and government deficit statistics, because this indicates perhaps better than anything else the misguided nature of the government's slashing and burning enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Europe, honourable members will be aware, the Maastricht convergence criteria for good economic housekeeping for economic monetary union in Europe do set some maximum limits as to what is permissible, with 60 per cent of GDP being the maximum permissible public debt and three per cent being the maximum permissible government deficit across the country. Of course, efforts to meet those criteria for monetary union have been causing massive political and social unrest in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4173"> a number of European countries at the moment, most obviously last weekend with the first round French assembly elections producing for many people the unexpected result of a massive protest vote against the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is only one European country&mdash;Luxembourg&mdash;which meets those criteria at the moment in full. But Australia easily meets them. Australia bolts it in. We have at the moment around 40 per cent gross public debt, compared with the European average of 78 per cent. We have less than one per cent of GDP in budget deficits, with that figure likely to come down further in the years ahead. The message from the opposition about all this has been exactly the same every time we have said it since the election. Yes, the budget balances are, over the course of the economic cycle, a worthy objective, other things being equal. But it is not an objective that should be manically pursued if larger problems are going unredressed, or if to pursue manic budget deficit reduction objectives is in manifest conflict with other more sensible economic priorities and, in particular in our situation at the moment, with reducing the utterly unacceptable and tragic close to nine per cent unemployment rate which continues to apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government's performance in deficit reduction was much more successful than the coalition's if you look at it in straight&hyphen;out dollar terms. We took $6.8 billion off the deficit in our last two years in office. The coalition has managed to take off only $6.4 billion in its first two budgets. We did make a big fiscal consolidation effort, but the main reason we got there and the main reason we achieved those outcomes was our much greater concentration and focus on growing the economy. The priority that is sensibly given to growth in this situation is something I will come back to in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centrepiece of the government's budget is the so-called savings rebate. It is worth while spelling out in just a little bit of detail what an ill thought out, valueless, half&hyphen;baked exercise it was to replace the co&hyphen; contribution scheme with the so-called savings rebate. In the first place, its impact on total national saving is bound to end up negative. That is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because the rebate rewards those with existing savings&mdash;even if they run down during the course of the year&mdash;rather than those making new ones, and the government rebate itself is far more likely to be spent than saved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That contrasts with the Labor Party's co&hyphen;contribution scheme, which the coalition itself previously embraced, whereby the $4.5 billion that we were going to spend on government superannuation contributions, matched as it had to be by the three per cent wage earners contribution, would have provided a net gain to national savings of close to that full amount. That would have translated over the period to 2020 into a $400 billion addition to the national savings pool. Under this government's savings rebate scheme, that amount simply disappears. So much for reducing our foreign debt, so much for reducing our dependence on foreign investment, so much for being better able to buy back the farm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second place, the new savings rebate is not going to make any effective contribution to people's long-term retirement income packages. Under the co-contribution scheme someone now on average weekly earnings aged 35 would be collecting an additional retirement benefit of $110,000. That disappears under the government's savings rebate scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the third place, the savings rebate scheme is full of anomalies and inequities. How can it contribute to the development of a savings `culture' in this country when you can get it by not adding to your saving? Why was the system designed so that not one of the 1.3 million full rate aged and service pensioners can get the rebate, even if they have income on their savings of up to $2,500, while any taxpayer earning that amount on his or her savings would get a rebate of $375?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why was it designed to enable business income earned as a sole trader or through a partnership or trust to count for the rebate provided only it is not described as wages or salary? Why should it be possible for a wealthy family to distribute its saving income through a family trust structure to, say, five tax paying members of the family, each of them getting the maximum $450 rebate? What 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4174"> is the comparative merit of a scheme which means that an ordinary worker paying $1,000 in personal superannuation contributions will get $150 from the rebate whereas under the co-contribution scheme there would have been a matching contribution of fully $1,000?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many low to middle income earners can afford to pay personal superannuation contributions of $3,000 a year, or $58 a week, to get the full benefit of the rebate? How many of them have the $60,000 in savings in the bank or elsewhere that would be the other way of getting the full $450?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can it be just for high income earners&mdash;the great majority of whom are paying more than $3,000 into superannuation already or who already have more than $60,000 in other savings&mdash;to be getting the rebate? Why on earth did John Howard, the Prime Minister, say that it would be `stupid' and `crazy' for there to be a means test on the rebate when his own pre-election savings document promised a means test on any savings incentive that the coalition introduced?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no exaggeration to say that the coalition savings rebate&mdash;which can, at the end of the day, be characterised as nothing more than a windfall tax cut for those who do not need it&mdash;is one of the worst designed, most indefensible and cynical pieces of public policy making in the financial history of this country. It is lousy economics, lousy social policy and lousy morality. The government will properly stand condemned for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I want to say about the savings rebate is to contest the proposition  that somehow a unique initiative is being introduced by this government, that there has not previously been anything which operates as an incentive for saving. That is palpable nonsense and let me tell you why. There has been a whole series of savings tax incentives introduced by Labor over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make a list of the major ones. For a start, every reduction in marginal tax rates reduces the tax rates on savings. Labor massively reduced the rates of income tax applying at all income levels with the largest proportion of cuts being the basic rate of tax 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reduced from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. Again, the value of the assistance to saving via superannuation increased dramatically under Labor from around $2.37 billion in 1983&hyphen;84 to $6.3 billion in 1995-96. We not only massively increased the amount of assistance to this form of savings but significantly increased the availability of superannuation to the general public, thus making the tax expenditure here a lot fairer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A system of full dividend imputation introduced by Labor is delivering around $3 billion worth of tax reductions to savings through shares. That is not providing some kind of rort, but it is ending the previous system of double taxation of company income which previously applied. Full tax is paid on company income, but double tax is eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Division 7 tax was abolished in 1986, delivering hundreds of millions of dollars in savings per year to those small businesses who were allowed to save and reinvest their earnings instead of having to distribute them and hence pay personal tax to top up the company tax already paid. Again, the management and investment companies scheme provided a tax deduction for savings in venture capital companies. Even though that scheme was ultimately terminated, that provided the catalyst for the current venture or development capital industry that is now starting to flourish in Australia. So let us hear no more of that nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I focused on the savings question because the Treasurer has made so much of it. The other very big point to make about this budget is the utter inability of this budget to deal with the question of jobs&mdash;job creation, job security. Let me say very briefly, because I have said all this before in the MPI debate in this place the day after the budget, that if we are going to create the jobs necessary to significantly and quickly reduce unemployment to less tragic levels in this country there has to be at least five major strategies adopted. Not one of those strategies is given appropriate support in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing you have to do, which this budget did not, is grow internal demand by growing the economy as a whole at a faster 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4175"> rate. Unless you do get it coming in at over four per cent, that simply will not create the preconditions that everybody now agrees are necessary for significant unemployment reduction. Instead, you have another contractionary budget, another series of expenditure cuts, which actually reduces jobs rather than creates them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About the only contribution to growth overall that the budget made was to shame the Reserve Bank into making a compensatory further reduction in interest rates last week. This was not a matter, as the Prime Minister keeps saying, of the budget being so great as to make the interest rate cut possible. Rather, it is because the budget was so bad that interest rate cut was desperately necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing any job creating strategy has to do is link Australia into external demand through properly supported and properly funded trade and external affairs policy. You do not do that by cutting departmental and Austrade resources. You do not do it by removing the funding and killing the National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference, which this budget has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing, and a very big thing, the budget should have done for jobs but did not was to provide major support to translate generalised demand into specific business and job opportunities through carefully crafted industry policy and regional development policy. There is no such thing as industry policy under this government. It has now been abandoned. There is no such thing as regional policy. The budget systematically continues the task begun last year of hacking away at those crucial props.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth thing the budget has to do for jobs each year but did not do on this occasion when it was so desperately necessary is to reverse the damage that has been done to education, to training, to job readiness programs. Labour market programs have been cut to pieces. It is just desperately damaging to have further cuts on top of that to vocational education, to abolish the Commonwealth industry places scheme, to generally display a total lack of interest that this budget does in getting these things right.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next and last thing the budget needs to do in this situation is provide more resources for the creation of a publicly funded pool of essentially transitional community service jobs to try to absorb, at least for the time it takes other strategies to effectively bite, some of that large group of people whose skills are going to be in less demand and who need that kind of support. Killing LEAP, offering a few hundred places by way of compensation in the Green Corps and offering 10,000 opportunities to work for the dole is no substitute for providing meaningful and rewarding work, the training that goes with it and some sense of security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basic difference between the government and the opposition on all of this is that we have a different idea of the bottom line. It is not just the accountant's bottom line; it is the human bottom line. There has to be something about the view from Kirribilli and the view from Toorak and Malvern that simply stops the Prime Minister and the Treasurer from seeing that human bottom line. Above all, they seem to have failed utterly to understand how serious is the human plight of those 800,000 Australians who want to work but who presently cannot and who have been utterly demoralised over the last year to see their chances of work getting no better but in fact getting worse. If the government does not want to accept the responsibilities of leadership, it ought to step aside for a party that demonstrably can and will. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened very attentively to what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) had to say. According to him, everything in the budget is wrong&mdash;the direction is wrong, the vision is wrong. Here we saw a former senior minister of the former government with not a single hint of contriteness in his address. We were left with a huge foreign debt and a $10.3 billion budget deficit. On top of that, the credit rating of Australia was downgraded 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4176"> not just once but twice in the final six years of the former Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now about nine months since the new Howard-Fischer government brought down the first coalition government budget in 13 years, generally seen as a tough but fair budget. The plan of action was then detailed to redress the years of Hawke-Keating Labor government budgets that pursued a policy of deficit and debt, a policy that saw little inclination to take tough decisions in the long-term interests of our nation and a policy that resulted in Australia's overseas debt blowing out to unheard of proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That policy also resulted in a Commonwealth general net debt in excess of $93 billion, a budget deficit of more than $10 billion and Australia having to suffer the ignominy and shame, for the first time in our nation's history, of being downgraded by the world's major credit rating agencies from our AAA credit rating not just once but twice in the last six years of that government. Deficit and debt are the hallmarks of the legacy of Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that in its last five years the former Labor government ran up $70 billion in deficits, averaging $17 billion a year. Treasurer Costello has turned a $10.3 billion deficit around to a surplus in 1998-99 of $1.6 billion. The Treasurer has set the scene in this plan for a steady, decades&hyphen;long growth&mdash;no more of the boom and bust of Labor with the recession we `had to have'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget provides the framework for steady growth, low inflation, low interest rates, Commonwealth outlays at pre-Whitlam levels and a budget in surplus, with a growing economy at 3&frac34; per cent and perhaps even higher. Just as importantly, this will obviate  the need to borrow this year or next year on the long road to repaying our debt. In other words, we are at last beginning to pay our way through a reduction in spending instead of a lifting of revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only will the Commonwealth not be borrowing, but in fact the process of repaying our debt has begun&mdash;a debt left to us through the former Labor administration's mismanagement of the Australian economy. The repay 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment of the debt will be at the impressive rate of $5 billion in the coming financial year, with a further $5 billion the following year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, for the first time in more than a decade the Commonwealth is going to tax savings less, and the tax system is going to be biased in favour of savings. National savings have fallen steadily for the past 13 or so years. As a result, investments which create jobs and improve the socioeconomic standards of our society have exponentially dried up. The cornerstone of the Howard-Costello financial strategy is the increasing of national savings through an increase of public savings. It remains an undeniable fact that, even though we form part of the global economy&mdash;in particular I refer to the capital markets&mdash;those nations whose people save money have higher levels of business investment than nations whose people do not. Domestic savings that are clearly identifiable are exactly what Australia needs to advance economic growth and reverse unemployment trends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is a highlight to the budget, a point of emphasis, then it must be in reference to savings. In the recession, the one we `had to have', the rate of national savings as a percentage of GDP was at a very low 16 per cent. That has steadily improved since the Howard government came to power on 2 March 1996 to about 18 per cent currently. However, even that improvement leaves us well short of the 25 per cent of GDP experienced in the 1950s and 1960s, which is the level we have to aim for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The savings rebate contained in the budget goes some of the way to redressing the injustice felt especially by self-funded retirees. The bulk of self-funded retirees are people who have sacrificed all their lives to not become a burden on governments when they retire. Many, if not most, retire on fixed incomes and have to rely on their investment and/or superannuation just to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a rebate on interest on bank account savings, superannuation contributions, share dividends, and also on rents from properties. That rebate will be at the rate of 15 per cent on savings worth up to $450 a year on taxable income from savings of up to a maximum of $3,000. These measures will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4177"> be brought in over two stages, with a 7&half; per cent redebate from 1 July 1998 and the full rebate from 1 July 1999. The major incentive to savings in this budget is the fact that the government is strenuously setting about the task of repairing years of mismanagement by returning the underlying budget balance to a sufficient surplus to meet the accruing costs of government initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment, which is forecast to go down to about eight per cent, continues to be Australia's major economic and social problem. However, that level, if attained&mdash;and I am confident that it will be&mdash;will be the lowest level for the past eight years. The Howard coalition government in the past year has created 130,000 new jobs, and the forecast in this year's budget is for 200,000 additional jobs. The coalition government's plan of action with a budget surplus in 1998-99, the underlying inflation rate at only two per cent&mdash;one of the lowest in the world&mdash;and interest rates at their lowest for more than a quarter of a century puts the Howard government well on target for a reduction of unemployment to under eight per cent by the middle of next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other good news I want to refer to is the Commonwealth general government net debt which is set to fall from over 19 per cent of GDP in 1995&hyphen;96 to under 10.5 per cent in the years 2000-2001&mdash;a huge turnaround, almost halving our public debt levels as a percentage of our GDP that has restricted our economic growth prospects. That, if it were left unaddressed, would have resulted in many future generations of Australians having to shoulder the debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the issue of the family and what is being done to assist them primarily through the $1 billion family tax initiative,  which is beginning to provide substantial assistance for low and middle income families. Additionally, on 1 July this year, the $450 rebate on the cost of private health insurance will come into effect. The new initiatives announced in this budget by the Treasurer will further assist families in need, especially some of the most disadvantaged&mdash;and I refer specifically to those who look after 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> elderly relatives and/or children with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The domiciliary nursing care benefit will be aligned from 1 July 1998 with the child disability allowance to assist carers who provide home based care as against nursing home care, with an extra $16.60 per fortnight. Also effective from 1 July 1998, those caring for children under the age of 16 with severe disabilities will become eligible for carer payment. This means that a full-time carer will be eligible to receive up to $347.80 per fortnight. Further, additional funding of $54 million spread over four years will be provided under the Commonwealth-state disability agreement for additional support for accommodation for people with severe disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn now specifically to two coalition plans, which are visionary: the first, through the Natural Heritage Trust, has the potential to largely repair the destruction successive generations have inflicted on our environment; and the second, through the Federation Fund, looks to the future for the celebration of our centenary of federation. The Natural Heritage Trust is provided with $1&frac14; billion to fund the largest ever rescue operation, with the greatest possible urgency, for our greatest national inheritance&mdash;and that is the environment&mdash;to save our rivers, vegetation and land. The Federation Fund will consist of $1 billion to fund projects of special national importance in commemoration of the forthcoming centenary celebrations of our federation, which occurred on 1 January 1901.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In March 1996 the coalition inherited Labor's legacy: $10,000 million of deficit. We also inherited Labor's legacy of $70,000 million of public debt. The good news in this year's budget is that, by 1998-99, the $10.3 billion deficit will turn into a $1.6 billion  surplus. We as a country are now paying our way. The good news is that Australia is finally in a position where we are repaying our debts. In the coming financial year, we will pay back over $5 billion of debt, setting the scene for stable economic growth and confidence.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you about growth and confidence. It is 12 months since I first alerted this parliament to the potential of Townsville, Australia's largest tropical city. In the last year Townsville has surged ahead and has, I believe, a future brighter than any other Australian city. Confidence, expectation and action is everywhere&mdash;in industry, in commerce, in sport and in development. This confidence is built on a city and its people who recognise the opportunities ahead, people who are progressive, people who have a strong sense of community spirit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I am proud to report about Townsville, the fastest growing regional area in the Commonwealth. Take, for example, Townsville's newest industry created in the last year: the sports and entertainment industry; an industry that is putting our city squarely and continually in the national spotlight. In football, our team, the North Queensland Cowboys, naturally play in the Super League. This has given us Stockland Stadium, a ground that is as good as any facility in Australia. It has brought the World Nines rugby league tournament to Townsville. The game boasts the biggest football crowds outside the Broncos in Australia. Talking of the Broncos, they could not beat us last weekend in Brisbane. The Cowboys held them to a 20&hyphen;all draw on their home ground. Great work, team!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In basketball, the Townsville Suns are burning up the National Basketball League. They are currently placed at a very credible third in the league competition. More than that, the Townsville team holds an Australian professional record of 58 consecutive home game sell&hyphen;outs. Every home game attracts 4,500 fans to the Townsville Entertainment Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state government budget today provided the funds to expand the capacity of the Entertainment Centre to some 6,000 seats. That is another $11 million into the Townsville economy and a further sign of confidence. In local basketball, work is also well under way on the $1.5 million upgrade to the Murray sporting complex.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4179">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past year, not one but two new power stations have been confirmed for Townsville. Initially, they will operate with LPG gas fuel but later they will likely be fed from a gas pipeline planned to bring the Chevron oil project gas from the Gulf of Papua all the way to Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Construction of the new $55 million minerals berth at the Townsville port is also well under way. This will service the export of the BHP Cannington project, the largest zinc deposit in the world. Also this year the port has recorded its ninth consecutive year of record trade, handling more than seven million tonnes of cargo. The Townsville Port Authority has also been proactive in moving to establish a new road/rail services port access corridor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pandora</EMPHASIS> dream was realised this year with the state government's firm commitment to the $17 million museum project. This was a coup for Townsville and will house the priceless <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pandora</EMPHASIS> shipwreck collection. At Townsville airport, international flights resumed to New Guinea. Milne Bay Air is servicing Townsville&mdash;one of the three international airports in Queensland. There has also been a growing business in fly in, fly out operations to the mines in north&hyphen;west Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">James Cook University in Townsville continues to lead the world in marine science, sports science and earth science. That is right: I said that it leads the world in marine science, sports science and earth science. They garnered a whopping slice of the funding pie from the Australian Research Council large grants program announced last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was concerned last year when I became aware that the project to provide a new northern gateway to the city&mdash;long promised by the previous government&mdash;had not been signed off, despite their assurances to the contrary. It took a lot of hard work but, with the outstanding support of the northern beach es community, Townsville secured the funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I had the honour of moving the first soil on the new roadworks site. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commencement of these roadworks means a lot to Townsville, much more than the $21 million cost of the project. It has been talked about and discussed for years. That, in the end, was the problem. There was lots of talk, lots of promises but no action from the former government. Finally, the Howard coalition government has put action into all the words and all the promises. We have done that in our first year in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Woolcock Street project will create about 100 jobs in the twin cities of Townsville and Thuringowa, and will pave the way for further roadworks in the future, particularly in improving the flood immunity of the Bruce Highway. The Townsville region is also seeing action in major coastal developments. The Oyster Point or Port Hinchinbrook project suffered from years of indecision and inaction on the part of the former government. It took the Howard government to say yes to Port Hinchinbrook and, in doing so, yes to jobs and regional development in North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Magnetic Island, I have been working hard behind the scenes to clear the way for the Nelly Bay Harbour project. Again, lack of leadership by the ALP forced years of delay on the project. We will deliver. The latest research shows that 82.7 per cent of our city supports the all&hyphen;weather harbour. Coalition governments at both state and federal levels are strongly behind the completion of the development. This is good news for Magnetic Island residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you believed the comments of the opposition and the CPSU of late about the Public Service and Townsville, you would probably think the Public Service in Townsville has been gutted, but you would be wrong. In February this year, I had the pleasure of securing and then announcing 50 new jobs for Townsville's Department of Social Security teleservice centre. This was a major win for Townsville and, in particular, the Townsville City Heart business district.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Townsville DSS teleservice centre will have doubled in staff numbers by September 1997, generating an estimated extra $1.5 million in additional wages in the City Heart 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4180"> area. The CPSU's Patrick Meikle would like the Townsville City Heart traders and his union members to believe that these 50 jobs are under threat and have not been budgeted for. I say to the Townsville City Heart small business men and women and to all CPSU members in Townsville that Mr Meikle is 100 per cent wrong. These jobs have been signed and sealed, and they will be delivered in full by the end of September. These 50 new jobs reflect the important role the Australian Public Service plays in Townsville and, in particular, reinforce the importance of Townsville as the major service centre in North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the Australian Defence Force, which also plays a major role in Townsville. Indeed, I would almost go so far as to say that the ADF is Townsville in many ways. Townsville is home to Australia's largest defence base and the operational defence force. Over the last 14 months the federal government has been investing heavily in the ADF in Townsville. In the next 12 months these investments will increase troop numbers in the city, create and sustain a substantial number of jobs, create a bonanza of subcontracting opportunities for local businesses and inject millions of dollars into the local economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) announced Boeing Australia as the preferred tenderer for the ADF's new high frequency communications network system. The system will comprise new ground stations located in four centres across Australia. Of course, one of these centres is Townsville. I spoke with the Department of Defence about the impact of this project for Townsville. Defence estimates a flow-on effect of about $15 million into the Townsville economy in the form of jobs, equipment, software development, testing and systems support and management over the following years. The opportunity for local Townsville businesses to benefit through subcontracting arrangements is significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An estimated $14.3 million is to be spent this financial year on continuing construction 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and associated work tied to the relocation of 10 Terminal Regiment to Townsville. Upon completion of the project an estimated $26 million will have been spent relocating that regiment in Townsville, on the Ross River, bringing about a further 200 service personnel into the city. The flow-on effect to the local economy of this number of additional wage earners and their families coming to Townsville is enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ADF's helicopter fleet at RAAF Base Townsville will also start to receive new facilities this year. The construction of the $21 million helicopter shelters and wash facilities for 5 Aviation Regiment&mdash;the Black Hawk regiment&mdash;is expected to start in about three months time. Again, this project will generate jobs and work for local subcontractors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition spokesman for defence said earlier this year that the coalition had sold out the ADF in Townsville as a result of the defence efficiency review. Despite the whole focus of the DER redirecting resources to the operational, sharp end of the ADF&mdash;and it does not get any sharper than in Townsville&mdash;the opposition claimed the DER would lead to reductions in uniform numbers in the city. Townsville, however, does not share the opposition's view on this. On 16 May the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin </EMPHASIS>ran an article saying that, as a result of the DER recommendations, the RAAF's presence in Townsville could be significantly enhanced. This has been confirmed to me tonight in speaking with the Minister for Defence. The article by Colleen Davis states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Townsville's No 35 Squadron RAAF could more than double in size when replacement aircraft for the Caribou are delivered, according to military and government sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is already being made for accommodation for up to 100 extra families in Townsville/Thuringowa and for expanded facilities at the RAAF Base for the squadron.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accommodation is in addition to 100 houses needed for 10 Terminal Regiment and Army Maritime School families, who will move to Townsville in January (1998). 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4181"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The recommendation that a light tactical aircraft element be established in Townsville, replacing the Caribou aircraft at the end of their operational life, stems directly from the defence efficiency review. If this recommendation is adopted it will be a significant boost for the RAAF in Townsville and to the local economy. Indeed, separate from the DER, a further two Chinook helicopters will be based in Townsville in the next 12 to 18 months. It is expected that about 20 service personnel in the form of flight crew and maintenance teams will also be part of that redeployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial development will also start booming in Townsville from this year on. Sun Metals Corporation will shortly commence construction work on a $530 million zinc refinery very close to the city. The construction phase of this project will create 600 jobs with a following 350 permanent jobs associated with plant operation once operational. And that is only the first part of that project. It will be immediately followed by a separate lead refinery with another investment of about $500 million in that project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Townsville Enterprise Ltd has estimated that the Sun Metals project will create some further 1,600 new jobs as a result of the flow-on effects from the project. Opportunities for local businesses across all sectors will be enormous. The retail trade industry, real estate, hospitality and tourism, the tertiary and higher education sector, the food and beverage industries, the manufacturing and trades industries&mdash;all these different sectors of the Townsville economy will benefit from the Sun Metals zinc refinery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sun Metals have begun recruiting their work force in Townsville, and this process will gain momentum once contracts for earthworks and other construction aspects are begun. In addition, Sun Metals has already held discussions with the Townsville branch of the Barrier Reef Institute of TAFE in regard to the training of employees. Studies conducted by the Centre for Advanced Economic Research and Analysis at James Cook University indicate that about 60 per cent of the work force will be recruited locally and that most of the other 40 per cent will come from within Queensland.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The projects that I have just described sound like a regional Queensland city that is on the move. Indeed, with a 6&half; per cent growth rate, Thuringowa, Townsville's adjoining city, is the fastest growing centre in Queensland. I could easily go on talking about dozens of other development projects in Townsville and Thuringowa. I do not want to give the impression that I walk around Townsville with rose coloured glasses on. Small business is still doing it tough. Unemployment in the Townsville region still remains too high despite having fallen by 2 per cent since the March 1996 election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Howard government has the plan. We have created an environment in the first two budgets which will pave the way for strong and consistent economic growth well into the next decade, in my city and in Australia in general. Townsville is not seeking artificial economic stimulation that cannot be sustained. Townsville is not seeking the artificial labour market programs of old which saw the unemployed cycled through one training program after another with no light at the end of the tunnel in the form of real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud of my city and of what we have been able to achieve. Indeed, I believe that Townsville is a city on the move. The projects I have outlined today, and will continue to outline tomorrow in continuation, are real and they are sustainable. The jobs are there. The 1997 budget has set the scene for stable economic growth and confidence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That funeral was held in St Mary's Anglican Church at Waverley. You, sir, made a very moving speech about Bill Aston and his life. As I was sitting in that delightful church near the sea, my conscience was pricked about a disservice I thought I may have done in the past to a former member of this House who shared the camaraderie of the chair with Bill Aston, you and I. I speak of former Deputy Speaker Joe Clark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Joe Clark was the member for Darling between 1934 and 1969. He was much loved by the people of his electorate. I dare say he served a lot longer in this parliament than you and I probably will. Thirty&hyphen;five years was a long while to serve his people. To serve an electorate such as Darling, which in those days represented probably about a third of the state of New South Wales, was a very hard job to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Joe Clark was loved by the people of Darling and particularly, I am sure, by the people of Coonamble, where he grew up and where his father was the state member. He, indeed, was the local mayor. He was an ALP stalwart, a confidant of former Labor Prime Ministers Curtin and Chifley, and he was the Deputy Speaker of this parliament between 1948 and 1949.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bill Aston died a few weeks ago and Joe Clark died in 1992. When the House dealt with Joe Clark's condolence, as often happens in this place, unfortunately, when members who have not been with us for a long while pass on, no&hyphen;one rose to speak of his life. Indeed, other than the party leaders, when Bill Aston's condolence motion was moved in this House, I think the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) was the only person who had actually served in the House with him who spoke to that condolence motion. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> probably had served with him as well but the rest of us had not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It struck me at the time that we moved the condolence motion for Joe Clark that someone should say something. I mentioned after the condolence motion had been passed by the House a story which I thought was apocryphal about Joe Clark. When read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in the cold light of day, it could also be seen, unfortunately, to be frivolous. I must say that has stuck in my mind for some time. I often thought about correcting it, but as time goes by in this place good intentions often go by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, having listened in that church today to what you said about Bill Aston, and particularly having listened to what Bill Aston's grandchildren said about him, I was reminded again that it was a shame that more was not said about Joe Clark and that I had not put the quote that I made in its correct context. What might have been seen in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to be frivolous was meant to be a very warm reference to Joe Clark which came from an article in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS> and was not a quote of an apocryphal story but a quote by Clark's mentor and great friend Ben Chifley. Chifley remarked upon the distance of Clark's electorate from parliament and from this part of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought at the time when I looked at it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that it could have looked a bit frivolous. In particular, having heard those remarks today by Bill Aston's grandchildren, I thought that if Joe Clark's children ever read that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> they might have felt that. So I thought what I should do tonight is correct the record and make sure that those who might have read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> know it was not a frivolous quote but a very warm and friendly quote from his great friend Ben Chifley.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4182"><TITLE>Crescent Head: Native Title</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to address a problem that concerns the people of Crescent Head in my electorate. Mr Speaker, you will recall that Crescent Head is the one area of Australia where there has been a successful native title claim. You will recall, too, that it was a claim over a number of housing blocks and that when the claim was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4183"> successful the people who were successful in getting the claim did not seek to keep the land; they sold their interest for $1&half; million straightaway. I believe that, in view of the conference on reconciliation that is going on this week, we should be consistent in our awareness of how people really think about things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I happen to believe that those people in my electorate who were successful in their native title claim and then sold their special spiritual interest in and association with the land for a mess of pottage have greatly harmed the rest of Aboriginal Australia because they have demolished the credibility of people who say they have that particular spiritual association with the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Crescent Head Chamber of Commerce, naturally, is very concerned about this. They have gone over the history of that claim as it was made. It should be borne in mind that this is the only successful native title claim in Australia. They think the claim should have been rejected as frivolous. The registrar of the tribunal in Perth was not aware of the extent of the public works that had gone on, bearing in mind that this was unalienated crown land and that these building blocks had already been developed. When the information was given to her it was too late to stop the process. The tribunal went to great lengths to identify parties to the claim and then rejected many people who believed they had a legitimate interest and were financially affected by the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there was no identification of the Aboriginal people making the claim other than a loose description of the Dunghutti tribe. The tribunal did not have names and addresses of these Aboriginal people and apparently made no effort to check the bona fides and family trees of the claimants. The Crescent Head Chamber of Commerce believes that the tribunal made no effort, at any stage, to really investigate the claim and collect relevant facts. People with relevant information on past Aboriginal land use were completely ignored. The tribunal, the Crescent Head people believe, was completely ineffective at the conciliation meetings and no progress was made. Those discussions only 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> resulted in racial divisions that had not been present in the community before this claim was made. I think we have to consider this in the context of all of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Crescent Head Chamber of Commerce is very much of the opinion that the Native Title Act has serious problems. Would you believe it? Of course it does. This is why we are embroiled in this discussion of Wik and the way to solve that problem. It urges the Australian government to change the act so that, in particular, claims are fully investigated before being admitted if there are to be any more claims; so that the claims are properly identified with appropriate family information; so that claimants should have to show a direct and consistent use of the land concerned, rather than it being land they occasionally passed over; and so that land already identified for future urban use, such as necessary housing, as was the case in Crescent Head, should not be available for native title claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may well appear to honourable members that some of the points that the Crescent Head Chamber of Commerce makes may no longer be relevant, depending on what happens. But I want to say to the House, to the Australian parliament, and to the Australian people that I believe the people of Crescent Head make a very valid point indeed and that if there are to be any further land claims then they have to be fair and there has to be consideration of all parties involved. I say to all of the Aboriginal people of Australia: if you are successful in a native title claim, do not sell out.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4183"><TITLE>Australian Capital Territory</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to talk about the ACT&mdash;my community. This government has had a particular attitude to the community that I represent since it came to office. Since that time we have seen nothing but a continual, ideologically&hyphen;driven onslaught on my community. The people who live here expect to be able to work, hold a job and access a reasonable way of life, like anybody else in this country.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4184"> and the members of his government, care not a jot for the families in my community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fear, the insecurity and the lack of vision for a future in this town is taking its toll on those families. I would like to relate a couple of examples which I really think bring this home. I visited a primary school in my electorate last week and I spent an hour with three classes of year 5 students, that is, 10&hyphen; to 11&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. The thing that really upset me was the very first question I was asked by a young year 5 girl, `Will unemployment be all right when I leave school?' The second question was, `How many more public servants are going to lose their jobs?' These were not teacher&hyphen;prompted questions; these were very genuine inquiries from year 5 children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one of my local shopping centres a small family business&mdash;a franchise, in fact&mdash;that has operated there since the centre opened more than eight years ago closed its doors last Sunday. Why? Two reasons: they could not keep going under the economy that they now find themselves living in and they could not continue with the oppressive actions of a powerful landlord. Another small business, in the same centre, is currently working out how it is going to survive. The two partners and their families are desperate. A local restaurant owner in my electorate came to see me two weeks ago. He has been operating for more than eight years in his own right, having taken over a restaurant that had operated for five to six years before that&mdash;a very successful and stable business. His customer levels in the last 12 months have dropped by over 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lending manager in a local bank, whom I had a discussion with yesterday morning, told me how very little, if any, new money is being loaned for housing&mdash;very low amounts. The rental vacancy rate in the ACT at the moment on domestic housing is swinging between four and six per cent. I am told by the experts that that is not very healthy. The commercial building vacancy rate in this town is sitting around 10 per cent and upwards. I might add that we now have a government flogging off buildings on top of that.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4185"> father, Jimmy, was a seaman from Murray Island. His mother, Gada, was from Darnley Island. He married Betty Cook, who is now deceased, on 23 August 1948. They had seven children: Maria, Elsie, Ray, Rebecca, Cyril, Bakoi and Thomas. He had 21 grandchildren and eight great&hyphen;grandchildren.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Etti grew up on Darnley Island and was one of the first soldiers to join up in 1941 when the first company, A Company, was formed of the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion. Soon after, almost every able-bodied man on Erub joined the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion. Etti was trained in combat and was involved in the building of a dam on Horn Island. It was during this time that he began to emerge as an activist for his people, strongly opposing injustices inflicted on them. He served in the army until 1946.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He returned to Darnley Island and served as a community police officer before a stint as a carpenter working for the Department of Native Affairs where he was involved in the building of the Bamaga settlement. In 1948 he and his brother, Daniel, purchased a crayfishing lugger, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rebecca</EMPHASIS>, which they operated until 1957.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1967 he travelled to Canberra with fellow Torres Strait Islanders Elia Ware and Thomas Lowah to march with the Aboriginal people calling on the federal government to hold a referendum enabling indigenous people to have equal rights with other Australians. To raise the money to make this trip to Canberra, Etti launched an appeal on the local radio station. He spent each day in the lead-up to his trip asking passers-by to donate money into his bowler hat. This way of raising money he continued right until his death, as he travelled south to meet ministers lobbying them to improve conditions for his people. In fact, many of his trips were paid for with his pension and his own fundraising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the war, he became the founding member of the Torres Strait Ex-Servicemen, holding the position of president from its inception until his recent death. As president of this organisation, he lobbied strongly on behalf of the valiant members of the 1st Torres Strait Light Infantry. Etti was an extremely active member of the communi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ty, holding positions in many organisations in the Torres Strait. He was the founding member of the Torres Strait Housing Co-op, founding member of the Pasa Gabe Housing and Community Support Group in Cairns, a community councillor for Tamwoy and was on the organising committee of the Torres Strait Cultural Festival from 1989. He was awarded the OAM in recognition of his community achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Etti's lobbying also resulted in the introduction of a student allowance and sole parent allowance for indigenous people. His lack of education did not deter him from taking on any person of authority, including Australia's Prime Minister. He, in fact, invited the Prime Minister of the day to visit Thursday Island, and he was very proud of that. He accompanied the Prime Minister on the visit to the Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Etti had been invited to speak at the reconciliation convention currently taking place at the World Congress Centre in Melbourne. Sadly, he passed away suffering from cancer at the Townsville Base Hospital in the early hours of Tuesday morning, 20 May. He is to be buried on Thursday Island in his beloved Torres Strait this Friday, 30 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I am most privileged to have been asked by his family to speak at his wake. I wear this colourful tie tonight in honour of my wonderful friend Etti Pau, depicting the three most important resources for the Torres Strait Island people: the dugong, the turtle and the magnificent reef. Finally, I would like to say Kaima Esso to Etti for all your hard work, commitment and dedication to your beautiful Torres Strait and your nation of Australia. Yawo to a dear friend. You will never be forgotten.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4185"><TITLE>Newcastle</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reasoned arguments in favour of lifting the ban on parallel imports of CDs have all been heard. Now it is the turn of the CD import monopolists&mdash;and all they can do is throw everything against the wall and hope and pray that something resonates. I cannot blame the big six music companies for defending so stoutly their golden acre, but it is high time we redrew the boundaries and distributed the benefits to the Australian consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latest attempt to preserve the status quo comes by way of a scare campaign&mdash;a three-pronged argument warning that the USA will no longer trade with us, that pirates will plunder us and our music market, and that Australian artists and our Australian cultural 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4187"> music identity will wither and die. These assertions are powerful, but blatantly false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is true that the United States has sought an international agreement on import monopolies for some time, its mission has failed. Such an agreement is not part of the Berne, GATT or WTO conventions and import policies are clearly a matter for each individual nation. The US knows it is fighting a losing battle trying to impose trade restrictions on a world intent on removing all of the barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lifting of the ban on the parallel import of CDs does not mean that the market will be flooded with pirated music. Piracy will remain illegal; it will not be permissible to manufacture or import unauthorised compact discs. The demand for pirated product will be reduced as the price for the real thing comes down. The record stores are watched closely by the music companies and would likely detect very early any increases in piracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Artists are, to use the jargon, discovered and signed to recording contracts because they are seen as potential money-spinners. While sceptics have said that talent has little to do with this process, I maintain that the country of origin has even less. There will always be an Australian industry. Exposure in local entertainment outlets will guarantee that some performers are snapped up&mdash;perhaps first by the smaller independent labels and then later by the bigger concerns. That happens now and will continue to happen, no matter the nation's policy on parallel imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ban on parallel imports does not protect the local industry or its jobs. There is no restriction on the quantity of compact discs for import. Rather, the restriction is confined to who may import them. As a consequence, the limited competition guarantees that Australian retail prices are far higher than they should be. The Australian consumers are being touched and the marketing gimmicks used by the music companies do not disguise that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of Australians buying CDs direct from the US via the Internet does not hurt the monopolists at all. Their parent companies end up with the money anyway. The local CD stores, however&mdash;those employ 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing people&mdash;are the ones who miss the boat. The reality of borderless trade is never better illustrated than as it is with the quick purchase and delivery of small consumer products on the Net&mdash;door&hyphen;to&hyphen;door delivery from anywhere in the world and cheaper than going to the local mall and, in some instances, quicker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, it is time to change the law, time to lift the ban on parallel importing of CDs and time to end the dominance of the gang of six, who sell their wares at a low price in the United States but take advantage of arcane laws here to grab excessive profits from Australian consumers. On latest average retail figures, CDs in Australia are still over 40 per cent more expensive than in the USA. This makes little of the recently touted line that Australia has the best specials in the CD buying world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be extremely disheartening to CD buyers if the import monopoly is allowed to continue. By dismantling the cartel and allowing parallel imports, we would boost competition, lower prices and surely provide a great boost to sales. There would, indeed, be few unhappy with that situation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4187"><TITLE>Hospitals: Funding Cuts</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V5">Mr Williams</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. Federal Agent Jacobsen is an experienced member of the Australian Federal Police who has been working in Western Australia since 1980 on investigations into serious crime and major fraud, including Medicare fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I am advised that Federal Agent Jacobsen did not make any such approach to Miss Susan Stewart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes. During Dr Jemielita's trial the prosecution played a tape recording of the police interview of Dr Jemielita. The prosecution tendered this tape recording as exhibit 62. The prosecution also provided the trial Judge and the jury with a transcript of the tape recording as an aid to which they could refer whilst the tape recording 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was played during the trial. The prosecution tendered this transcript as exhibit 63. The judge also permitted the jury to have access to the tape and transcript during its final deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Yes. The prosecution tendered the tapes of the record of interview as exhibit 62 as the primary evidence of the interview. The prosecution tendered the transcript of the recording as exhibit 63 to assist the judge and jury in understanding the tape recording.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) In this trial both the tapes and the transcript of the tapes were tendered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Yes, the prosecution made the transcript available to Dr Jemielita's defence by 19 October 1992, some 35 days before the trial commenced on 23 November 1992. The DPP also made the tape recording available to Dr Jemielita's defence by 5 November 1992, some 18 days before the trial commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was therefore open to Dr Jemielita to refute the transcript from, at the latest, 5 November 1992. At no time before the trial did Dr Jemielita attempt to refute the transcript.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tape recording of the interview with Dr Jemielita was played during the trial. Throughout the trial and particularly when the tape recording was played to the court, Dr Jemielita and his counsel had every opportunity to refute any part of the transcript. At no time during the trial did Dr Jemielita or his counsel challenge the transcript's veracity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 8 January 1993 Dr Jemielita appealed to the Western Australian Full Court of Criminal Appeal against his conviction. The appeal was heard on 6 May 1993. At no time from 5 November 1992 up to or during the appeal did Dr Jemielita challenge the veracity of the transcript of the record of interview.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The DPP is unable to say. The transcript was in the custody of the District Court from the trial which began in November 1992 until 12 June 1996 when the transcript was returned to Federal Agent Jacobsen, along with other exhibits in the trial. The DPP is not aware of any basis for the allegation  that pages were removed and the transcript was falsified during the three and a half years it was in the custody of the District Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Neither the AFP nor Federal Agent Jacobsen have any knowledge of this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) A decision on whether the case should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal will be made once all the reports requested by the Attorney-General's Department have been received and the Departmental submission has been provided to me for consideration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am aware of the 1996 draft plan of management for the Kakadu National Park that has been prepared jointly by the Kakadu Board of Management and Parks Australia and was released for public comment late last year. The plan has attracted considerable interest, and consistent with the normal process followed for such planning, the Kakadu Board and Parks Australia are currently reviewing the plan in the light of the 97 submissions received. To help with this process, the Board has met with fishing and conservation interests to discuss their comments on the plan, and the Board's Tourism Consultative Committee and Research Advisory Committee have provided specialist input to the Board on tourism and research comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Under the procedure established by the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, the plan is prepared jointly by the Kakadu Board and Parks Australia. I would expect that the plan as revised after consideration of public comments will be submitted for my consideration by mid year. The full set of public comments and the analysis of the comments will also be submitted to me at this time. Parks Australia has kept my office informed of progress with public comments on the draft plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) I have not commented on the draft plan in any formal sense. I have discussed aspects of the plan with the Kakadu Board, and with a number of parties who have made representations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated in (2), the preparation of the plan is the responsibility of the Kakadu Board and Parks Australia. Once they have submitted the revised plan, the full set of public comments on the draft plan, and the analysis of how the Board and Parks Australia have considered the comments in revising the plan, I will be in a position to consider the plan formally. What is in the public domain at present is simply a draft for public comment.</PARA>
