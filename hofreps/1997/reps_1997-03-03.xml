<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the committee's advisory report on the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1996, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HK5">Mr ANDREWS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to present to the House the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1996. I also table the minutes and evidence of the inquiry. The committee was asked by the House to consider the bill and to prepare an advisory report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The object of the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill is to enable Australians imprisoned overseas and foreign nationals imprisoned in Australia to be returned to their home countries to complete their sentences. The bill is the first formal step in establishing a transfer scheme for Australia. Other steps include the states and territories passing complementary legislation and Australia entering into treaties with other countries providing for the processes and conditions which will govern the transfers between our countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As the bill is the product of the combined efforts of the federal, state and territory governments, the committee sought evidence from the various government authorities involved in the development of the legislation. The committee also took evidence when it visited the Parklea Correctional Centre at Blacktown, New South Wales. At Parklea, the committee held discussions with the governor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and took formal evidence from a prisoner who is a foreign national and who would, if Australia had an international transfer of prisoners scheme, be interested in transferring to another country to serve the remainder of his sentence. That prisoner also told us in conversation of other prisoners in similar circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The committee also received written evidence from an Australian who is imprisoned in an overseas gaol and who wishes to transfer to Australia to serve the remainder of his sentence. Other evidence was received from the families of prisoners serving prison sentences overseas, the Human Rights Commissioner, the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, the Public Defenders Office and the International Commission of Jurists and various academics. Also, the committee received statements from other organisations saying that they did not wish to make a written submission or give oral evidence because they were satisfied with the contents of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Much evidence supported having the international transfer of prisoners scheme in place so that Australians overseas, and foreign nationals in Australia, can enjoy the benefits of transfer as soon as possible. Not surprisingly perhaps, the prisoners who provided evidence to the inquiry were strongly in favour of transferring as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee noted that the prisoners themselves were completely accepting of the fact that they had broken a country's laws and deserved to be the subject of punishment. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The distinction the prisoners made, however, was that the punishment was more severe because of the tyranny of distance from their families and because of language, religious and cultural differences. The prisoners also felt that the weight of their punishment was all the greater for their families because they were imprisoned in a foreign country. The prisoners' claims for transfer were founded on their wishes to be close to their families as soon as possible, and thereby to ease the hardships the families faced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The families of Australians in gaol overseas provided the most compelling evidence in favour of the transfer scheme commencing as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1668"> soon as possible. The stories of the hardships endured by members of the families of the several prisoners the committee received evidence about were moving. The committee believes that no-one would view such evidence and not support the humanitarian purpose of the bill or not wish to offer encouragement for the transfer scheme to commence as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This legislation has its origins in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, or SCAG. In the standing committee, ministers from all the states and mainland territories together with the federal ministers have spent many hours developing this transfer regime for transfers involving Australia. No doubt this was one of the reasons why there is such a high degree of satisfaction with the bill and the transfer scheme that the bill intends to introduce. Experience has shown that it is never an easy task to achieve agreement when so many jurisdictions are involved as it requires a true spirit of compromise. The committee commends the work of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in developing the transfer scheme and the subsequent legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The committee is aware nonetheless that, despite the high level of success of this joint project, some jurisdictions still have reservations about the scheme. In some cases these reservations may be strong enough to prevent the scheme from becoming a truly national one. The scheme will be compromised if even one state or territory does not pass the complementary legislation necessary to enable the scheme to work in Australia. Such an outcome would be most unfortunate, as it would mean that Australians would not have equal access to the transfer regime, and the hardship for families of those prisoners would be prolonged unnecessarily.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed some prisoners may be prevented from ever returning to Australia to complete their sentences because of the requirement for community ties in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee believes that all Australians should have equal access to the international transfer of prisoners scheme as soon as possible. The committee urges all states and territories therefore to take part in the scheme 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and to pass complementary legislation as a matter of priority. A critical feature of the general transfer scheme is that it requires a three-way consent: firstly, of the prisoner concerned; secondly, of the transfer country; and, thirdly, of Australia&mdash;including any involved state or territory government. Accordingly, there are four consents required for an Australian prisoner: from the prisoner, the transfer country, the Commonwealth and the relevant state or territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee agrees with the argument that the consent of the prisoner should be an informed consent. Prisoners should not be required to make decisions about transferring without at least the opportunity of obtaining information about the prison conditions in the country they wish to transfer to. The committee therefore recommended that regulations provide that prisoners be given information about either prison conditions in the country they wish to transfer to or relevant organisations that provide such information prior to making the decision about being transferred to that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On a further matter, as this bill introduces an important new scheme, the committee has also recommended that the operation of the legislation be reviewed by the Attorney-General's Department annually and that a report of that review be tabled in the parliament. The recommendations on the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1996 are not contentious and I doubt that accepting them would result in any undue delay of the passage of the bill. I do believe, however, that they will enhance the operation of Australia's international transfer of prisoners scheme. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I rise to support the remarks of the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) in tabling this report. The report was agreed to unanimously by members of the committee and, as such, I do not wish to go through extensively the matters which have already been canvassed by the member for Menzies.  </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1669">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is one of those examples in which members of the House of Representatives are able to work together on issues of common concern and arrive at an agreed result. I guess the public picture of us as members of parliament is that we yell and scream at each other across the dispatch box and other places at question time. But the reality is that a lot of useful work is done by members of parliament in examining issues closely of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did have the opportunity not only to hear submissions from prisoners and from people who have been involved in the administration of overseas prisons and have had contacts with Australian prisoners abroad but also to examine the issues which arrive under a scheme for the international transfer of prisoners whereby we in Australia would house prisoners who have been convicted of offences overseas while other countries would have the option to house prisoners who have been convicted of offences here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As I indicated, it is a consensus report and enjoys the support of all members on that standing committee. One issue which did occupy us for some time is: what happens if some manifest injustice is shown to have occurred once a prisoner is serving the remainder of their sentence in Australia? If a prisoner has either exhausted or waived all their appeal rights how will the requirement apply in those circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the argument that if a manifest injustice is shown to have arisen that a person should not be required to waive all their appeal rights in order to come to Australia. The converse argument which was put very strongly by the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who has some experience as the previous Minister for Justice in these areas, was that to allow prisoners to come here in circumstances where they have not waived all their appeal rights would lead to prisoners incessantly endeavouring to relitigate issues once they have arrived in Australia. That would put stress not only on the administration of justice in this country but also on the credibility of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think most people would understand that if Australia were seen to be endeavouring to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> second&hyphen;guess the decisions and the convictions that had been arrived at in courts overseas once prisoners arrived here then the system would quickly break down. The committee resolved therefore that this issue should be reviewed in a year's time. We are supporting the existing provisions of the bill whereby prisoners can only come to Australia once they have either exhausted or waived all their appeal rights. Nevertheless, this is an issue which the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) might wish to look at in a year's time, if there is a review of this legislation in a year's time as the committee recommends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The other point that ought to be made is that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs enjoys very strong support from its secretariat&mdash;Claressa Surtees and other members of the secretariat&mdash;who have assisted us in the preparation of this report. On behalf of the chairman, myself and other members of the committee, I would extend our appreciation of the work that they have done.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6V5">Mr EOIN CAMERON</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Stirling)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.44 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the South Pacific Conference in Saipan and bilateral visits to Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. At the outset, I would like to thank my colleague the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), who accompanied me on the delegation and made an invaluable contribution throughout, particularly through his knowledge of fishery and forestry matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with some regret that I note we did not have a representative from the opposition. This was something which was commented on by parliamentarians and officials in a number of the countries we visited. We did originally have a member of the opposition set up to come along on this particular delegation but 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1670"> for some reason or other they had to drop out and we could not find a replacement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that it could be difficult for some people to get away for the period of time involved, because it was a reasonably lengthy delegation, going through October into November 1996. It was about three weeks in total. When you consider the number of countries we visited and the amount of work that was involved in those countries, it was a particularly busy visit. I would urge my colleagues that if, perhaps, visits to the South Pacific are not as attractive as visits to Europe and the United States they are certainly worthwhile. This is the second time that I have been fortunate enough to visit the South Pacific conference. The first visit was to Vanuatu a couple of years ago. I would thoroughly recommend to my colleagues the opportunity to attend the next one. It will be considerably easier because it will be here in Canberra, I suspect in October this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank Dr Tony Murney, the secretary of the delegation, who was tireless in his efforts and did an absolutely outstanding job of keeping the show on the road and making sure all of our meetings and discussions were well documented. He did that particularly well. The Parliamentary Relations Office did their usual professional job of ensuring we were well briefed on the political and social issues we were likely to face in the various countries we would visit. One area, however, that I would like to draw to the attention of the Parliamentary Relations Office is the travelling arrangements&mdash;and this is not a criticism; it is something I have discussed with them privately. Towards the end of the delegation's visit it became clear that alternative travel arrangements would be far more convenient and cost effective. There appears to be a certain inflexibility once an itinerary has been set. It was explained to me that the rules have to be fairly rigid to prevent itineraries being altered willy&hyphen;nilly once a delegation is overseas. However, in the case of our particular delegation, because of the delays caused by a number of typhoons in the region we were visiting, the delegation could have returned to Australia at the completion of our official duties both earlier and more cheaply 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> if we had been able to apply some flexibility. This is just something I would like to note for future delegations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I intend to speak in fairly general terms with a brief overview of the delegation while my colleague, the member for Paterson, will give some specific detail. I had made a bilateral visit to Papua New Guinea in 1994 following the South Pacific conference in Vanuatu. I was saddened to see that, in Port Moresby at least, the law and order problem did not seem to have improved. At all times we were surrounded by extremely heavy security&mdash;something we were very grateful to the Papua New Guinea government for, with Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan providing two of his personal guards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once away from the city, the security problem was not so severe and we were able to see Australian aid in action, which was the primary purpose of our visit there. There were a number of very impressive projects and, I should add, some good work was being done by the European Union, particularly in the area of the walkabout sawmills. That is something the member for Paterson had a particular interest in. I was also pleased to see that because, in the time that we were in Papua New Guinea, we flew over areas that included some islands that had been completely denuded. This was just before the monsoonal rains&mdash;and you knew what was going to happen once the rain started: all of the topsoil would be washed into the sea and the land would be useless for evermore. Most of this vandalism was done by overseas companies. So we were particularly pleased about the walkabout mills, which allowed the local people to concentrate more on looking after their own resources in their own area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The notion of tied aid, although unpopular in some circles, certainly appears to have been warmly welcomed by the people in the provinces. Over a period of time, Australia has moved away from budgetary aid to the so&hyphen;called tied aid; that is, aid for specific projects. This way one can see, in very clear terms, exactly what the Australian taxpayer is getting for the aid dollar. In all the places we visited what struck me in particular was the fact that the smaller aid projects appear to be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1671"> the ones that are more appreciated. Because they are of a modest nature, the local communities can become involved, with a greater sense of ownership resulting. I highly commend AusAID for the work they are doing in the Pacific region, especially on the very small projects. We met some very fine people who are working with AusAID in a number of the countries we visited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Outside Port Moresby is the Bomana prison, which is a particularly sad place: overcrowded and in a very poor state. We noted that, in the past, the Papua New Guinea prison system was very self&hyphen;sufficient. They had vegetable gardens, a dairy and poultry sheds. There is evidence of where these were but everything has, sadly, gone into disrepair. The prison was particularly depressing and run down. One of the officials suggested that if they could get some paint the prisoners could paint the mess area&mdash;which was particularly depressing&mdash;themselves and that if they did the work themselves they might be more inclined to look after it. I am happy to report that, upon our return to Australia, I contacted Mr Lou Luca and Mr Ron Semeones of Cameleon Paints, a specialist paint company in my electorate of Stirling. Cameleon Paints immediately threw themselves into the project and have provided 200 kilograms of a special paint they have devised to cope with tropical conditions. As an act of goodwill, Cameleon Paints have donated this paint and it will shortly be heading to Papua New Guinea with Qantas air freight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentarians and officials we met in Papua New Guinea were most gracious in their welcome. It was great to catch up with Sir Rabbie Namaliu, the Speaker of the House and former Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. Our thanks too to His Excellency Mr David Irvine, our High Commissioner, and to Meikie Flach, the Second Secretary, who accompanied the delegation throughout our visit to Papua New Guinea. He was of invaluable assistance, as were the PNG Sergeant&hyphen;at&hyphen;Arms, Legu Vagi, and parliamentary officer Deborah Kanu. Because of the logistical problems of travelling in the Pacific we were thankful to our own Prime Minister, John 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Howard, who assisted our travel arrangements to the Solomon Islands and Nauru.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Solomons we saw Australian aid at work. I know I am speaking for Bob Baldwin as well when I say how moved we were to have the privilege to lay a wreath at sea over the site of the sinking of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra</EMPHASIS>, where 84 Australians lost their lives during the Battle of Guadalcanal. Bob will go into more detail about our Solomons visit but I would particularly like to thank the Speaker, the honourable Paul Tovua OBE, and the Clerk, Mr James Saliga OBE. James is one of the great characters of the Pacific. I would also like to thank the Australian High Commissioner, Rob Flynn, and his team who were magnificent in the way they prepared for our visit and meticulous in all the briefings and debriefings they provided for us. On a personal note, I would like to thank James McCormack from the Australian High Commission. Nothing was too much trouble for James and he did not lose his sense of humour once&mdash;even when he had to wash Bob Baldwin's shirts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the Solomons it was on to the South Pacific conference in Saipan. I again thank Dr Tony Murney, the delegation secretary, for the very thorough coverage he has given to the details of the conference in chapter 4 of the report that I have just presented. During our visit to Saipan and Guam it was particularly pleasing to meet with a group of Australian expatriate business men and women. I know it is included in the report but I would like to repeat our thanks to Gary and Leonie Curran and Mr and Mrs Graham Poon for their hospitality. Our itinerary in Guam, Saipan and the Federated States of Micronesia was organised by His Excellency Mr Perry Head, the Australian ambassador to the region. Perry is one of the best things Australia could have done in the Pacific region. With his enthusiastic approach on the diplomatic and trade fronts, he and his team are making sure that Australia's interests are being well served.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The embassy is on Pohnpei, one of the four states of the Federated States of Micronesia, the others being Chuuk, Yap and Kosrae. We were welcomed to the FSM by the Speaker of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1672"> Congress, the Hon. Jack Fritz, and I can honestly say I do not think I have ever received a warmer welcome in my life, both at a brief touchdown on Chuuk and then at Pohnpei. We were fortunate to meet with many parliamentarians and officials in the FSM, including the Governor, the Hon. Del Pangelinan. We were able to see again the effectiveness of Australian small aid projects, including a clinic in a very impoverished village in Kolonia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were most impressed with the Pohnpei Agriculture and Trade School, or PATS, as it is known. The school was set up in the early 1960s by the Jesuit order. It is the only vocational high school in Micronesia. Its director, Father Joe Bilotti, explained that the school's emphasis on the basic skills of outboard motor maintenance, diesel mechanics, agriculture and carpentry is a complete departure from the more usual academic pursuits of the Jesuits, but, as he pointed out, the college has proved most useful and effective. I was delighted to see former students of the college now employed as lecturers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I would like to say to the Australian Embassy and Ambassador Perry Head that they could not have done more to make our visit more informative and enjoyable. A special mention to Fiona Bricknell, who, I know, did lose her sense of humour but did not show it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the report of the delegation to the South Pacific conference in Saipan and bilateral visits to Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. Clearly, I would like to echo the thoughts of my colleague, the outstanding leader of the delegation, Mr Eoin Cameron, the member for Stirling. I would also like to praise our travelling companion Dr Tony Murney, who, as Eoin said, worked extremely hard to make sure that all of the hiccups one encounters when travelling through areas in the South Pacific were met with a minimum amount of trouble and it is a credit to the man to have resolved them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to go through individually the different countries that we travelled to on our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trip between 22 October and 8 November. After departing Cairns, we went to Papua New Guinea, a country that we now hear is so torn by strife with the introduction of mercenaries to seek a resolution to the Bougainville crisis. Whilst that issue was not a key part of our visit and we did not visit Bougainville, it did rest in our minds with the assassination of Mr Miriung, the representative of the people in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hospitality extended to us by the Speaker, Sir Rabbie Namaliu and, in particular, the sergeant who travelled with us through the areas of Papua New Guinea, and Mr Legu Vagi, a former member of parliament, pointed out some peculiarities. It was a touch of going back in time as, over 20 years ago, I resided in Papua New Guinea, in Port Moresby. So it was a revisiting of areas that were particularly important to me. One thing I did notice immediately upon touching down in Port Moresby was something that concerned me 20 years ago, that is, that areas around Port Moresby do not have the benefit of electric ovens and stoves. Indeed, the way that they cook a lot of the basic sustenance food is by wood fire stoves. The major thing&mdash;and I commented to my colleague Eoin Cameron at the time&mdash;was the lack of forestation around Port Moresby, in particular for an area that does rely so heavily on timber for basic life provision. One would have thought that they perhaps could have concentrated some of their efforts in replanting trees around the Moresby area to provide an ongoing resource of timber directly as needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also visited the Bomana war cemetery. That was a very eye&hyphen;opening experience and something that I will remember for a long time. Due credit must go to Mr Carter, the caretaker of the cemetery. I have to say the manicured lawns, their condition and the state of the graves were a definite credit to him. Having looked at the names and, in particular, the ages of the fallen soldiers whose graves lie there and having seen the graves of some of the unnamed soldiers who lie there, one can bring back a message to the people of Australia that they should be very proud of the people who gave their lives in New 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1673"> Guinea and on the Kokoda Trail in defending our freedoms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have already heard my colleague mention my particular interest in fishing and forestry. I particularly looked at that when we went to discuss areas of fishing, illegal fishing vessels and, in particular, the actions to be taken by the government. One thing that I will report back to this parliament is that there seems to be a concentrated effort through the whole of the South Pacific to apprehend illegal fishing vessels; this effort has met with different rates of success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We visited Rabaul to see the devastation caused by the volcano, which was still erupting as we flew into Rabaul Harbour. There were remnants of the old airport with the planes still down. The runway was some 12 feet or four metres under ash and the town had to be relocated 30 miles to the south. Seventy per cent of Rabaul was devastated by the volcanic eruption, but amazingly, only five people died in that whole disaster. To the credit of the organisers and administrators of that area, they have been able to relocate with minimum interruption. The process of picking up a whole town and relocating it 30 miles away makes you think of the spirit and perhaps, as it was termed to me when I lived there, the attitude of the land of the Dehore, that is, if it does not happen today, it will happen tomorrow and, if not tomorrow, then possibly next week or the week after. They have resettled very well and, I must say, under very good direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trip also took in the Solomon Islands. I must commend the staff at the Australian High Commission in the Solomon Islands and, in particular, His Excellency, Mr Rob Flynn. I have not seen networking such as what this man has been able to produce in the Solomon Islands. Our thanks go to the Speaker, Mr Paul Tovua, and to Mr James Saliga, the clerk of the national parliament, for their hospitality. They were to be here last week but with an interruption to the flights they were not able to make it. I do look forward to meeting them when they come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my colleague said, on 27 October another solemn experience was visiting the war grave of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra</EMPHASIS>, which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sank on 9 August, 1942 in the Battle of Guadalcanal, with the loss of 84 Australian lives. The war history through the Solomons is something that is to be experienced and, when you visit areas where Australians have laid down their lives for peace, it makes the throat choke. I do not think, particularly with the coming of Anzac Day, that any of us should forget the sacrifices that people have made for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With Assistant Commissioner Mick Wheatley, we had the opportunity to inspect the patrol boat&mdash;there are two, but one was back in Townsville having an annual refit&mdash;and discuss the strategic planning, the way that they go through analysing on a needs and areas basis the use of the patrol boat, in particular for the deterrence and apprehension of illegal fishing. This led to one of my main interests which, as I have said, is fishing, and a visit to the Forum Fisheries Agency, where we met with Ian Cartwright, an Australian who is Deputy Director of Forum Fisheries in Honiara.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a collective of all the countries throughout the South Pacific which subscribe to the fishery industry on better management, particularly in relation to collection, analysis, evaluation and dissemination of statistical and biological data in relation to fisheries resources, provision of advice on fisheries management procedures, collection and dissemination of relevant information on prices, shipping and processing so that ongoing value adding can occur, and provision of technical experience in the development of fisheries policies. As an individual, I am very concerned about fishery policy as it affects the whole South Pacific. It would seem that, at points, Australia is one of the end recipients of the migratory fish that come down from the equator through the South Pacific. If there is too heavy fishing or the wrong type of fishing or wrong processes that occur at the very top end, Australia indeed is the loser at the very bottom end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that gave me the greatest joy on the whole trip was when we met with John Gildea on the aid project in the Solomons. Australia has invested some $9 million in water supply, sanitation and teach 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1674"> ing projects. We took a trip down to the north-west of Guadalcanal and had a look at a project where they have built a water tank at the very top of a mountain. The water is collected from a spring and put into the tank, and then piped down the hill and taken out of taps and shower facilities at the different villages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, there was the provision of very basic sanitation through septic toilets. What happened previously was that all of the effluent would go into the river. The people at the very top of the river up the mountain were getting clean water but, by the time it got down to the beach, the people down there had less than pure areas to live in and go into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As time is escaping me, I will quickly pass on to the subject of the Federated States of Micronesia, where His Excellency Perry Head&mdash;again, an outstanding networker through the South Pacific&mdash;has responsibilities for Guam, Federated States of Micronesia. He networks, to the benefit of Australia, looking for trade opportunities through there. My thanks must also go to Jack Fritz, the Speaker, for the hospitality provided there.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would just like to wrap up by saying that I can only echo everything that the member for Paterson, my friend Bob Baldwin, has said. I urge all Australian politicians and the Australian government to perhaps have a greater focus on the Pacific region. These countries are our closest neighbours and the people do consider Australia as their big brother.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we very often become focused on the events of our largest Pacific neighbour Papua New Guinea, and neglect some of the smaller countries. It is only when you visit these smaller countries that you realise how importantly they regard Australia and how much they rely on us as friends and for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> guidance in some areas and of course on the small amount of aid that we do give to some of the countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the Federated States of Micronesia, I would challenge probably most members of this parliament to point out where they are, to tell us the name of the capital or anything else, because it is an area we know little of. That is why I am so pleased with what the ambassador for Australia, Mr Perry Head, is doing in the Federated States of Micronesia to increase trade, because the United States, which has been the big kahuna in that part of the world for so long, is slowly withdrawing from that area. I would like to see the vacuum filled by a friendly nation like Australia. Fortunately, travelling in the more northern area of the Pacific as we were, and not in a place like Tonga&mdash;where the larger you are the wealthier you are&mdash;people did not consider that Bob Baldwin and I were just fat, wealthy Australians; I think they suspected that we both needed to go on a diet. They were all perfectly correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude by saying that this is the second delegation that I have been fortunate enough to go on to represent the parliament of the people of Australia. After the first one, I thought it is ridiculous how much you try to fit in in such a short period of time and, when I have spoken to anyone who has ever gone on a delegation overseas, it is the same old problem. This particular time, I harped and whinged and moaned and said that, rather than insult the people by having too little time and it looks like you are displaying a lack of interest in a particular project by having to run from one thing to another and then forgetting where you are and what time of day it is, perhaps we should try to cut the program down a bit. Still we ran into those problems and had to split resources. Bob had to go and represent us at one place and I had to go to another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just make the plea that, in future, we try to make the delegations workable because, although this was a highly successful one, I think it could have been even more so if we had had a little more time&mdash;not in terms of days, because we were away for quite long 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1675"> enough, but in the time allocated for each of our engagements.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Fishing is of major importance in the Federated States of Micronesia, which we also visited. One of the facilities there, the Pohnpei Fisheries Corporation, is an example of assistance to the people. Employing 70 people, including only one expatriate, the company is run by James Movick. Apart from the exporting of frozen and fresh tuna, they have gone into value&hyphen;adding by producing tuna in a jerky style&mdash;dried, smoked and with various spices for consumption. My colleague and I tasted those and thought that they had a lot of potential for a unique market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, what I found particularly encouraging during this visit was the amount of networking that our colleagues have produced there. All of our commission staff&mdash;and not just the ambassadors or high commissioners&mdash;should be congratulated for that. The ability to network the community and look for trade opportunities and in particular the administration of aid projects are also encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no greater answer to give to Australians who question overseas aid than to report back the smiles that were wider than the Sydney Harbour Bridge in appreciation of simple things such as clean water, very basic education facilities, the protection of their natural resource, which is fisheries, the ongoing development and maximisation of return through things such as the walkabout sawmills and also just advice on agriculture and forestation. I recommend the report to the House and I look forward to a continuing personal education in the South Pacific.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This motion is prompted by the first&hyphen;hand experience I gained from walking the Kokoda Track over a 10&hyphen;day period recently. I was accompanied by the seconder of the motion, the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), and also Senator Julian McGauran, who is in the gallery today. Our trek leader was the Hon. Charlie Lynn from the New South Wales state Upper House, who did a tremendous job. I acknowledge his experience and his  contribution to many of the ideas in this speech because has now been over the track 19 times. In many ways, he is the Des Renford of the Kokoda Track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We trekked from Kokoda, in the north, 90 to 100 kilometres in a southerly direction over the Owen Stanley Ranges to Owers Corner, just north of Port Moresby. There were 23 people in our party and we had 26 porters, of whom many are grandsons of the fuzzy wuzzy angels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a gruelling ordeal. The jungle and terrain are unrelenting and unforgiving. It throws everything at you and never leaves you alone, right up to the last step. You sweat profusely and you need lots of fluid if you are not going to dehydrate. In the afternoons and evenings you are wringing wet from the downpours of rain but you cannot dry out any clothing; you have to put wet clothing on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1676"> again in the morning. And yet it can be freezing cold at night up in the highlands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extremely difficult trekking at night because many of the slopes are up to 75 or 80 degrees in steepness, and then you go down again on slippery yellow clay, falling over all the time. You have to be careful where you put your feet because you do not want to twist your ankle on the roots that run everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your lungs heave and your muscles ache. Blisters were rife&mdash;I had bandaids on every toe, I think. Your boots are wet from stream crossings and your skin sloshing around in your boots becomes like tissue paper. Foot problems such as fungal infections are rife. You can get infected insect bites, vomiting is not uncommon, and I got severe diarrhoea, which is extremely painful and debilitating. Our soldiers back in 1942 cut the backsides out of their pants in many instances. Damien Parer, who filmed the Kokoda campaign, had a tube running from his rectum into a bottle in his sock so he could continue filming. I know I lost six kilograms in 10 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leeches drop out of the trees and fasten onto your neck. We all suffered with tears and emotion at times, and this is on a track which is in some cases only four inches wide&mdash;the width of a footprint&mdash;and up to four foot wide or more. But move 10 metres off the track and you can get lost. Just to cross this track becomes the ultimate bushwalking feat. We have all seen TV images, I guess, of strapping athletes cracking up, celebrities like Angry Anderson breaking down and trekkers becoming physically and mentally destroyed by the rigour of it all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Kokoda campaign was fought between July and November 1942. Our side started off at the village of Kokoda with undertrained soldiers who were outgunned and had an average age of 18&half; years. But they fought courageously against an enemy who was battle hardened, superior in numbers and better equipped with artillery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Japanese had landed in their thousands at Buna and Gona in the north and were going to sweep south overland to Port Moresby within a period of days. That was done in the context of the Japanese, from late 1941 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and early 1942, sweeping all before them in Malaya, capturing Singapore, attacking Pearl Harbour, and taking the Philippines and Rabaul. Within 100 days they had captured all of South&hyphen;East Asia. It was only the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway and indirectly the campaigns at Milne Bay and Guadalcanal that stopped them sailing into Port Moresby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was 4 p.m. on 23 July when only 30 Australian soldiers, in the first instance, made the first campaign stand at Kokoda. They had rifles, revolvers, one Lewis machine&hyphen;gun and one drum of ammunition. Eventually they were overwhelmed and that started the history of Kokoda. They fell back from position to position, from village to village, from hill to hill, fighting and delaying the Japanese on every inch that they conceded. They had battles at Deniki and Isurava, which was our Alamo, I guess, and where the first VC was won on Australian soil&mdash;because New Guinea was mandated territory&mdash;by Bruce Kingsbury. Other battles were fought at Alola, Eora Creek, Templetons Crossing, Myola, Kagi, Efogi, Manari, Brigade Hill and Iorabaiwa Ridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By doing that even though they were outnumbered six to one on many occasions under atrocious conditions and showing enormous courage, they eventually weakened the Japanese, who had previously been invincible on land. They stretched their lines of supply so long and the Japanese were so starved by having only half a handful of rice and a bit of seaweed to eat&mdash;and in some cases by resorting to cannibalism&mdash;and they were so debilitated that the Australians turned the Japanese round in September when they were only 40 to 60 kilometres from Port Moresby and steadily drove them back the full length of the track and recaptured Kokoda on 2 November.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an epic story; it is a story that is the spirit of Kokoda. Kokoda to World War II is what Gallipoli was to World War I. However, while we lost Gallipoli we still won the war. But if we had lost Kokoda then we would have lost Port Moresby and the Japanese would have had a launching pad into Australia. It was a very significant campaign. We fought it on our own. The heroism displayed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1677"> at Kokoda was no less than at Gallipoli, the odds facing us were no more favourable but the terrain and climate were far more foreign and horrific&mdash;so Kokoda is very special.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, Australian governments of all colours have, in the past, done very little to recognise the importance of the track. To his credit, previous Prime Minister Keating went to Kokoda but unfortunately he was made head of the Orokaevian tribe who carried for the Japanese. He put money into an airport terminal at Kokoda at the wrong end of the strip. Three pillars are all that remain of it now, as depicted in this photograph. I was alarmed and surprised to find that nobody has ever acknowledged the Koiari people&mdash;the fuzzy wuzzy people. Little has been done to commemorate the famous battle sites along the track&mdash;particularly Isurava and Brigade Hill. It appears that there are 72 soldiers buried at Brigade Hill. I believe that should be fully investigated and perhaps made an official war graves site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to get `ownership' of the Kokoda Track before the Japanese move in more than they have. Already the first monuments that have gone up on the track are Japanese ones. It seems that all that has been done&mdash;apart from a little at Kokoda&mdash;has been by an expatriate dentist, Ross Bastian, working out of Port Moresby. Through his own initiative he has  put up three or four plaques on the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not one cent of our foreign aid&mdash;over $6 billion since  Independence in 1975&mdash;has gone to the Koiari people, even when we are giving $320 million this year. To our detriment we have not fully acknowledged what the fuzzy wuzzy angels have done. They carried supplies and ammunition for us. We could not have won the campaign without them. They carried out our diggers when they were wounded. They were never paid for that. Many thousands of them contributed; only 20 or 30 odd remain alive. We met some of them on the trip and it was very emotional. I believe we should strike a carrier service medal for them. It is a simple thing to do. It is basically all they want. We could probably do more and give them a small ex gratia 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> payment. We have to do more for the Koiari people who <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">did so much for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe a health and education foundation should be set up and a scholarship scheme established. We already support 550 scholarships in Papua New Guinea but none for the Koiari people. Scholarships could be given for medicine, education and perhaps sport. Malaria is rife along the track; TB is also prevalent, particularly in the north; and there are respiratory problems. Village museums could be set up at very little cost and the local people could look after them. Military equipment, which is now corroding there, could be restored properly and displayed with photographs, maps and explanations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could set up sister school relationships between  Australia and these people and arrange pen pals and the donation of old sporting equipment. We came across a football field with no footballs, so they had never played a game on the track. It would encourage an appreciation of the history between Australian school children and the Papua New Guinean school children along the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could give advice on setting up simple guest houses in each village. The villagers are very isolated; some have no radio contact with the outside world. We could also set up solar HF radios. By these simple low cost measures we could create enormous goodwill and repay the debt that has been outstanding now for 55 years. The children and grandchildren of the fuzzy wuzzy angels&mdash;they are still angels themselves&mdash;would really appreciate these simple little gestures&mdash;at no cost to the Australian government. I would appreciate bipartisan support for the motion. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) that the motion he has brought before the parliament today on the Kokoda Track campaign enjoys bipartisan support, but with one or two minor qualifications which I will come to in my contribution today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1678">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is important at every opportunity to think of these sorts of issues, particularly on a day such as today when the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) has launched a four&hyphen;year campaign to ensure that education processes are under way in this country which will enable people to have a full understanding of Australians' contributions in theatres of war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague the member for Parkes has indicated that he believes that, through some simple actions&mdash;in education, health and so on&mdash;the contribution of people in Papua New Guinea can be recognised. This is particularly important because their contribution, along with those very valiant members of Australia's defence forces who were along the Kokoda Track during the Second World War&mdash;let us not put too fine a point on it&mdash;saved Australia. As graphically described by my colleague, every inch of the way literally had to be fought for to stem the attack of the Japanese. If they had not been stopped where they were there is no question that Port Moresby would have fallen and that it would have been used as a launching base for further attacks on Australia. Anyone could hazard a guess about the outcome of that. When you put in the time frame and perspective as to when super powers like the United States got involved in the war, it may well have been a little too late for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The battles that occurred along the Kokoda Track in 1942&mdash;as we have indicated, they culminated in the complete defeat of the 15,000&hyphen;strong expeditionary force sent to capture Port Moresby&mdash;are amongst the most important fought in the history of Australia. The member for Parkes is absolutely right to describe the battles on the Kokoda Track as the Second World War version of Gallipoli for Australia. He is absolutely right there. If our troops had not succeeded, the Japanese would have had a very commanding launch pad, as I have said, against the Australian mainland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the name Kokoda certainly evokes emotion in the hearts and minds of most Australians, few are familiar with the names of many critical battle sites along the track such as Isurava, Templetons Crossing, Efogi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or the beachhead battles of Buna or Gona. These names should be seared into the minds of Australians but, sadly, for whatever reason, they are not. Perhaps, as part of the commemorative activities which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs launched today, that may form part of that particular program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At Isurava, for example, the 39th Militia Battalion and the 2nd/14th and 2nd/16th Battalions of the AIF fought a pitched battle against overwhelming odds. They saved the day by slowing the advance of the Japanese who were eventually turned back just outside Port Moresby. I think Australians should learn more about this important battle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private Kingsbury is one such hero of this conflict. Private Kingsbury won the Victoria Cross when he flew into a withering hail of fire to make time for his embattled colleagues. Regrettably, he lost his life while saving his country from invasion. That is a very important point because that is what the Pacific&hyphen;PNG campaigns were all about. Australia was under threat. There was no ambiguity. We were not involved in a far away campaign; it was on our doorstep. That is what made these battles so real.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The efforts of Australian soldiers along the Kokoda track were beyond belief. There were two enemies: the Japanese and the track itself. It was interesting to note the comments of my colleague the member for Parkes when he related his own recent personal experiences. I am sure the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) had similar experiences as she too was a member of the party that made that visit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I too have been to the track, back in 1968, from memory. I was chosen to be a member of an Australian university rugby union side to go to Papua New Guinea. We lost, but we had the opportunity to visit the track. I concur with everything that my colleague has mentioned about the nature of the track. You did not have to venture too far along it to experience the sorts of hardships that people clearly, particularly in a war setting, would have experienced. The soldiers of the time had to battle extreme exhaustion, disease, hunger and a lack of supplies and, at the end of the day, had to fight a significantly larger, better 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1679"> equipped and better disciplined army which was fresh from a string of victories. The Australians defeated their foe in Papua, but at a terrible cost. War cemeteries at Bomana, Lae and other sites contain the graves of thousands of Australians, many as young as 17 or 18, who died to save Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also had the very great pleasure, as was mentioned by my colleagues in the debate immediately preceding this one, of visiting a number of those war cemeteries when I visited PNG when I was Speaker of this parliament. I, too, reflected upon the ages of the Australian soldiers who laid down their lives in defence of our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be remembered that it was overwhelmingly Australian combat troops who achieved this. American troops did not arrive on the scene in Papua New Guinea until the battle of Buna in late 1942&hyphen;early 1943, and even then there were more Australian troops involved in the theatre of operations. It is often easy to overlook that very point. This is not to say that Americans were not critical in the eventual defeat of the Japanese, particularly in respect of the Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway, but we should not lose sight of the fact that it was the Australians who inflicted the first defeat on the Japanese army.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Kokoda campaign was critically aided by the Koiari people in Papua who became known, very affectionately, as fuzzy wuzzy angels. Their compassion and devotion to duty is well remembered by Australian troops. Many more Australians would have died from their wounds if not for the stretcher&hyphen;bearing fuzzy wuzzy angels. One only has to think back to some of the more memorable and moving movie footage that came out of the Second World War, emanating from the Kokoda track, to see these likeable people doing what came naturally to them&mdash;that is, helping Australians who were fighting to save not only Australia but also their own country. I think that is a very important point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995 a pilgrimage of 117 World War II veterans returned to Papua New Guinea to commemorate the battles fought there and the comrades that did not return. Con Sciacca, our distinguished former minister for veterans' affairs, presented the Koiari people with a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> certificate of appreciation on behalf of the Australian government at a ceremony just outside Port Moresby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the point that this motion is attempting to make: that is, efforts such as that and recognition in the form of a certificate of appreciation go part of the way towards saying thankyou from a very grateful nation. But I also take cognisance of the suggestion of the member for Parkes that maybe we could do something else. He suggested we should perhaps strike a medal. Perhaps an ex gratia payment might be made or, more importantly from my perspective, perhaps a real contribution could be made as part of our tied aid program to these people&mdash;recognition, perhaps, through sanitation programs; much better education programs, or the provision of radios, as has been suggested, which is much more tangible when it comes to improving their lifestyle than the giving of a gong. That is the only note of disquiet I express today when supporting the motion that has come before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allied to that, of course, is the fact that since 1975 Papua New Guinea has been a sovereign state. If you have had anything to do with our Pacific Island neighbours&mdash;and my colleagues immediately before this debate were talking about the South Pacific conference&mdash;you will know that many of these people would not like to feel that Australia was in some way perhaps being overly generous or big brotherly. As I have suggested, the deeds of the fuzzy wuzzy angels should live on in our collective memory for many years to come, so I think we have to look at tangible ways of doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly the opposition supports any effort to further commemorate significant battle sites along the Kokoda trail and the deeds of the fuzzy wuzzy angels. I think there is a precedent for funding health and education facilities along that track. I understand that one such facility exists already at Kokoda village and that this was an initiative of the former government but with bipartisan support. Anything such as that&mdash;which will improve the lot of these people to whom we owe so much on behalf of so many&mdash;should not be taken lightly. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak in support of the motion moved by the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). I was with him when he trekked along the Kokoda Trail. I would have to say that if I ever had to choose a site for a battle that would be last place I would choose. I have been a student of military history for a number of years. I served 6&half; years in the RAAF and I served for three years in Malaysia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wherever I have gone around the world&mdash;be it Turkey or Malaysia&mdash;I have, as a student of what is important to Australia, sought out Australian war graves and Australian military sites of significance such as Labuan, Sandakan and Gallipoli. They are all terrifically moving sites when you read up and study the history of them and the sacrifices that our Australian soldiers made there. I think the same thing can be achieved very close to home in relation to the Kokoda Trail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private Kingsbury has been mentioned a lot in this debate. He was a VC winner, but out of the whole Kokoda campaign there are a number of other people of significance whose sacrifices were as great as Kingsbury's and who were awarded DCMs and Military Medals. Charlie McCallum won a DCM. He was the last out of Isurava. He basically single&hyphen;handedly covered the withdrawal of our troops out of Isurava. He was finally killed on 8 December in Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also at Isurava was Lindsay Beer. He was awarded a DCM and MM. He is still alive today and lives in Melbourne. He survived Isurava but he was carried by the fuzzy wuzzies back down the track. Lefty Langdridge and Claude Nye are two very significant people from this battle. They were left in charge of trying to re-establish communications when the Japanese cut communications at Brigade Hill. That was another significant battle. A lot of those who survived Isurava died on Brigade Hill. Some of these men had also fought in the Middle East. So they had survived the European theatre of war to come back to defend Australia and had moved straight into the Pacific campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Claude Nye and Lefty Langdridge led 78 men to re-establish communications. Only six got through. There are 72 men missing in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> action from the battle of Brigade Hill. Siosi Laimu, the Papua New Guinean who basically owns Brigade Hill, stated that he buried 72 Australians on that hill. In my trek across the track I actually saw an Australian army boot with bones still in it. We obviously did not recover all of our dead, and the bodies of Australians are lying along the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something significant we could do is commemorate that grave site and the spirit of those men at Brigade Hill with an Australian government commemorative establishment&mdash;a plaque, a memorial, a museum or collected memorabilia. The track is undoubtedly known world wide. It is probably known internationally&mdash;and throughout America as well&mdash;as the trail. More and more young Australians will probably trek across the track and revisit where their parents went. On the trail with us were several people whose parents were in the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some really incredible stories came out of the campaign. That Gallipoli spirit of Australians was one of the reasons I sought to go on the track. When I did and saw the conditions of the Koiari people along the track, such as their health and their sparse education, I was quite embarrassed for Australia. We have gained a lot of pride and lot of significance from our achievements on the track, but they seem to have been forgotten. The people who were there shoulder to shoulder, the Papuan soldiers who did not have the rifles or the equipment to fight, at least kept us tended and fed and back up the front. These people are frequently days away from help. I treated one fellow for a particularly savage wound to his foot. He was two days walk from any further medical help. The meagre medical kit I took with me for personal use was exhausted in 10 days. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to add my thoughts in the debate on the motion moved by the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and to thank those honourable members who have contributed to this debate so far. As most honourable members would know, the whole topic of honouring our war dead has a special place in my heart, having had a father who was one of the immortal Anzacs and having been able to walk in his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1681"> footsteps on the Gallipoli Peninsula and in France. I have also been privileged during my time in this place to have been able to visit many of the sites where Australian servicemen and women fought to preserve the ideals espoused by this great nation of ours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having been born in 1941, I remember the fathers of many of my school mates reminiscing about their feats in the Western Desert and the Pacific Basin and their stories of the various battlefields strewn around this region to our near north. As a young boy I vividly remember reading the many books that were written on the horrors and experiences of our men and women as they attempted to stem the tied of the Japanese invasion. Who can ever forgot the photos taken in those battles. The one that always sticks in my mind is the one of the blind soldier being led across the creek. That is part of our cultural history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also had the honour of being able to spend some time in that part of the Pacific&mdash;namely, PNG&mdash;mentioned in this motion. To be able to visit the many immaculately kept war cemeteries, to read the many inscriptions on the war graves, to see the Kokoda Trail, the battlefields of Lae, Weewak, Buna and Madang and, more importantly, to spend some time in the villages where Australians were prepared to pay the ultimate sacrifice and where the villagers gave their all in aiding our service personnel has been something special for me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to experience standing on this hallowed ground, to experience the humidity, the tropical rain and the impenetrable jungle and to try to place oneself in their position in those times is very hard for me to explain. I think it is vitally important, as the previous speakers have noted, that we as a nation continue to preserve for future generations those places now and forever immortalised in the pages of our history. Having these battle and grave sites set apart forever so that future generations can marvel at the heroism and valour of those who served in these special places, now so integral a part of our history and our culture, cannot be questioned by anyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be able to repay in some small way&mdash;as we have so rightly done in so many small 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> towns in France where our ancestors fought during World War I&mdash;those magnificent Koiari people of Papua New Guinea, the fuzzy wuzzy angels, as they are better known, is right and proper for us as a nation. A medal to commemorate those who fought as Anzacs came long after the event. A medal to commemorate those who stayed behind and contributed so valiantly to our war effort on the home front during the Second World War&mdash;the civilian service medal&mdash;has only recently been distributed. One wonders why we have waited so long as a nation to recognise these special people in our near north who, as I have said before, are now and forever part of our folklore and war history, for time immemorial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the honourable member for Parkes. I think it is time for us to put our money where our mouth is, to go and work co-operatively with the PNG government, to speak to the villagers and say to them, `What can we do for you? You did it all for us 50&hyphen;odd years ago.' It is not going to take a great deal of money. They only want some simple, basic things for their villages. As the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) has said, our young people are more and more discovering our history, the parts of our life that are spoken of in reverence and awe. I think it is up to us to hand the chalice over to them and say, `We have put something in place; you make sure it remains there.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people speak of the fuzzy wuzzy angels and the Kokoda Trail, as the member for Parkes said, it is linked with Gallipoli and the many other battlefields. I wholeheartedly and bipartisanly support his motion. Hopefully, before too many years, the suggestions contained in his motion will be achieved.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to thank the members on both sides of the House for the spirit in which they have entered this debate. I think we have had strong bipartisan support for what is contained in this motion, which will be to the betterment of not only the fuzzy wuzzy angel people but also the Australian people. Many of the contributions made by those on both sides of the House have been very constructive. I am grateful to members for their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1682"> support. It is very encouraging indeed to listen to the comments of members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think what has shone through the debate is that the Kokoda Track campaign is unique in Australia's history not only for its importance&mdash;had Kokoda and Port Moresby fallen, the Japanese would have had a launching pad to enter northern Australia&mdash;but also because the battle was fought so close to Australian shores, not in some distant part of the globe on the other side of the world. In fact Papua New Guinea was Australian mandated territory at the time. Also what needs to be emphasised is that we fought this campaign without any direct allied support. We fought it entirely on our own, which makes it different from other battles, such as Gallipoli.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to emphasise to the government ministers&mdash;the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) and the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan)&mdash;that the suggestions that I and others have made here today are simple. They would cost very little, if anything at all. I also stress that they would be done only in conjunction with liaising with the Papua New Guinea government and with the Koiari people to work out what is best. At the very least, we could set up a few plaques on the battle sites and grave sites along the track. We have no shortage of metal and ribbon in Australia and it would cost virtually nothing to strike a few medals for the remaining fuzzy wuzzy people and their families that survive them. That is virtually all they ask. It costs absolutely nothing in the overall scheme of things and they would be so proud to wear those medals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In setting up the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angel Health and Education Foundation, only a handful of villages are involved. If we are worried about the cost, we could redirect some of the present foreign aid which, as I mentioned earlier, presently stands at $320 million a year, towards these projects. So much could be done to create such goodwill between our two countries, to repay the debt at so little cost. I know of no other opportunity where we can do this with another country as that which presents itself here today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To think that we have left this for 55 years is strange indeed. I for one am puzzled as to why it has not happened before. If we put effort into this, it can only redress our debt from the past and help enrich our history. I think the publicity that it would get and setting up the sister school relationships between Australia and the Koiari people would help stamp on our modern history the great contributions that we have made in the past. Too often we learn of other countries' histories in great detail&mdash;like the battle of Waterloo, what happened at Alamo and so on&mdash;and we neglect our own history, which is even richer. What would the Americans have done if they had had a Kokoda campaign in their war? It would be revered in television documentaries throughout the world and be shown on our screens and repeated on a monthly basis. Yet until now we have done virtually nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a great deal that we can do for little cost that will commemorate the great deeds of the past and also, in a meaningful way, help those people&mdash;the fuzzy wuzzy angels, the Koiari people,&mdash;who helped us in their thousands along the Kokoda Trail, the Kokoda Track, 55 years ago.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week I had the honour of presenting the civilian service medal to Mr Roy Hilly of Riverstone in my electorate of Greenway. The civilian service medal recognises the service of civilians who served in Australia during World War II in organisations that were subject to military like arrangements and conditions of service in arduous circumstances in support of the war effort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Roy was working at Burrinjuck in 1941 when he was given a few hours notice to pack his bags. Roy had to take his wife, Vin, and their two small children to his mother's place 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1683"> at Bowning about 40 miles away. Travelling to Tocumwal, Roy worked on aerodrome construction then moving onto Charters Towers where Roy and his team worked for next 12 months on road construction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They worked mainly with pick and shovel&mdash;there was very little machinery available at the time. The work was hard; the men worked 12 hours a day and sometimes in extreme heat up to 116 degrees. On other occasions, the team was flood bound for weeks on end without fresh food. The work affected Roy's health and after 12 months he was discharged medically unfit. After being discharged, Roy continued his war effort by working as a tradesman fitter at St Marys munitions factory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia owes a debt of appreciation to people like Roy Hilly and his wife, Vin, for their particular war effort during those dark days of World War II.

Imagine living in a world where your most powerful biological instinct makes you a social outcast, a sinner and a criminal. If the gay mardi gras were a heterosexual event, I would not attend as long as genitals were on display and nuns were being lampooned. Unfortunately, it provokes feelings of anger in a section of the community that needs instead the nurturing of tolerant understanding.</PARA>

I would gladly support a dignified campaign to overcome the injustices endured by homosexual people. Respect for the causes taken up by homosexual people will, however, be enhanced when they lead by example rather than by trying to shock us into them.

<ANSWER PAGE="1686" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for the question and I take the opportunity of explaining to the House the basis of the decisions taken by the government in relation to legal aid. I know that those decisions have been the subject of some criticism 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1687"> by state Attorneys-General and by members of the legal profession; and I want to say something of those criticisms because they are unfounded, unreasonable and completely ignore the basis of the decision that has been taken by the coalition government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it clear that we will not be changing the funding decisions that we have made in relation to legal aid. I would remind the House that the current arrangements with the states and territories are some 10 years old. The previous government made grand statements about improving access to justice; yet, in reality, that did not occur under their administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government that we succeeded in this House did not address the fact that there was a steady decline in the number of matters arising under Commonwealth law being funded by the then current legal aid arrangements. Federal money was being used increasingly to fund legal aid matters under state and territory law, particularly in the criminal law area, and areas of Commonwealth responsibility such as family law matters were pushed down the list as far as priorities were concerned. Upon taking office, we asked why this should be so and we determined that it need not be if the Commonwealth could reassert its priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We gave the required 12 months notice to terminate the legal aid agreements last June. It should be remembered, as the Attorney-General pointed out last week in relation to a well-publicised drug charge against a man in New South Wales, that we are still operating under those agreements and we have not reduced the funding available to legal aid commissions in the current financial year. It follows from that that much of the confected outrage of some state Attorneys-General is completely erroneously based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: there has been no reduction in Commonwealth legal aid funding in the current financial year, and the hypocrisy of the New South Wales Attorney-General in particular on this matter in relation to the Marini case has been exposed. We estimate that tens of millions of Commonwealth dollars have been siphoned off under the present arrangements to fund legal aid schemes for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> state matters. In some major jurisdictions, our estimate is that some 25 per cent of Commonwealth grants have gone to fund state matters. In Western Australia, the estimate is that nearly 50 per cent of the Commonwealth grant has ended up funding state matters, particularly crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth accepts responsibility for its criminal laws and, for example, is working hard and successfully to stem the importation of drugs into the country. You will not see us then walking away from our responsibility to provide funds for legal aid for serious Commonwealth criminal matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basis of the Commonwealth's decision is justified on every count. We will fund those matters which involve a responsibility under Commonwealth law. We expect the states to do the same in relation to responsibilities under state law.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did see the Treasurer's remarks. I must say that I have not had a chance to discuss them with him in any detail. The fact of the matter is that I often see quotes from my colleagues making points which the government itself, more generally, has made about the importance of flexibility. In fact, if you go back in time, this opposition itself once claimed that its policy was to increase flexibility so as to give people more opportunities to do deals by which they could earn higher pay. So it is hardly surprising that the Treasurer should talk about it being important to make it easier for people to enter into an employment relationship. He is absolutely dead right. Not only is he dead right but, in this matter, we have taken giant strides to make it easier for people to enter into those very same arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst we have been consistent with what we have been saying in terms of what we have implemented, the interesting thing is the backward steps being taken on the other side on this very issue. The shadow minister was out last week basically attacking the idea of individual contracts. His policy position is to say, `We will not regress to where we were in March 1996,' yet in November 1995 the former Prime Minister told your caucus that your policy position was to give people the opportunity where they so desired, subject to a safety net, to enter into individual contracts. The reason he did that was that it is a pathway to greater flexibility. So not only did I see the comments of the Treasurer but I totally endorse them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. I did see the survey of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which was reported this morning, on business expectations for the March quarter. That survey said that, while there had been a strong lift in business confidence during 1996, this had not until now been translated into an improvement in the actual level of activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latest survey results show that not only is confidence improving but so too are actual outcomes. The survey also reported that the expectations data show that current improvement is expected to continue&mdash;expectations of an even better performance in the quarter to come for general business conditions, sales, exports, profits, employment and investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The survey was not unequivocal, however. It did go on to say that there are, as always, many threats to the continuation of recovery. It named as the biggest threat the ACTU's living wage claim. The small business community and the business community generally in Australia are concerned about the prospect that the ACTU with an irresponsible claim&mdash;if it were granted&mdash;would have the capacity to choke off the monetary policy which has been put in place and to choke off the growing investment and recovery as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, coupled with the January balance on goods and services&mdash;a better than expected result of $63 million: in those figures announced today exports of goods and services rose one per cent to reach their highest monthly level&mdash;confirms a good investment outlook in the December CAPEX quarter, showing that expectations for 1996&hyphen;97 business capital have risen.</PARA>

This accords with the government's outlook in relation to a gradual pick&hyphen;up in the housing cycle over the course of 1997, strengthening in business investment, continuation&mdash;subject to the ACTU's claim&mdash;of a low inflation environment, three reductions in official interest rates kicking in over the course of this year and strengthening in activity.

From 1998, employers will be able to choose their training provider&mdash;something that Labor barred them from doing. I have recently announced the one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shops led by industry to fast&hyphen;track training approvals and fill vacancies. The new national training packages are being designed and endorsed by industry and already the government has launched new industry design traineeships in five key rural sectors and in office administration.

Is he also aware of the Industry Commission's report which showed that the government was spending $560 million per year on health rebates to save $240 million? Does he recall Mr Kennett's comments that the government's private health insurance incentives were `money down the drain'? In the light of these comments, how can the Prime Minister claim that spending $600 million per year on health rebates will deliver better value to the Australian people than directly spending that money on public hospitals?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition has asked me this question. Let me deal with it seriatim. First of all, can I take Mr Kennett's contribution. Yes, I do remember what he said last week. I also remember what he said in September of last year, and there is quite a gulf between the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1693"> two of them. He was right in September; he was wrong last week. The initiative that was announced by the government is a good initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also intrigued that the Leader of the Opposition should talk about the impact of incentives and rebates on keeping people in private health insurance, because it was your&mdash;not erstwhile, but continuing&mdash;friend Graham Richardson who argued in 1993 that if you allow the number of people in private health insurance to fall below a certain level you create a problem. What Graham Richardson told you and what you ignored when you were a minister in the last government was that you should have brought in tax relief years ago. What you are saying to me now is that something you should have done years ago should not now be done. It is a completely erroneous proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the Australian Medical Association, I hope that the Australian Medical Association rejects root and branch the recommendation of its vice&hyphen;president, Dr Brand. I thought it was one of the less responsible utterances of the Australian Medical Association. Continued support for private health insurance is a very, very necessary element of a sustainable health policy. I think it is a very irresponsible form of comment for a person holding such a position in the Australian Medical Association, without offering a comprehensive alternative&mdash;because they do not like the attitude of the private health insurance fund&mdash;to endeavour to create by their remarks a lack of confidence in a system which they know depends on a proper interaction of the public and the private.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line of the health debate is that for 13 years you deliberately ran down private health insurance in this country. Year after year, you took away the struts, you took away the bed day subsidy for private hospitals, you weakened the reinsurance pool and you refused&mdash;despite Graham Richardson's advice&mdash;to provide subsidies to keep people in private health insurance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. There is actually a range of activities within my portfolio which involve Aboriginal people. I do not have time to go through them all but I am happy to touch on a couple of them. Members may recall that last year I launched an Aboriginal landcare facilitator program to involve indigenous communities in landcare activities. Under that, nine Aboriginal landcare facilitators were set up to work with communities and individuals to increase awareness and activity in sustainable land management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conjunction with Senator Herron, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I am currently developing a rural industry strategy to help address the socioeconomic and environmental issues which impact on the development and sustainability of indigenous industries and enterprises. The strategy will be finalised later in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> year. It is being designed to assist Aboriginal people to become economically empowered to move towards greater self-sufficiency and self&hyphen;reliance, particularly in rural areas where many of course live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example of the type of program which may emerge from this development can be found in a pilot project for young Aboriginal people in the Gilgandra district of western New South Wales. Senator John Herron and I travelled to Gilgandra towards the end of last year to talk with local people about some of the problems that they are experiencing and to collect some of the views of the locals. At that meeting, the Aboriginal leaders spoke of their wish to establish meaningful programs which would help give the young people some self-esteem, worthwhile activities and a sense of pride and purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of that meeting, through the rural communities access program the government will be supporting the establishment of a market garden at Balladoran, some 18 kilometres from Gilgandra, a site which already has a sense of place for local Aboriginal people. The market garden will provide training opportunities for young people to learn the necessary horticultural skills to grow vegetables and native foods. It is hoped that this will engender a real interest by these young people in a career in agriculture in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many in this House would also be aware, the rate of diabetes is unacceptably high in Aboriginal people and their communities, and a contributing factor is poor diet.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard, we face some major challenges as a nation. There are no easy answers but, to begin the long journey of change, we must be prepared to take the all-important first step.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. On 8 October last year I advised the House that the ministerial council had decided to ban the import of non-child&hyphen;resistant disposable cigarette lighters from 1 March 1997, with domestic sales of these lighters prohibited from 1 July 1997. This decision was taken after analysis of injury data which showed a significant safety risk to young children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Commonwealth minister responsible for Customs, I can advise the House that import controls under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations were implemented on 1 March, on schedule. On 26 February, regulations establishing a new consumer product safety standard were gazetted. The consumer product safety standard adopts the United States standard for child resistance, which has been in place since 1994. Importers will need to make a declaration that a certificate of compliance to the United States child&hyphen;resistant standard has been issued. Manufacturers already provide such certificates for lighters imported into the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the standard was being developed, I consulted with organisations representing importers and retailers on the timing of the domestic sales ban. I received a number of representations from small business seeking an extension of the deadline, on the grounds that the original cut&hyphen;off date of 1 July 1997 did not provide sufficient time for retailers to dispose of their existing stocks.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will put in place a balanced and integrated oceans policy ranging across all jurisdictions. This will provide certainty for both industry and the marine environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government believes one can reconcile the environment and development. There can be balance. This is exactly what we are doing with the forests. And this is what we will do with the oceans that surround our island continent. The government supports the principle of multiple resource use for our natural resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, industries related to our ocean resources are worth around $30 billion a year. However, any exploitation of the resources must be responsible. It is simply not sensible to excessively exploit these resources. Such a strategy is damaging both to the environment and jobs. It would lead to a running down of stocks, reduced biodiversity, reduced production and so potentially rising unemployment. The best way to ensure long&hyphen;term growth in the industry is effective manage 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment of resources. The multiple use of resources will combine sensible exploitation of resources with environmental care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The oceans policy I outline today will cover issues such as improved fisheries management, monitoring, surveillance and control. It will also canvass the development of a representative system of marine protected areas. While we support multiple use, there will be some very special areas of outstanding environmental value that should never be disturbed. We will protect them accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Regional Cooperation</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">South Pacific Forum&mdash;Strengthening Fisheries Management in the Western and Central Pacific</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our neighbours, especially in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific, share the resources of the region's oceans with us. It is simply not possible for any one country to achieve effective management of these resources in isolation. Marine resources and problems do not recognise international boundaries. The region's small island states rely heavily on the oceans' resources and its bounty. Its long&hyphen;term viability must therefore be protected. Placing more resources in Pacific fisheries management is an important part of this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to announce today that Australia will significantly increase support for regional fisheries management in the western and central Pacific Ocean. An additional $1.15 million will be provided by the government over three years. This initiative will support South Pacific fisheries agencies promoting the sustainable development of their marine resources. In particular, the additional $1.15 million will:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This regional effort will be an important support of our own domestic efforts on oceans.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Sustaining Australia's Remote Area Fisheries</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must also be able to protect our fisheries interests in our remote waters. Illegal fishing is a threat to the livelihood of our fishermen. It is also a threat to the environmental sustainability of the oceans. It is time Australia stopped tolerating these illegal activities. The minister responsible for fisheries, Senator Parer, will announce today a $400,000 program for improving the management and surveillance of our remote area fisheries. This new strategy will include the development of satellite based imaging for monitoring fishing vessels.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Fisheries management and bycatch</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Marine life is an important source of national income for Australia. Our fisheries contribute around $1.6 billion to Australia each year and employ some 25,000 Australians. We have the third largest fishing zone in the world. Nonetheless, we are not in the top 50 nations for fish take. While our marine living resources are biologically varied, they are not plentiful. In many areas they are in a delicate balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Past approaches to fisheries management have not always recognised this. Stocks of some valuable resources&mdash;such as southern bluefin tuna&mdash;have been drastically reduced. Other marine life, such as the albatross, have been under threat from significant bycatch&mdash;the fish and marine life caught by chance when fishing boats are fishing for other species.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Albatross</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many thousands of albatross are killed each year by fishing practices which can be modified. Our Australian tuna fishing industry is working well with the government to reduce this threat. However, action must be global if it is to be successful. The government has nominated 11 species of albatross to be protected internationally. This will lead to regional conservation agreements to reduce the threats they face, saving them from becoming seriously endangered.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Fisheries Bycatch Reduction Initiative</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reduction in bycatch in Australian fisheries is essential for sustainable fisheries management. This will help conserve marine biological systems and protect populations of vulnerable species. It will provide greater long&hyphen;term resource security to industries and communities which rely on fishing. Today, I am pleased to announce a $440,000 fisheries bycatch reduction strategy to address this important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The objective of the bycatch policy will be to minimise the volume of bycatch taken by fishers, particularly species of conservation significance. The policy will develop mitigation measures such as trawl efficiency devices and bird scaring lines. We will review management of our fisheries so that measures incorporate bycatch reduction strategies and do not encourage discarding. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority will finalise the policy by the middle of the year. The policy will be the starting point for action plans for each Commonwealth fishery. This will become a key component under the Australian oceans policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Industry development</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Offshore Oil and Gas</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fishing is an industry with centuries of tradition. Offshore oil and gas exploration is very much a product of our times and is still in the early stages of its development. The future of the Australian offshore oil and gas industry looks very bright indeed, with new developments worth several billion dollars beginning on the North West Shelf and in the Timor Sea. The industry currently contributes around $8 billion to the national economy. All Australians benefit from this industry, through jobs, exports and taxation payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Oil and gas are not renewable resources. To maintain the benefits from the industry we must continue to discover and develop new fields. The economic importance of offshore oil and gas exploration and development will be given due recognition in the further development of our oceans policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Tourism</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As all members are aware, our oceans provide an important resource for tourism and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1701"> recreation. Our coasts and oceans are major attractions for tourists, who contribute approximately $15 billion a year to the Australian economy. This creates considerable regional employment as well as aggregate national wealth. Tourism must have an equal chance to grow alongside other uses of our marine environment. Resource use decisions must recognise its importance, including the importance of recreational fisheries. The oceans policy will examine issues such as development of multiple use principles, current problems and ways to improve management regimes for this important sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Marine science and technology plan</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a nation we also have an enviable reputation for marine science and technology. However, unless we have a well focused marine science sector, our conservation and resource development efforts will be poorly guided. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) is developing the marine science and technology plan as part of the overall oceans policy. The plan will set government priorities, consolidate the marine science effort and raise options for a closer working relationship with those industries which depend on the oceans' resources.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Emerging Industry Opportunities</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The resource base of our oceans is vast&mdash;around twice the area of the Australian land mass. In the longer term, our oceans have enormous potential for development in ways which are only just emerging. For example, the majority of anti-cancer drugs currently being tested are derived from marine organisms. Highly effective sunscreens for humans can be derived from coral. Australia's marine biological diversity has the potential to add great value to the pharmaceuticals industry. The possibilities of the seabed as a source of mineral wealth also remain to be assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will support innovative and responsible industrial use of our oceans, which can coexist with essential environmental values. In recognition of this, our policy will examine issues such as the adequacy of existing data, resources survey, marine science and the integration of data.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Marine pollution and ballast water</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Pollution</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full benefits from commercial development of our ocean resources will be available only if the marine environment is protected from pollution and pests. It is too easy to focus on dramatic and obvious ocean pollution such as oil spills. The greatest threat to the marine environment is from the land, which is the source of approximately 80 per cent of marine pollution. The oceans policy will canvass issues such as nutrient flows from rivers, environmental performance of sewage systems, oil spill responses and gaps in management regimes for pollutants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today Senator Hill will be announcing details of a $6.4 million coastal and marine planning program to fund integrated planning and management of coastal and marine environments. State and local governments will be invited to submit proposals to reduce pollutants and minimise the impacts of uncoordinated coastal development.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ballast Water Initiative</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of foreign pests also represents a serious threat to our ocean environment. The balance of ecosystems around our coasts is very easy to tip.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see this when foreign organisms are brought into our waters in ships' ballast or attached to ships' hulls. While oil spills can be dramatic, foreign marine organisms are more insidious. By the time they are noticed it is often too late to exterminate them&mdash;and they can do permanent environmental and economic damage. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We are only too well aware of the problems of controlling foreign marine organisms.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Northern Pacific Seastar&mdash;now a serious pest threatening the Tasmanian shellfish industry&mdash;was probably brought here in a ship's ballast water.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Fan worms from the Northern Hemisphere are spreading in Port Philip Pay, threatening its $15 million scallop industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In all, at least 55 foreign organisms have become established in Australian waters. Well over 90 per cent of Australia's trade in goods is transported by ship. As international trade increases we must take stronger action to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1702"> minimise the threat from foreign organisms in ballast and on hulls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shipping industry has agreed to an industry levy to fund a strategic ballast water research program. We welcome this most warmly. Legislation establishing the levy will be introduced into the parliament to allow its operation in 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To bridge the gap until the industry levy comes into effect, I am pleased to announce the government will provide $1 million in 1997&hyphen;98 to fund the program. This objective will be to design and implement a cost&hyphen;effective system for managing ships' ballast water based on risk assessment. This will allow us to assess the risks posed by vessels, taking account of the port of uptake and the treatment of ballast water en route. This system will be based on considering risks in relation to target organisms of concern to Australia. This will build on current guidelines requiring ships to exchange ballast water at sea.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Community participation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government will take the lead in putting Australia's comprehensive oceans policy into place. But a partnership with other governments and the Australian people is essential if the policy is to turn words into action. With the benefits that come from our oceans, so comes a duty of community care. In the last budget, the government doubled funding for community coastal projects to $3 million. This, at a time of tight fiscal discipline, was recognition of the priority the government gave such projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Parer will today announce the details of the fisheries action program, a community based program that will help protect and restore Australia's fish habitats. The fisheries action program will provide funding, on a dollar for dollar basis, for activities such as fish habitat restoration and protection, and aquatic pest control. The project will be delivered in partnership with the state and territory governments. This government will spend $9.75 million in the program over the next five years, including $3.75 million for projects in river catchments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Conclusion  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The oceans cannot provide unending bounty while absorbing our uncontrolled waste for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ever. With the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, we will start to protect and develop our oceans' natural capital as a resource for all of the Australian people. This government is dealing with the issues concerning the environment not only in relation to the oceans but also in other areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can never claim that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) lacks a sense of hyperbole whenever he speaks in this place. Everything he stands up 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1703"> to say in this chamber is usually the announcement of a mouse clothed in an elephant's skin. That is the approach of the Prime Minister to just about every single policy issue that he confronts in this place, be it on schemes like work for the dole where 800,000 unemployed people get a mickey mouse proposition for 3,000 of them, and it relates now to this issue here on the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, you ought to note this thing about this statement: it is not a statement on the environment. At very best it is a `work in progress'. It is an announcement of a series of studies. It is an announcement of a series of studies against a background of a great deal of work. The Prime Minister is not always churlish, but he is from time to time. He was churlish on this point when he said no work had been done. The basis for this lies in a whole plethora of activities by the previous government, a whole series of programs and not just programs assessing whether or not programs are necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to look at the problems identified and what ought to be the approaches to them, all I would recommend to people would be that they pick up a copy of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State of the environment: Australia</EMPHASIS>, a report that was put in place by the previous government. The consultative processes that the Prime Minister now talks about essentially were gone through and, as a result of that, a series of propositions were put down on the marine environment, among others, about the sorts of things he ought to be looking at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that ought to be noted about this is that the Prime Minister sells this as a proposition for $1.2 billion worth of new spending on the environment. That is untrue. They went through the last election campaign with a set of propositions about that Natural Heritage Trust fund in which they said, `This will be in addition to what has been spent on the environment by the previous government. This is new policy. This is new spending. These are new things that the government is going to be doing. This is our taking a commitment on the environment one giant leap forward from where the Labor Party is.' I will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say a bit more about that a bit later if I get time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I must say this: the cat was belled on this one or the milk was spilt&mdash;whatever way you want to put it&mdash;in that Senate estimates committee process last week when the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our objective was that the trust fund would be . . . additional money . . . on the forward estimates. Since the election the forward estimates have had to be reduced . . . to reflect savings . . . to some extent, the trust may be called upon to pick up&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">lapsed programs. `To some extent'&mdash;we will see the `some extent' here. Virtually every single proposition, which is actually a policy announcement as opposed to a proposition to think about a policy announcement somewhere down the track, is in fact a pick&hyphen;up of an abandoned program. Claims are made in a couple of instances that more money is going to be spent than was previously spent and in fact it constitutes a substantial, not to say dramatic, reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We actually do get some propositions about what might be done because this is a statement full of very fine words about the nature of our marine environment, a statement full of very fine words indeed, but when in fact invited to match it with an appropriate sum of money to deal with the problems let me take just one example&mdash;and that is the research related to the environmental impact of the fisheries project and what has to be put in place. It was a fine statement made about the fishing industry. You cannot argue with that statement. He was absolutely accurate when he talked about its value to the country&mdash;$1.6 billion&mdash;and to help preserve this a $400,000 fishing program over three years. What a little ripper. What a bonzer little performer: $400 grand for the environmental examination of something worth $1.6 billion to us a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is very important because he pointed out in his statement that we have the third largest fishing zone in the world, but in fact that only states the half of it. We also have the longest coastline of ice&hyphen;free water. We are far larger in that regard than Russia, China, Brazil or the US. We do have a few responsibilities in that area, a few responsibilities that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1704"> need to be met, but pardon us for saying that the world's greatest environmental program manages to find from within it $400,000 and we are allowed a degree of sarcasm and cynicism as related to their intentions in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this document, in so far as it is any good, reflects an extension of the things that we were doing. In so far as it promises anything at all, it is going to rely very much on a process of consultation. That process of consultation is of a piece with this Telstra fund. Let me talk a bit about this Telstra fund, which is after all the father, if you like, of the resources to come out of this. It is $700 million for five environmental and sustainable agricultural projects over the next five years, $300 million to be held in trust in perpetuity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our calculations indicate that cuts to the environment and sustainable agricultural budgets result in the Natural Heritage Trust Telstra money providing only around $84 million a year in additional funds on top of Labor's budgeted commitments rather than the much trumpeted additional $1 billion promised by the coalition at the last election. This leaves the question: where will the recurrent funding for the environment be when the bulk of Telstra money, barring ongoing interest from $300 million in trust, is spent in five years time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of what we were doing when we were in office was gradually building up that budget recurrent commitment to the environment. We did not assume that this particular problem was going to disappear in three years time, four years time, five years time, 10 years time or whatever. We were not taking $1.2 billion out and saying, `That is the totality of our commitment. That is going to be it and no more. We draw your attention to that and nothing else. Think of nothing else associated with it.' We were building it into recurrent programs; we were not making it hostage to the sale of a particular item in government ownership, namely, Telstra, and, therefore, by logic, out of consideration when recurrent spending comes for consideration for budgets three, four or five years down the track. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a heck of a lot of pea and thimble trick about this particular proposition and about the environmental fund overall. Nothing about the operation of that fund gives us any confidence either. We have already seen $115 million of it dragged out for the acquisition of and preservation of Tasmanian voting opportunities in the Senate. Then we have seen $300 million slung to Richard Court during his last campaign in Western Australia. This is developing all the elements of a slush fund to be trotted out for particular political purposes when trouble indicates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What board is going to oversee this process? The board is going to be overseen by two ministers. Those are the people who are going to operate this&mdash;no expert committee or no group that has any degree of environmental expertise associated with it. Two ministers are going to be operating this particular slush fund. I do believe that we are entitled to think that more needs to be said about this than has been said by the Prime Minister so far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was our record so demonised by the Prime Minister when he chose to speak on this? He said that after one year in power the coalition would do what the ALP could not do in 13 years. I have already pointed out the survey of environmental issues reflected here. In 1995, we launched the $53 million  living on the coast initiative to protect Australia's coastline. Living on the coast included $23 million for the coastcare initiative. Coastcare was based on the landcare mode and aimed to boost community participation in coastal management and help people involved in the day-to-day management of our coastline. The budget commitment to the Commonwealth coastal policy was $6 million in 1995&hyphen;96, $13 million in 1996&hyphen;97, $13 million in 1997&hyphen;98 and $13 million in 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what happened to it this year, this program which is now re-emerging? It was cut to $8.5 million by the coalition in the budget despite an explicit promise not to do so. So that money gets replaced here. This is not new money; it is money that is replacing a set of cuts. As the Minister for the Environment said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our objective was that the trust fund would be . . . additional money . . . on the forward estimates. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1705"> Since the election the forward estimates have had to be reduced . . . to reflect savings . . . to some extent, the trust may be called upon to pick up&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">those lapsed programs. It is a pretty hefty extent in that regard. We also announced in the 1991-92 budget the ocean rescue 2000 program which supported scientific work all around the country to identify suitable sites for a national system of marine reserves. It also included the development of a national marine conservation strategy, production of a marine state of the environment report and development in cooperation with the states and territories of a national representative system of marine protected areas. We also provided $4.2 million for a national centre for research and introduced marine pests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not a bad record, building up to a position in which we announced our coastline policy. As I said, all of it was contained within recurrent expenditure on budget, not plucked out of the air or thrown into a poultice&mdash;the environmental slush fund of the Liberal Party&mdash;and then used to fund programs that would have been there but for the savings taken in the budgetary process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is entirely reasonable that we ought to have, and we would support it, the idea of a comprehensive oceans policy for this nation. We think it should be balanced and that it does what the Prime Minister says it does but that his program does not allow. Take into account our massive resources in that area and the need to effectively develop them and, at the same time, to ensure that those resources are going to be protected by appropriate preservation activity and appropriate environmental activity associated with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's speech was not just a naming of the parts. Anybody could stand up here and elucidate the various elements of our very effective exploitation of marine resources, but it is another thing to develop the programs appropriate to it. What was quite evident by what he had to say was that, by and large, this is a particular set of propositions about development of those resources. Those amounts that go into particular environmental programs specifically are very small indeed. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of it is for the altogether laudatory purpose of properly assessing what marine resources there are and working out appropriate ways of exploiting it. We should do that. Governments should do that. We were doing that when we happened to be in office. To then go and do what is part of the normal processes of government industry and scientific policy and to then claim that what you are engaged in is spending a $1.2 billion Telstra sale environmental program is another part of the generalised deceit underlying this particular proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course we should be exploiting our marine resources. Of course the appropriate exploitation of them ought not to be part of this process but a multiplicity of other things. An environmental program should be, in the first instance, front and centre, a program about the environment. Industry policy and scientific policy ought to pick up the other areas of that activity if you are going to get full environmental value from a $1.2 billion program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we do this. I have already mentioned one particular statistic that puts our fishing zone into perspective and I could talk about a few others in that regard. There is no doubt: one thing about Australians that is commonplace but not easily understood or accepted by Australians is that, far from being a bush people, we are a maritime people and a coastal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We live on the coast; we exploit the coast for a whole variety of purposes; we survive by our capacity to trade; and we survive by the resources that we exploit in the seas around us. Something that anybody who plans Australian cities knows is that we all deviate as often as possible, if it is not to the hills then it is to the coast. That is where Australians want to live; that is where Australians take their enjoyment; and long may that continue. It is an entirely understandable and very appropriate orientation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it does impose upon us a very substantial burden. Here I think the Prime Minister ought to restructure his advice in this process and give some substance to his consultative process. Since this is all about consultation and not actually about policy, let us put a bit 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1706"> of flesh on the consultation. The consultation ought to incorporate within it a capacity for people who have genuine expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest to the Prime Minister that he set up either an agency or a committee that is associated with it to receive the sorts of submissions and identify for him the things that he ought to be negotiating with state governments, local governments, foreign governments, industry groups and agencies. I think it would be a very good step on his part to put some system into it, because currently the operation of this entire environmental package has a very big question mark over it&mdash;left in the hands of two ministers as it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Then I think the Prime Minister ought to start taking a look at the international cooperative elements when addressing oceans policy. This is a very important area of potential Australian foreign policy initiative. There is a need for an organisation to coordinate the free exchange of timely oceanographic information at the international level. Whereas meteorological data is widely shared and coordinated by one UN body, the World Meteorological Organisation, oceanography has the involvement of three UN agencies with huge gaps in the middle. Yet free international exchange of such information is vitally important to healthy oceans around the world on issues such as shipping lanes, offshore boundaries, waste dumping, tourism, mining and fishing. I might add that Australian scientists are leading the world in understanding some of these issues, particularly the impacts of ocean on climate&mdash;an issue only recently properly understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a role for Australia here, Prime Minister, if we are going to utilise effectively the expertise in this country, to recognise that of course the oceans wash everybody's shores, not just ours, and what other people do is critical for us as well. I would take that a point further. I was talking then about a potential UN initiative, a world marine agency effectively like the meteorological one. But I think there is also room for an initiative in this area both within APEC and through the ASEAN regional forum in the light of potential confidence building measures. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASEAN regional forum is one of the most interesting indigenously developed operations at the moment. I notice the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) is nodding his head on this, and well he might since he now has some responsibilities in that regard. The ASEAN regional forum is an organisation looking for opportunities to settle the minds of people in the area about their claims upon each other by some form of functional integration, and ocean issues are quite critical in that regard, particularly in the South China Seas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an opportunity for the Prime Minister, through his foreign minister, his defence minister and his trade minister, to start building into the ASEAN regional forum and the APEC process the sorts of confidence building measures on shipping lanes issues, on marine pollution issues, on marine exploitation issues&mdash;the sorts of things which are starting to be a source of collision between some of the states in the region immediately to the north of us&mdash;and to start to use our expertise in the oceanographic area. There are, of course, many other things that have to be done about those particular problems but, at least in this, there is an opportunity for the Prime Minister to do something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I finalise my reply by saying that this is a statement about opportunities not yet announced, work not yet done and programs of consultation very haphazardly arranged. In so far as there is anything of value in the statement, it tends to be an extension of our policy&mdash;albeit with something of a cutback. It is a real opportunity for the Prime Minister to show a bit of international statesmanship in this area by having a few new initiatives as he goes on his travels around Asia&mdash;new initiatives which build on our very considerable expertise. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>

The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is of the view that the reductions which have taken place in the tariffs to this point have not significantly cut the prices of motor cars for consumers and that to reduce tariffs below 15% will be tantamount to devastating the Australian automobile industry and destroying thousands of skilled jobs in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I gave notice of this motion on 11 February. It is interesting that there have been significant developments since it was put on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> . In particular, I refer to the fact that the federal opposition and the shadow minister have chosen to take very significant action in relation to this matter which has been coming up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I speak on this issue, I do not speak as just an interested observer. I speak as the representative of the seat of Calwell, a seat which contains the Ford Motor Co.&mdash;one of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the biggest employers and one of the biggest automobile companies in Australia. I keep in touch with the managing director and the officials at Ford. I must say that in my discussions with them I have been increasingly concerned about the trend which has occurred in relation to what may happen to the car industry if the recommendations of the Industry Commission were accepted. The reason that I decided to bring this matter before the House is that I and the majority of members on both sides of this House are very concerned about those recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One need not go into the ideological prejudices of the Industry Commission. Over a number of years, it has brought down reports which have been lacking in objectivity and have been based essentially on the presentation of one set of assumptions with respect to economic theory and the approach to the economy. Be that as it may, in this case we are not just talking about some theory. We are talking about the fate of thousands and thousands of Australian men and women who work in these industries, both in the main production plants and for component manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the adoption of the car industry plans under the Labor government, we had a period of consolidation for this industry. The industry had to cope with significant and very large reductions in protection, in tariff levels, over a period of years and an increase in imports. Indeed, imports have increased from 1984, when they were 23.6 per cent of the total passenger market, to 43.8 per cent in 1995&mdash;nearly a doubling of imports; and that trend is continuing. Under those circumstances, we are in danger of losing our industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were in danger anyway, to some degree, but the car companies decided to try to adjust to the new circumstances, to the idea that by the year 2000 there would be a reduction in tariffs to 15 per cent. Then what did we do? We have this report which basically says, `That is not enough. We will reduce them even further.' This additional reduction is critical because it will make it virtually impossible for many of these companies to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1712"> viably continue to produce motor cars in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the case&mdash;just as it has already suited some major multinational companies not to produce a single thing in Australia but to import the totality of their stock&mdash;we could have a situation in which some of our companies, including Ford, may at a given moment cut their losses and say, `Irrespective of the investment we made in Australia, it is clear that the Australian government does not support the motor car industry.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I say that we have to do something to freeze tariffs at the level of 15 per cent and that we should not go beyond that level at least until the year 2005&mdash;and, even then, only on the basis of an inquiry and an objective determination of all the factors&mdash;we get support for that view from an overwhelming proportion of Australians. Most Australians want to see a viable motor car industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who argue in favour of further reductions say that there has been some benefit for consumers. The benefit for consumers has been minimal. There has not been a significant reduction in the cost of motor cars as a result of the increase in the level of imports and the increased competition from imports. It is true that there has been increasing efficiency in the Australian industry and, as a result of that, we have been able to produce and sell cars at a level which is increasingly competitive in international terms. But, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nevertheless, when it comes to the crunch we have to think about balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of balance is a fundamental one which, unfortunately, the current government does not understand; that is, the balance between the national economic interests and the interests of international trade, the interests of the World Trade Organisation and the like. One clause in this motion says that to freeze tariffs at that particular level and to actually proceed along the lines similar to the motor car plan announced in the last few days by the federal opposition is not inconsistent with our obligations under the World Trade Organisation. Why do I say that? Because, as we have said, this matter has to be a question of looking at what we are doing and also looking at what other nations are doing, especially other nations in our region. You cannot go around saying, `Let's all have a free trade situation. Let's all reduce our tariffs,' when the only country that is actually doing a substantial amount in the car industry area is Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have done enough in this area. It is time for other countries to pull their weight. The Ford Motor Co., in its submission to the Industry Commission, had a table headed `APEC developments on market liberalisation'. The facts in this table are very valid.

There are, however, a range of views across the parliament about the assistance that the industry needs to enable it to continue its operations in Australia.

But, as it is a five&hyphen;part motion, I will address each part on its own merits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no doubt, as the first part of the motion states, that the Australian automotive industry is now an efficient industry, competitive on the world's markets because its products are highly competitive in terms of both price and quality. Part of the requirement for achieving this efficiency is attaining the volume necessary to reach optimum production levels. It is this issue of volume that is critical to the industry's continued existence in Australia and thus its capacity to employ Australian workers. Another vital factor in regard to the performance of the wider manufacturing sector is the impact of the technology developed in the automotive industry on the wider manufacturing base. The effect of the loss of this technology on the wider sector has not received the public attention that it deserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission recognised that volume is critical to the industry in order to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1714"> achieve the efficiency that the commission's very reason for being strives for. Yet two of its recommendations&mdash;the reduction of tariffs by 2.5 per cent per year until 2004 and the cessation of the export facilitation scheme&mdash;have the capacity to wipe out the volume from underneath the industry. We must seriously face the danger that, if we accept these recommendations, one or more of the passenger motor vehicle manufacturers and of the component manufacturers will leave Australia. Those who argue that the industry is crying wolf should remember that Nissan once manufactured cars in Australia. Mitsubishi, GMH, Toyota and Ford have stuck it out and, because they have, over 200,000 Australians are employed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the motion asks the House to express its concern about the majority recommendation to reduce tariff protection to five per cent by 2004. Toyota's president, Mr Sam Komori, predicted last week that all four Australian car manufacturers will be forced to close if the federal government accepts the majority report recommendation on tariff reduction. There can be no other explanation for this recommendation other than that it is driven by the ideological preference of the Industry Commissioners because it ignores much of the reality acknowledged in the report itself. It completely ignores the fundamental reality of competition for investment within the multinational automotive companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economic rationalism is becoming our nation's newest form of cancer. It has pervaded Canberra's bureaucracy to a degree that has distorted the effectiveness of the advice that government receives because of its failure to incorporate broader social, political and geographic factors effectively, if at all. We should all be mindful of the fact that the Australian operations of our car producers amount to around one per cent of their global operations and that the very fact that they continue to invest in their Australian operations delivers over 200,000 jobs in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very sad fact that Australia does not have complete sovereignty over its automotive industry. The fact that I wish we did will not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> change the fact that we do not. It is this point that the Industry Commission ignored and it is this point, apart from its flawed economics, that destroys the arguments for the majority recommendations. Our car manufacturers compete for investment from their parent companies, many of whom are already producing in other countries in our region, where they enjoy much higher levels of assistance and protection from governments and where they can directly supply the demand of much larger populations than Australia's. If the parent companies do not continue to invest here, there won't be an Australian automotive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third part of the motion expresses concern about the Chairman of the Industry Commission taking to the streets and publicly advocating the reduced tariffs recommendation while simultaneously stating that he will produce an objective final report. I suspect that the question of objectivity is in the eye of the beholder. There is no way that many of us in this House will ever accept that the majority report is, in any way, objective. The chairman would have to do a complete about&hyphen;face and support the minority report for most South Australian members and senators, the South Australian and the Victorian Premiers, the industry, the unions and most Australians to consider that he had produced an objective report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing that Bill Scales has achieved is to unite a most diverse group of Australians. The draft report does provide an accurate picture of the Australian automotive industry. Yet its majority recommendations impose a prescriptive response to the future needs of the industry that could destroy it. It is a text book that could be entitled, `A very detailed description of the Australian automotive industry and an economic rationalist prescription for the car industry that flies in the face of that very detailed description'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth part of the motion states that it is in Australia's national interest for car tariffs to remain at 15 per cent after the year 2000. It is not clear where the motion suggests that tariffs should go after that in light of the fact that the previous government committed the industry to a tariff level of zero per cent by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1715"> the year 2010. What is clear though is that the industry believes it needs the opportunity to take a breathing space after it reaches 15 per cent in 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report acknowledges that many of the substantial and easier reforms necessary to make the industry more efficient have been implemented due to the massive reduction of protection that it faced over the past decade or so. The report also acknowledges that many of the reforms it now faces are more complex and will be more difficult to achieve. Surely we should not hit the industry over the head with a blunt instrument to make it do in five years what it cannot do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that it is obviously in Australia's national interest that the car industry continues to operate in Australia and to ensure this the industry must be given its well&hyphen;earned breathing space after its outstanding performance in improving efficiency and quality over the past decade or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also obviously in Australia's interest that Adelaide does not become a ghost town with tumbleweed rolling down Rundle Mall and the ghost of John Wayne leaning against the deserted, dusty bar of the Grosvenor Hotel blowing on his Colt 45 after annihilating one of the thousands of feral cats that have taken control of the city. What will the rest of Australia do with us? Will the eastern states guarantee 1&half; million people employment, housing, education and health services? Does the rest of Australia consider Adelaide's demise to be a desirable social outcome? Who does Bill Scales suggest should pick up the bill for the unemployed car industry workers, and how much will it cost to rehabilitate a state that already has an unemployment rate which hovers around 1&half; points higher than the national average and has serious structural problems that it is struggling to address? This is precisely where the other fatal flaw in Bill Scales's report lies. It ignores the effects on regional communities of its recommendation to remove support from the industry. It acknowledges that the effects will be negatively felt in South Australia and says, `So what!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth part of the motion notes that the tariff reductions faced by the industry over the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> past decade have not resulted in a significant reduction in the price of Australian made cars. It also notes the view that the proposed tariff reduction could see thousands of Australian jobs transferred offshore. Neither Bill Scales nor anyone else asked my constituents how they feel about moving to Korea, Japan or the United States to follow their jobs when the board members of Mitsubishi decide to move their investment from Australian soil to any of their overseas plants and the component manufacturers who employ my constituents follow in their footsteps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an interesting motion and one which the opposition can afford to put forward because they no longer have to live up to the responsibilities of being in government. I do not like the fact that we have to wait until 12 May for a response, but we do. My primary focus as the member for Kingston is to protect the jobs of my 8,000 or so employees who derive their living&mdash;who feed, clothe, house and educate themselves and their families&mdash;from the wage they earn working in the Australian automotive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will continue to contribute in a constructive way to the debate to ensure the protection of my constituents' jobs. My government's biggest challenge is to find employment for around 800,000 Australians who are currently out of work. None of us want to have to find a further 200,000 jobs for unemployed automotive industry workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The battle for zero tariffs has been won&mdash;we are heading there in 2010&mdash;but Australia's automotive industry workers do not have to be the sacrificial lambs in someone else's ideological race to get there sooner. There is no point in Australia entering into agreements to reach a level playing field in the year 2020, when the other car manufacturing countries in our region have to reach zero, to find that we turn up at the finish line empty handed because all our cars have gone.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to support this motion relating to the car industry proposed by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). I acknowledge his longstanding interest in industry policy matters&mdash;this industry in particular. I also welcome the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1716"> statement last week by the federal Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, announcing Labor's six&hyphen;point plan for the car and component industry beyond the year 2000. The central feature of Labor's plan is to freeze tariffs at 15 per cent on motor vehicles original equipment and replacement components from the years 2000 to 2005. The plan establishes a desire to achieve a transparent method of assessing the progress made by our trading partners in lowering their tariff and non&hyphen;tariff barriers to the products of this all&hyphen;important industry and we are providing in this plan for a review at the year 2003 to assess how our trading partners are progressing along that route.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important element of that plan is the retention of the export facilitation scheme, which has been responsible for the enormous growth in component manufacturing exports from this industry. We are also proposing to continue the duty free allowance to support the domestic market value added and also to provide a supportive research and development framework for this industry to ensure that it stays competitive over the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plan is not a gift to the industry. Labor's plan calls for the industry to come to the party with further investments and jobs to the year 2005. We estimate that, with this particular plan in place, we can more than double the number of vehicle exports to 100,000 units per year by the year 2005, treble the exports of motor vehicle components to $3 billion and, of course, create some 10,000 new jobs in this vital area of manufacturing in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The part of the motion that I wish to address today relates to the regional employment implications of the Productivity Commission's recommendations with regard to this industry. The car and component manufacturing industry is of critical importance to Geelong and its hinterland as some 3,700 people are directly employed in motor vehicle manufacturing and component manufacturing in the Geelong area. When you take into account the Golden region, of which Geelong is a part, with the other great provincial city of Ballarat and its immediate environs, both those cities have over 5,000 people currently 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employed directly in automobile manufacturing and component manufacturing in Australia and in those regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very interested in the comments of the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) on this particular motion. It merely highlights the deep divisions which are appearing in coalition ranks on the very issue of where we are going to take the car industry beyond the year 2000. I contrast the attitudes and sentiments that were expressed by the honourable member for Kingston, who has substantial employment in car and component manufacturing in her electorate, with the position taken on the floor of this House by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), who has consistently advocated, well before 1993, a zero tariff proposal for this industry, which would have already seen the demise not only of Ford in Geelong but also of manufacturing employment in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also interested in the attitude of the honourable member for Ballarat, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), to this question. I happened to be in Ballarat last Friday, where I announced elements of Labor's plan. It was warmly received at the Bendix Mintex plant, which employs 730 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Ballarat got a bit testy when he was challenged by Martin Ferguson on the floor of the House last week about where he stands on this particular industry. I invite the parliamentary secretary to come clean with the electors of Ballarat and the electors that comprise Geelong and Ballarat in the Golden region and let us know exactly where he stands. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all well and good that the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) opposes the majority draft report of the Industry Commission's inquiry into the automotive industry. And I am sure the people of Calwell will be grateful for his support of the car industry, though after having their member sit on the government benches for so long they might have expected some action a little earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calwell might have tried to ensure that the Labor government delivered 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1717"> the tax reform promised the automotive industry in exchange for their acceptance of the Button plan. But cutting taxes, especially those levied on business, is clearly not in the make&hyphen;up of this man who clings so desperately to such an outdated leftist ideology. Nor did the member for Calwell lead the drive to reform industrial relations. Thirteen years of Labor government kowtowing to a union movement did little for those it was supposed to represent, and even less for the general welfare of the nation. It was left up to the coalition to bring in a new regime that will assist not the union movement but employers and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of labour still represents somewhere in the region of 21 per cent of the inputs in building a vehicle and, while productivity improvements have brought costs down, the new arrangements will serve to bring about further reductions&mdash;not by cutting wages but by increasing efficiency. But, shrill and hollow as the words of the honourable member sound in light of his role in the previous government, his motion is not totally without merit. I concur with his thoughts that, if post-2000 tariff reductions as recommended by the Industry Commission's draft report were implemented, they would have a debilitating effect on employment in his state and particularly mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to remember that in South Australia the automotive industry is as large a share of GSP as the wine and defence industries combined. I suspect that General Motors, Mitsubishi, Ford and Toyota will always maintain a presence in Australia. But the question we must ask is: what will be their role? Will they be manufacturing Australian cars and providing Australians with manufacturing jobs or will they become merely clearing houses for vehicles built in the United States, Japan or other countries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To live in Australia is no longer to live in isolation. Protectionism is dead. The automotive industry knows it and even the member for Calwell knows it. But we cannot afford to lose an industry that is so vital to the southern states. By all means, let us aim at removing the barriers in synchronicity with our trading partners. But let us not be the one to jump in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the freezing pool while our neighbours stand around and ask, `What's the water like?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calwell has expressed doubts about the likelihood of an objective final report, given the chairman's public statements. I might point out that, while there was contention between the commissioners on the tariff issue, there was agreement on the other findings. I certainly hold no brief for the draft opinions on post-2000 tariffs expressed by Messrs Scales and Rae and would hope that their final effort shows an about&hyphen;face on the issue. But far more important than any report is the response of the government and its approach to implementing the commission's findings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The automotive industry have survived myriad changes thus far. It has not been easy but they have coped, despite the broken promises of the previous government. But the responsibility is now with the coalition. Being from a state where motor vehicles represent a major part of the manufacturing base, I am well aware that governments need to make life a little easier for them during this period of adjustment. Any acceptance of a proposal to further slash tariffs without also implementing reforms to assist the industry would leave it with a massive, perhaps permanent, hangover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motor vehicle industry is important&mdash;it would be more important still if more Australians bought more new cars. As the member for Calwell pointed out, tariff reductions of the past decade have not brought prices down to a level where people are trading up with any regularity. With this government's reforms in industrial relations about to take effect, the time is ripe to take a good look at our tax system. Those who wish to abolish tariffs in the name of ideological purity will surely agree as well to abolish some of the abominable charges levied on business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that industry has been making all the moves for the past decade, it is now the turn of government. By all means, let us have a lean and mean car industry, but let us ensure that we still have one. And let us have one without the hypocrisy and cant of the previous Labor government&mdash;now in opposition&mdash;on this issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1718">

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> notes in the recommendations by Mr Bob Mansfield on the role and functions of the ABC, that a revised ABC Charter should emphasise the importance of providing services to regional Australia and the need for ABC services generally to reflect Australian regional and cultural diversity;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> strongly endorses the recommendation; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> calls on the Government to adopt the recommendation and to expand urgently the Charter accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The motion before the House in regard to the ABC charter actually calls on this parliament to change the charter on behalf of those people who live in regional Australia and looks towards having the board and all those involved in ABC management focus on the charter as it affects Australia in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very clear that, as the song goes that is sung in many of our schools now:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are one but we are many,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And from all the lands we come.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We share our dreams and sing in one voice,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`I am, you are, we are Australian.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is those sorts of sentiments that drive people in regional Australia to say, `We want to be part of what's happening in Australia.' And it is just not good enough any more for a charter not to recognise the importance of ABC radio to regional Australia. In fact, the ABC's regional role is essentially in radio. It 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> operates 34 full&hyphen;size stations and 14 similar studios in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional radio programming is more broadly based than that of ABC metropolitan stations and Radio National. It has less politics and social issues content, more music, and specific rural programs are 6.5 per cent of content. One of ABC radio's objectives is to provide a full range of radio services to all Australians and so it has expanded its coverage by Triple J to 44 regional centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is terribly important for the whole of regional Australia, and the Mansfield recommendation 6 was that the charter `be revised to emphasise the importance of providing services to regional Australia', although he did not suggest a specific form of words. Nor are we today to suggest to anybody a specific form of words with regard to changes to the ABC charter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying is that the current charter is a rounded document that allows the board great latitude in how it delivers its radio and other services across Australia. However, we are saying as a group of representatives of the people that this is no longer good enough, and there is a recommendation 6 from the Mansfield report that should be urgently implemented and changes made to the charter so that we can have a reflection of what is Australia&mdash;and Australia is formed greatly by the regions that surround our capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a problem, though, not only with the charter but with those people who are managing the ABC. It is not a direct criticism, but the first thing we want to is say is that there has not been the type of emphasis we desire for ABC regional radio. Every time there is a change it seems that regional radio is the first to get a bit of a slash or a bit of a kick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an example, Sue Howard, the current Head of Regional Services, joined the ABC in Adelaide as a general announcer in 1986. She moved back to Melbourne, her home town, to work with national radio. She has since worked with ABC Classic FM as well as for metropolitan regional radio, most recently as 3LO's breakfast presenter. In 1995 she was appointed Manager of Regional 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1719"> Radio in Victoria and subsequently manager of 3LO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She remains based in Melbourne and her role is to target, commission and deliver TV and radio services to meet local audience needs around Australia&mdash;and I emphasise the word `local'. `Regional' is used in the broader sense to incorporate local metropolitan needs, not just regional services. She has overall responsibility for ABC branches, audience research and the syndication of programs among local broadcasting outlets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an immediate change in the Gippsland area, for instance, where I have some concern, in that the afternoon program was immediately changed to a regional Victoria program. I do not know how you can have local emanating from Melbourne. When we talking about local, we talk about the floods that were in Traralgon only last year when we were able to go straight to ABC radio, straight to the spot, with Kevin Carmody standing up to his knees in water telling regional Australia and telling our metropolitan friends exactly what was happening in the country. Regional radio is not only important for that reason but it can flick from very local to very regional and then to national if need be. So there is a two&hyphen;way split in what is happening in regional radio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want the people that are now concerned with the management of services specifically to have the charter changed so they are forced to address themselves to regional radio issues and to make it extremely important. When I talk to the people in the electorates around Gippsland, they immediately say, `We are important too. We've got our hands up and we believe that we should be getting more care, because even local weather broadcasts are terribly important to the way we do business&mdash;to the way farmers do business, to the way regional business operates.' All of this encapsulates the point that we do not believe there has been enough emphasis on regional radio&mdash;and neither does the National Farmers Federation. They are saying, `We don't want fewer regional services; we want greater regional services.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Indi has a view that he needs the ABC as a critical part of his elec 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> torate, where it plays a major role. I am saying&mdash;and, I am sure, Mr Lieberman is saying&mdash;that ABC radio forms a critical part of what the future of our regions is going to be. The people in those regions need not only their universities but also ABC radio as a integral part of the strategic opportunities for regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also terribly important to the coverage of arts and cultural issues in local areas. Once again, we are talking not only about issues that may be of a business nature but also about arts and cultural issues and those issues raised by people. I met a visually impaired group of people who do a telelink service. I spoke to them and I said, `What are your other links into the community?' They said, `ABC regional radio is terribly important to us.' They were not happy with the changes that have been wrought&mdash;changes that took the afternoon program from a very, very local program to a program that went all across Victoria. I am sure that is happening across the rest of Australia. We want those people, such as Sue Howard, to have as part of the charter an instruction about the resource funding that goes to ABC radio, especially in the regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I picked up a newsletter from the Friends of the ABC today. They seem to be on the wrong side of the fence here because they are saying that the charter should not be changed and that the responsibilities that are there are fine. Can I say to the Friends of the ABC: I do not see a lot of reference to their support for regional radio in this particular newsletter. I hope there are other support mechanisms that will be coming through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the existing charter provides a reasonable framework, it is time that country people were recognised for the important role that we play in the support that is there for the cities. Yes, we are one and we are many, but we would like to be included. There is absolutely no doubt now that regional Australia has stood up and said, `In regard to regional radio we want to be addressed.' We have a great opportunity as a parliament to address the issues that affect country people by recognising them in the charter by supporting this motion. I have looked at the Mans 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1720"> field report. There are many, many people out in regional Australia who have put a great investment into the Mansfield review. There is a great opportunity for us now as a parliament to react to what people are actually saying in country areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They want to feel that their radio is local; they want to talk about local issues. When we are talking about `local', we are not talking about the whole of the state or the whole of Australia; we are talking about the regions that people live in. I am sure that, as the rest of the speakers come through supporting this motion, they will reflect the feelings of the honourable member for Indi and those people throughout Victoria who address themselves to us whenever we travel by saying, `We are looking for regional radio across Australia to inform us as to what is going on not only at a national level through their news broadcasts but certainly at a very local level.' I thank you for the opportunity to address the House and I congratulate the member for Indi on his efforts in support of regional radio. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to support the motion put forward by the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) and moved by my friend the member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent). The motion calls upon the government to act on those recommendations of Mr Bob Mansfield in such a way as to ensure that the ABC's presence and the programming which we now enjoy in rural and regional Australia remain in rural and regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was delighted to learn, on the release of the Mansfield report, that he has recognised the critical role that ABC radio, in particular, plays in rural and regional Australia. He has recognised the importance of the regular reporting of state regional and local affairs and the importance of specialised rural and related information such as detailed weather reports in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An AGB McNair survey commissioned by the New South Wales Farmers Association last year showed that four in five farmers listen to ABC radio on a regular basis. No doubt that is mainly a function of their dependence on the information they gain daily from ABC radio&mdash;information like livestock reports from saleyards and, something I have already mentioned, the all&hyphen;important regular weather information. Of course, none of this should come as a surprise to us. There have been a number of reports over many years that have highlighted the critical role that the ABC plays in rural and regional Australia. One of these reports was the Dix report of 1979.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us who live in the Hunter do not need the Mansfield report to remind us of the important role ABC radio and television play in rural and regional Australia. We have what is, I suspect, the most professional and cost efficient service in Australia in radio 2NC Newcastle and its Upper Hunter outpost, radio 2UH. Operating with only about eight staff, the Newcastle newsroom is one of the smallest in the nation that offers its own composite news bulletins which are entirely compiled and read by the newsroom and include international, national, state and local copy&mdash;but not necessarily in that order. The Newcastle team prioritises the news to reflect the expectations of the Hunter community and to reflect the priority of news in the eyes of those residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within the ABC in the Hunter we have a dedicated team who have been prepared to embrace change and to provide the same service&mdash;if not better&mdash;as that traditionally enjoyed by Hunter residents. The team in the Hunter Valley have weathered the storm of the budget cuts but they certainly are not in a position to wear any further cuts. That is why it is so important that the government move quickly to embrace Bob Mansfield's recommendations with respect to rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What intrigues me about this motion is the sudden interest being displayed by the member for Indi, the member for McMillan and indeed the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony). I have to ask the question: where were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1721"> they during the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply? Where were they in those heady days post the Prime Minister's first budget when we learned that $209 million would be cut from the ABC's budget over four years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the most sensible and most conclusive way of addressing the threat posed to rural and regional Australia would be simply to oppose the budget cuts, to stand up for rural and regional Australia for a change to ensure that that funding is restored. If government members are not prepared to do that, they have to give some trade&hyphen;offs. They have to determine what else goes if regional and rural Australia is to maintain the level of funding that it currently enjoys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have learned that the rock&hyphen;solid guarantee given by the coalition prior to the election with respect to ABC funding was one of those non&hyphen;core promises we have heard so much about. You remember the promises, Mr Deputy Speaker. They were contained in their document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better Communications</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will maintain the current prohibition on advertising and sponsorship on ABC television and radio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition is committed to maintaining the ABC's comprehensive radio network.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will encourage and support the ongoing expansion of ABC radio, including the extension of the highly successful Triple J network into regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We all know the story now. By 26 September the minister was ducking and weaving. When addressing the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts, the minister started using definitions of words to try to explain away that pre&hyphen;election commitment. He then started to suggest that `current', `existing' and other words did not always mean the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister had a little more difficultly when explaining his election night comments. It was difficult enough to explain why the government went back on the commitment contained in their document, but he had a little more difficulty responding to questions on the answers that he gave on election night to the ABC's Jim Middleton. Let me share 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the House what the minister said on that occasion. Jim Middleton asked the minister whether the pre&hyphen;election commitment to maintain ABC funding levels still stood. His response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alston: `Absolutely.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`Absolutely,' he said. The interview went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Middleton: `Even if you discover on Monday that the budget's bottom line is much worse than the government's been saying?'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alston: `Oh yes. I think John Howard's made it very plain that we want to maintain&hyphen;&hyphen;honour&hyphen;&hyphen;all our commitments and the ABC is a very important part of that.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Chris Schacht, our representative on communications in the upper house, wanted to pursue that more vigorously. In the committee he asked Senator Alston:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But after you had clearly won the election, while being interviewed by Mr Middleton from the ABC on election night, you clearly said yes in response to a question that the level of the maintenance of funding in real terms was for the term of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Alston responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think I said `absolutely' and went on to explain what I meant by all of that. If you are seriously suggesting that being sprung by Jim Middleton in the euphoria of election night should somehow be regarded as overturning a solemn policy provision which was spelt out in writing, taken right through the campaign and clearly understood, you are quite wrong.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What an absolutely amazing statement to make!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, this motion is quite timely because, as you know, we all picked up the newspapers last Friday morning and read of more impending cuts to the ABC's funding. It is all right for backbenchers on the government side to come into this place and bleat about the impact of ABC funding cuts to regional and rural Australia so they can go back to their electorates and put out a little media release to prove to all and sundry in the electorate what wonderful things they have been saying in the parliament about the ABC in regional and rural Australia, but what they should be doing is coming in here and opposing those budget cuts. That would be the best way to ensure that rural and regional Australia maintains the level of service it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1722"> currently enjoys. But at least they are prepared to come in here and do something&mdash;unlike Minister McGauran and the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) who issued media releases attacking the ABC for putting about unfounded fears as to where the ABC cuts were likely to fall as a result of these budgetary measures. How disgraceful is that? They cut more than $200 million from the ABC budget over four years and then cry poor, saying what a terrible thing the ABC is doing when it suggests cuts to regional and rural programming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that Minister McGauran and the member for Wide Bay should come into this place and oppose these budgetary cuts. As I say, that would be the most effective way of ensuring that services in rural and regional Australia will be maintained.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved by the member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent) on behalf of the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) on recommendations made in the Mansfield report on the role and functions of the ABC&mdash;specifically the role the ABC plays as an institution in regional and rural Australia. The report also addresses the need to revise the ABC charter, to ensure that regional and rural interests are clearly spelled out in the charter rather than being incorporated within its corporate plan as is proposed. That is certainly what a number of senior executives within the ABC would like to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As mentioned before, numerous reports have been made on the ABC, and these have been outlined by the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). The last major report on the ABC was in 1983. I think it is timely that the Mansfield report has re&hyphen;examined the efficiencies and direction of the ABC, bearing in mind the government's stated objectives which have partly driven the reduction in the budget allocation following the situation we inherited from the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we all acknowledge that the ABC plays a critical role but, as with all financial institutions, there has had to be a spreading of the budget deficit load that has been passed on to us. The ABC is not a sacred cow but, by the same token, we have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to show compassion, understanding and guidance, particularly in regional and rural areas of Australia, as to how the ABC will be placed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the biggest challenges the ABC will face are not only in terms of its financial arrangements and the effect they will have on regional areas but also in terms of the rapid pace of technology and the absolute change that will have right across Australia, and particularly in more remote areas. At the end of last year, Brian Johns attended a National Party meeting and he talked about the ABC and two of its strengths, which are a bit of a paradox. He mentioned that one is the ABC's internationalisation. It had extremely good coverage of international events on both TV and radio. The other side of the coin was the ABC's unique ability to localise stories and issues. It is the only network that has infrastructure right across the country. We want to make sure that that local infrastructure is retained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC, and particularly ABC radio, is a critical lifeline for communications, news, information and emergency services right across Australia. The ABC's coverage is unmatched by other stations. It has over 600 television towers and satellites across Australia covering 100 per cent of the nation. It also has 49 regional radio studios including in Lismore and on the Gold Coast. It has over 300 transmitters in a second regional network and 44 additional transmitters for Triple J. It is interesting to note that the ABC rural department celebrated 50 years of broadcasting last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ABC radio has over 6.3 million listeners and 25 per cent of that listening audience is in regional Australia. I know that my local stations, 2NR Lismore and Radio 91.7 on the Gold Coast, provide a valuable service to that region not just in the general and important areas of entertainment, culture, education and the arts but tide, weather, market, livestock and surfing reports. It is the communication lifeline to those remote communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the Mansfield report, Brian Johns guaranteed that there would be an emphasis on local radio, which I encourage. I would not like to see regional radio become the poor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1723"> cousin to metropolitan radio where there are a number of different stations and a huge number of resources. When you look at some areas in regional Australia, particularly areas in Queensland which is the most decentralised state, it is interesting to note that 15 years ago local programming amounted to 17 hours. Today it is down to six hours. Staffing levels have fallen by two-thirds over the last 15 years, which was during the period of the previous government. I think we need to draw the line somewhere&mdash;particularly in relation to those areas and communities which rely on this service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the charter is concerned, I believe it is necessary for the ABC to have the interests of regional and rural Australia enshrined in the charter. There needs to be an adequate corporate plan to dovetail with the charter. I am glad to see that when the government establishes its $250 million communications fund&mdash;obviously part of that will come from the Telstra sale&mdash;there will be an interface between the fund and regional ABC services. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion would be commendable if it was part of a wider and more detailed motion in support of the ABC. As it stands, it is merely a smokescreen of concern to cover this government's unparalleled attempt to muzzle our national broadcaster. Of course the ABC charter should&mdash;and I quote from the motion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . emphasise the importance of providing services to regional Australia and the need for ABC services generally to reflect Australian regional and cultural diversity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Anyone from regional Australia&mdash;and the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) represents the country town in regional Victoria where I grew up and went to school, so I do understand what he is talking about in this regard&mdash;and anyone who has lived away from the major cities understands the fundamental importance of ABC radio and television to their way of life and their lifestyle. Frequently, the ABC is the only broadcaster they receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasingly, it is the case that country radio and television is being networked from city stations and any local flavour is being lost. As 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, in Melbourne we are also being treated in this way. Like the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the ABC is now coming, in the main, from Sydney. The Prime Minister has moved out of the Lodge to Kirribilli and we in Melbourne are getting our evening radio out of Sydney all because of this government's cuts to the ABC. We have seen outstanding presenters from Melbourne lose their jobs and lose their local input because of this government's cuts and the move to Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC cannot discharge its charter if it is starved of the funding necessary to carry out its task. Let us remember what the government promised in its election manifesto. It said it would `maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC'. This commitment was reaffirmed on election night by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston. Yet even before the budget, the Minister for Communications and the Arts was announcing cuts of $10 million to $11 million for 1996-97 and $55 million for 1997-98&mdash;a total cut of $65 million. These cuts represent more than 10 per cent of the ABC's budget. Put another way, they represent one-third of the entire ABC radio budget or nearly 20 per cent of the TV budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What makes it worse is that further cuts in the forthcoming May budget have not been ruled out. I put it to the member for Indi that, if he were truly concerned about the quality of ABC services to regional Australia, he would be putting the government on notice not just to quarantine the ABC from cuts planned in the May budget but to make sure that funding was restored to the organisation to enable it to carry out its charter in terms of quality and access to services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the member for Indi is not prepared to do that, then what he is going to see is the ABC and regional services sacrificed on the altar of this government's budget. What we are going to see is the loss of local radio programs, local sports coverage and maybe Radio Australia, Triple J and Classic FM. It certainly goes without saying that the loss of any of these services would greatly diminish the quality of service not just to regional Australia but to all Australians. These certainly will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1724"> be the outcomes if the cuts to the ABC go through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important that we remember that this government wants to attack the independence of the ABC. We must reiterate the absolute necessity to keep an independent ABC. It is in this minister's cabinet submission that we see the admission&mdash;this is a quote from a news report&mdash;that they seek to `influence future ABC functions and activities more directly'. If we are going to have a serious discussion about the charter of the ABC, what we need to be making sure of is that the charter contains an absolute commitment to the independence of the ABC. For a healthy democracy we have to have a high quality media that can criticise without fear or favour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC must not be threatened by this government. The way the government likes to see it is, `Toe the line or you will be crucified.' That does not create an independent broadcaster. I support the motion as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to grieve for the imminent closure of 84 Medicare offices around Australia. I am standing today to raise this issue because of an exchange that took place in this chamber last Wednesday. Last Wednesday the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) mentioned in passing some concerns he had about the Labor Party seeking to speak up for the continuation of the Medicare office in Lithgow, which is in the electorate of the honourable member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After I sought some information from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) about whether the member had 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been given any assurances about the future of the Medicare office at Lithgow, Dr Wooldridge said that he would have to check. Surprisingly, after question time last Wednesday, the honourable member for Calare came into the House and made the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I claim to have been misrepresented by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who during the debate on the Private Health Insurance Bill in this place today suggested I had passed on assurances to my electorate from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) that the Lithgow Medicare office will not be closed. The minister has given me no such assurance, nor have I publicly stated he has. I issued a press release after the budget saying the minister had assured me there is no hit list of Medicare agencies . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Immediately thereafter&mdash;I am sure it was no coincidence&mdash;the Minister for Health and Family Services sought the call and said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence very briefly on this matter. This arose from a debate just before question time. Subsequent to that the member for Calare has shown me the press releases that he has put out. I have examined the press releases and I can find nothing in them that is not absolutely honest.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">People who heard that exchange might suspect that I, the member for Dobell, had unfairly suggested that the member for Calare had assured his electorate that his Medicare office would not close and that I had accused the member for Calare of saying something which he in fact never said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the day after, I received a letter from the honourable member for Calare. I have to say at this point that I am grateful that the honourable member for Calare, apparently at the first opportunity, has sought to clarify the record. He even offered to me to come into the House and put this on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record. He did admit to me that in fact he had come across an earlier press release which he had put out which was not covered by the assurances which he gave earlier. I would like to quote from the earlier press release, which reported in the Lithgow <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> on Saturday, 25 May 1996. Under the headline `Medicare closure is just a rumour', the following quote is attributed to Mr Andren:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1725">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal Minister for Health, Dr Michael Wooldridge, has assured me there are no plans to shut or relocate the Lithgow office.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Under the headline `Just word games' an article in the Lithgow <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>  on Tuesday, 13 August states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears the federal health minister has been deliberately deceptive over the fate of the Lithgow Medicare office, according to the member for Calare, Peter Andren.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article goes on to quote the member for Calare as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I sought assurances from the minister in March that the office and its staff were safe from closure, Dr Wooldridge's assistant, Dr Bob Woods, assured me that the government had no plans at present to close or relocate the office. Now it appears Lithgow will be one of 44 Medicare offices state&hyphen;wide to get the chop, with another three jobs lost in a city that has been absolutely devastated by government downsizing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, said that he had seen all the press releases which the member for Calare had put out and said, `I have examined the press releases and I can find nothing in them that is not absolutely honest,' I am not sure whether that included the press release from the member for Calare that is reported as saying, `It appears that the federal health minister has been deliberately deceptive over the fate of the Lithgow Medicare office . . . '. I would be surprised if the Minister for Health and Family Services would describe as `absolutely honest' the claim that he had been deliberately deceptive, but you would never know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand why the honourable member for Calare and other members of this House might be a bit confused about what the government is actually intending to do with Medicare offices. On budget night last year, one of the government's official documents, which was handed out with the budget papers, was a small pamphlet entitled `Recognising older Australians'. On page 19 of that official budget paper it was stated that the government intended to close 84 Medicare offices around the country. In the Senate estimates hearings in October last year we were able to obtain a number from the government, in intense questioning of the Department of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Health and Family Services. We had the government actually admitting what their timetable was for the closure of these Medicare offices around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The timetable, as announced in Senate estimates last year, was for 35 of the offices to be closed this financial year, coming to a cumulative total of 51 the following year. Further closures would come to a cumulative total of 68 by 1998-99. By 1999&hyphen;2000, a total of 84 offices would be closed right around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty we have had has been that this financial year, with about four months to go, it was expected that 35 Medicare offices would close. Yet when the officers appeared before the additional estimates last week, statements were made by members of the department of the Minister for Health and Family Services. This quote is from page CA57 of Wednesday, 26 February. Ms Wood from the Department of Health and Family Services said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would expect to be closing branches around the end of the financial year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the first 35 Medicare offices&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but whether it will be at the end of this financial year or in July, I am not sure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have been seeking to find out what the criteria will be for choosing the lucky 35 Medicare offices which will be the first ones to close. We were told last October that, despite submissions to the minister, they had not yet been able to get a decision out of the minister as to what the criteria would be for picking the Medicare offices to close. Ms Wood as recently as last Wednesday stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will be looking at finalising the criteria for closing the branches once we have seen some of the success of the pilot.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, the pharmacy pilot. More than six months after the budget was brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), we still cannot get any decision from the Minister for Health and Family Services as to what the criteria will be before these offices begin to close. I really do think it is very tardy. The killer quote is near the end of the questioning on this issue. Ms Wood was asked by Senator Neal: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1726">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Could I rephrase the question and ask: how many Medicare offices do you anticipate closing by the end of July?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Ms Wood</EMPHASIS> &mdash;I cannot answer that. I do not know at this point. We have come up with the offices that we wish to close . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For six or seven months we have been trying to get from this minister and from this government the list of offices that they intend to close. We now have confirmation that in the Health Insurance Commission they have a list of offices that they wish to close, even though we do not have any criteria which the government intends to use to decide which ones will close.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our great concern in particular is that large numbers of the smaller Medicare offices in regional and provincial Australia will be the ones hardest hit by this decision to close these offices. I am sure my colleague the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) is very concerned about the impact that this is going to have in his own state of Queensland. The largest states such as Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia will be under enormous pressure as decisions are made as to which Medicare offices are closing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Queensland is the most decentralised state of Australia, and it will probably be the state hardest hit by the number of closures per capita that will take place. For ordinary Australians who use their Medicare office, it is certainly going to make a difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, the people who live in these towns go to their Medicare office and get cash in the hand, cash across the counter. If you have to post off your claim, people understand how long it takes to get the cheque back and wait for it to be cleared. If the government thinks that in some way these new faxes in pharmacies are the answer, the do&hyphen;it&hyphen;yourself Medicare office, it has another think coming. It will certainly get a reaction from Australians who live in the towns around the country that will lose their Medicare offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that for some reason the member for Calare got an assur 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ance, the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) got an assurance&mdash;and I am sure it was totally unconnected with the fact that she had a by-election due&mdash;and the member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) got an assurance, but Labor members of parliament cannot get any assurances from this minister or this government about how the closures of these 84 Medicare offices across the country are going to affect the people who live in their electorates. The Labor opposition will continue to raise this issue because we think it is wrong for the government to be removing this essential community service. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1726"><TITLE>Children: Abuse</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I rise to tell the House about one of the most serious issues that I have faced as a member of parliament involving some of the most distressing problems imaginable facing children. Many children will never recover from the abuse that they have experienced and their recovery is often made harder by the systems that governments impose on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">State governments across the country are guilty of underfunding the agencies that are responsible for the welfare of children. The federal government is guilty of imposing an adversarial legal system on them that does not effectively recognise their rights and interests. The rights and interests of the children who appear before the court should be its first priority. It is the determination of those rights and interests and their priority in relation to the rights and interests of the adults that leads to the problems. It is my view that all governments are guilty of not doing enough to prevent the factors that lead to the abuse and neglect of children because they are not facing up to those factors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate we have some very dedicated people working with those who have experienced sexual abuse in their families. Organisations like SSAFE do some very challenging work with around 80 families in my electorate. But are these families who have come forward only the tip of the iceberg? No&hyphen;one really knows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have some wonderful general practitioners who do their best not just to write out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1727"> a prescription for the symptoms that people who have been abused suffer. They seek to get to the cause of the problem. Sadly, the causes may be embedded in the abuse that they received as children. In many cases, these organisations and the people they help are finding not just that it is the perpetrators of the abuse that will haunt the children's heads for many years to come, or indeed for the rest of their lives, but that the system they must go through is still a major impediment to their opportunity to heal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen a number of the families who have sought assistance from organisations in my electorate and their stories are very grave indeed. The problem is that the stories are often so horrendous that no&hyphen;one believes them, and herein lies a major part of the problem. The system, whether it includes parliamentarians, judges, lawyers, police officers, school teachers, health professionals or welfare workers, often fails to hear the stories because sometimes they are just too hideous to be believed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, who wants to believe that a four&hyphen;year&hyphen;old child could be anally raped by its father? Who wants to believe that a baby could be used in a bizarre ritual by a family member and the baby could suffer puncture marks to the skin in that ritual? Who wants to believe that a mother could go out to a hotel and leave her three children, all under five, with their uncle who she knows sexually molests them but accepts it because both she and her brother were sexually molested by their grandfather as children? No-one wants to believe such stories so it is easier to assume that the child made it up or perhaps that one parent made it up to prevent the other parent having access to their child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not difficult to imagine that sometimes this does occur but, in terms of the child's long&hyphen;term future and mental health, surely the focus should be on what is the right thing for the child&mdash;what does the child really want? The longer we ignore the reality that very serious abuse happens and we do not become obsessed with exposing it and wiping out its causes, the longer the children will be forced to endure a nightmare existence that they may never recover from.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have one child in my electorate whose family is about to go to what they think is their 39th court appearance, and the child's voice is still to this day yet to be heard in the court. Who knows whether or not it will be and whether the outcome will ever enable the child to recover. At the end of each court appearance, the family picks itself up and goes home, then they have to prepare themselves mentally for the uncertainty that will prevail until the next appearance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the lawyers who seek adjournment after adjournment and counselling session after counselling session write up their tabs and, in my area, it is likely that the Legal Services Commission is picking up the bill for its clients. We have the Legal Services Commission granting legal aid to adults whose children do not want to see them so that the adults can keep fighting to see them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who is asking the children, and where is the accountability from the court officers for the public money they receive or for the money they take from their clients who have no choice but to pay? The people who may know the child best outside of the family&mdash;the doctors, the welfare workers, the teachers or the school counsellors&mdash;have no automatic standing in the court to put the child's truth forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The presumption of the innocence of the alleged perpetrator wins out against any right that the child might have to be protected. Unless the alleged perpetrator is found guilty of any sort of abuse, they are likely to be granted access to the child and, if they are eligible, they are likely to be granted legal aid to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One family and community services worker told me that, in the 20 years he has been working in the business, only one lawyer whom he has dealt with has in his view actually properly informed him about the child's needs and desires before going into court to represent the child. This particular lawyer took it upon himself to interview all the people who were close to the child, including family members and health professionals who had known the child over the years. The lawyer was able to determine for himself a clear picture of what was good for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1728"> the child based on his broad understanding of the child's history. Sadly, this is not the common case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that the system is actually designed to let children down. Once their families get to the stage that they need to have their problems sorted out by the Family Court, the child has already been significantly damaged. The continued pursuit of the interests of adults through the court can lead to the child becoming even further damaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September last year, I put out a paper asking the question, `Does Australia need a Commissioner for Children?' I circulated the paper widely through the various organisations around the country that represent children, and I am very pleased with the response that I received in support of the commissioner. It seems that every paper that has ever been written looking into the abuse and neglect of children has recommended that Australia needs a Commissioner for Children, yet we still do not have one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a Commissioner for Children to be effective, they would need to be charged with the responsibility to investigate the reality that Australia's children experience and, based upon that reality, make recommendations to governments about the measures necessary to address the problems with that reality. That reality involves some horrifying statistics. In the 1994-95 financial year, 76,954 cases of child abuse were reported in Australia; 30,615 of these cases were substantiated; and 11,973 were committed by a family member, 9,479 of whom were their parents. Something is going very wrong in this country when nearly 10,000 Australians are abusing their children each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who protects these children from their own families? The answer is that the state welfare agencies are supposed to, but clearly they are failing because the abuse still occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not good enough to say that we should protect a child from an abusive parent. What our goal should be is to address the factors that lead to the parent's abusive or neglectful behaviour. In many cases, the behaviour may be triggered by external factors such as the stress of poverty and unemployment. In other cases, the abusive behaviour may be learned 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from the parent's parents, and they have simply never had an effective parenting role model. The factors are very complex, but we must not run away from them because they are too hard. Whatever the causes, solutions must be found to the factors that lead to the abusive and neglectful behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people become very concerned when the issue of children's rights is raised. There is a genuine concern in the community that the information necessarily given to school children about their rights should include some information about their responsibilities. This is a separate issue from the denial of basic rights suffered by too many of Australia's children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But who would deny children their right not to be physically, emotionally or sexually abused? Who would deny children their right to receive the best education available? Who would deny children their right to health care when they are sick? And who would deny that children have a right to live in a house with a roof over their heads with family members who care for them and who strive to provide for their physical and emotional needs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why is it that too many Australian children do not have a roof over their heads and do not have health care available to them to cure their illnesses? Sadly, our indigenous children are overrepresented in all these categories. Why is it that when the most important support mechanism for children breaks down&mdash;that is, when the child's family breaks down&mdash;the future of our most vulnerable children is placed in the hands of a court whose primary focus is not on them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not suggesting that, if we appoint a Commissioner for Children, we will wake up the next morning and everything will be just peachy with all of Australia's children. But there is no government organisation or position with the power to investigate the shortfalls in the system that is supposed to protect our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position of the Human Rights Commissioner was established under legislation passed by this parliament, and the rights that the commissioner upholds are described in schedules included in the act. It is fair to say 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1729"> that the civilised world has not come to an end because the schedules include international treaties to which Australia is a signatory. I suggest that Australia's children need someone with similar powers to uphold and protect their rights by revealing the problems within society and within the system that lead to the denial of their fundamental rights.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1729"><TITLE>National Party of Australia</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I grieve for the National Party of Australia. Black Jack McEwen would be rolling in his grave at the way in which Tim Fischer, the Leader of the National Party of Australia and Deputy Prime Minister, and the National Party generally have rolled over to the Melbourne and Sydney lawyers in the current Howard coalition government. The Melbourne and Sydney lawyers are dominating this government to the great expense of rural and regional Australia and to the great expense of the outlying states, such as Western Australia, and the outlying areas, such as North and Far North Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That this is certainly the case was first picked up as early as June last year when, in respect of proposals to cut Commonwealth programs which were of relevance to Australia generally and to companies operating in rural and regional Australia in particular, Mr Hendy Cowan&mdash;who is the senior National Party figure in Western Australia, the Leader of the National Party in Western Australia, the deputy premier of Western Australia and the state Minister for Commerce and Trade&mdash;publicly said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the Commonwealth&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">referring to the government of course&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">might need to rethink some of the programs they have decided to axe.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was referring there to DIFF and EMDG. Mr Cowan went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is going to be the only developed country which will not have an equivalent of the DIFF program.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So as early as June of last year Hendy Cowan was on to this. We saw in the budget the export market development grants program being gutted and slashed to the tune of $426 million over four years. I do not need to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> remind the House of the DIFF debacle, of the embarrassing way in which Australia's reputation was hurt overseas and of the way in which the domestic and international reputation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) was shredded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the EMDG decision in the budget, we saw the decision to remove funding for the department of regional development. We now have the minister for transport, Mr Sharp, conducting himself under the illusion of having a second portfolio, regional development. We heard public statements made at the time of the budget defending that decision to the effect that there was no constitutional role for the Commonwealth so far as regional development was concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Last week Hendy Cowan brought many of these threads together with a scathing attack on Mr Fischer&mdash;the Leader of the National Party and the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;and with a scathing attack on the National Party at the federal level generally. He complained bitterly, publicly, that the National Party&mdash;and in particular Mr Fischer&mdash;had lost its direction, was moving away from bread and butter issues and had failed to support industry in regional Australia generally. It is worth reading parts of an interview on the ABC Radio <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program of 26 February into the record. The ABC presenter starts the program by stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hendy Cowan, Western Australia's Deputy Prime Minister, says the Federal National Party has lost direction and is becoming removed from its grass roots. But his anger doesn't stop there. He says the National Party is letting rural Australia down.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COWAN: I think it's fair to say that very clearly the Federal National Party seems to me to have lost some sense of direction. It needs very much to get back to the real issues . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INTERVIEWER: Why do you say the Federal National Party has lost direction?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COWAN: For the simple reason that it seems to me that the basic and fundamental issues which are important to the National Party have been lost in the sense of making sure that the Coalition Government doesn't have any hiccups.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What is that code for? That is code for the National Party&mdash;for the Leader of the National Party and the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1730"> Fischer; for the deputy leader and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson; for Minister Sharp; for Minister McGauran; and for other members of the National Party rolling over to the Sydney and Melbourne Liberal lawyers who dominate this government to the great expense of rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Cowan went on to refer to bread and butter issues for the National Party which are the issues that need to be addressed by the National Party. He was very critical of the subject matter of the National Party's conference which was held last weekend. He went on to say in the interview:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COWAN: . . . we have to take charge of the direction in which we're going and I see the National Party as being the main vehicle for doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INTERVIEWER: Are you happy at all with Tim Fischer's performance as Leader of the Party?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COWAN: I'm not going to talk about that. That's a federal issue. I'm not a member of the federal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INTERVIEWER: Do you think he's doing an adequate job?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COWAN: Again, I'm not prepared to comment on that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So twice in the space of that interview the senior National Party figure from the outlying state of Western Australia refuses to endorse the leadership attributes of the Deputy Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that one National member of this parliament would have been entirely pleased to see those comments made, namely the right honourable member for New England, Mr Sinclair, who&mdash;it is an open secret&mdash;has been stalking the Leader of the National Party for a number of years.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">He made the point there are not any National members of the federal parliament from Western Australia. But Hendy Cowan's comment was a searing indictment of the failure of those Liberal Party members from Western Australia to stand up for Western Australia. It is reflected by the fact that not one minister from Western Australia is in the cabinet&mdash;whether it be the Attorney-General, Mr Williams; whether it be the Minister for Family Services, Mrs Moylan; or the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Prosser.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Brisbane interjects, that is entirely understandable. But coming from the great economic and population growth state of Western Australia, that is a searing indictment on the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let me return to the National Party. I indicated to the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) that over the summer break I read Black Jack McEwen's biography. Black Jack McEwen, for all his faults, at least was a person who was prepared to stand up for what he believed in and was also a person who believed that it was possible to have two thoughts in one's head at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make this point because over the summer break&mdash;at precisely the same period&mdash;I saw an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> in which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, was saying that Australia needed to return to raw commodities as its export future. We saw in the Leader of the National Party and trade minister's trade outcomes and objectives statement, which he tabled in this parliament on 5 February; we saw in the government's own work; we saw in the trade minister's own work, the very clear analysis that the trend of international 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1731"> trade continues to be in favour of manufactures, in services and in value added goods. While it is vital&mdash;and I am sure that members on both sides of the House would subscribe to this view&mdash;that we continue to be a world competitive exporter in our rural commodities as we have traditionally been, we need to continue to make the shift to manufactures and services and value added goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Black Jack McEwen was of the view that it was possible to sustain a raw commodities output at the same time as sustaining a manufacturing output. Unfortunately, this is not a view which the minister for primary industries subscribes to. He would have us completely at the risk of the fluctuations in commodity prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude on the National Party, it is with some consternation that I hear the almost deafening silence of National Party members from New South Wales and Queensland on the current deliberations by the government so far as the sugar industry is concerned. I raised this question with the Deputy Prime Minister last week at question time and asked when the government was proposing to announce its decision in respect of the sugar industry and the sugar tariff. We saw the following day&mdash;I clearly flushed them out&mdash;an article leaked to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of Friday, 28 February headed, `Sugar producers to get export aid for tariff reform'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The game is up so far as the sugar industry is concerned. The minister for primary industries is already talking in terms of industry adjustment rather than that which we have heard from the member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly) and the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) in raising the substantial question. The cat is out of the bag. The horse has already bolted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to raise a very serious issue in the grievance debate which is of great concern to me and to many parents in my electorate of Hughes: that is, the use of drugs by our young people. I am also alarmed at the apparent failure of the present anti&hyphen;drug use 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy, harm reduction, and wish to outline to you a superior policy of drug prevention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia presently faces an enormous crisis in that our children and young people are growing up in a culture thinking that it is normal to use drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of present government policies on drug use, the bodies and minds of our young people are being damaged, the futures of some children are being limited and some children are even dying. The responsibility for these deaths and this damage lies with us&mdash;the people who create the laws and policies of our country, the people who have made drug use, especially illicit drug use, appear to be acceptable to the young people of our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am informed that statistics from the old Department of Human Services and Health document the increasing rate of drug use amongst young Australians. Three years ago, that department published <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drug Abuse in Australia</EMPHASIS>, a document which clearly demonstrated the failure of existing anti-drug policies. Some of the findings of this document revealed that the proportion of secondary school students aged 12 to 16 years using cannabis at least weekly is increasing with every age group; that the percentage of year 11 students using marijuana increased from 30 per cent in 1989 to 43 per cent in 1992; that the<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">proportion of students who have ever used cannabis, inhalants, hallucinogens and narcotics has increased since 1986; that 40 per cent of 14&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds have tried marijuana; and that 54 per cent of males and 50 per cent of females aged between 14 and 19 years would accept an offer of marijuana. I speculate that these figures, collated in 1992 and now five years old, represent the tip of an iceberg.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Existing policies, with the lack of sound prevention initiatives in the promotion of so-called safe drug use, have clearly failed us on at least two counts: they have failed to reduce the demand for drugs and they have failed to reduce harmful use. The previous Labor government dismissed such sound drug prevention strategies. Instead, they pursued a policy that ultimately, as far as young Aus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1732"> tralians are concerned, has normalised the use of drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea adopted was that of harm reduction. This policy starts with the premise that our children will use drugs anyway; therefore, we should teach them how to use them safely. This does not impress the majority of parents. This, I believe, has increased drug use by our young people. It is now high time that we take stock of reality and change this policy for a positive focus policy that clearly targets drug prevention. Our young people are not being made aware of the health risks associated with drug use. They are also becoming increasingly confused by leaders who entertain harm reduction policies, such as the decriminalisation of cannabis or the proposed ACT heroin trials. Such actions would make harmful substances more readily available in our communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This kind of debate is disempowering parents in their desperate attempt to guide their children successfully to adulthood while at the same time tacitly telling children that it is okay to use drugs. Just last week, the New South Wales Police Commissioner suggested that we might as well try cannabis decriminalisation. Well&hyphen;regarded public figures must understand the confusion that such comments from one in such respected authority have on the mind of a child. It would be far better for the Police Commissioner to come out and say, `Let's get tough on drugs.' He could count on me to back him to the hilt, together with many other parliamentarians and thousands of worried parents. Then at least our young people would see a strong cohesive community rejection against drug use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people will experiment. It is in the nature of the young to test and to try new experiences and to push their known boundaries. However, there is a well&hyphen;established body of research which shows that, if young people think it is normal to use drugs, then increased drug use will follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conversely, as explained by Johnson et al in his research work <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drug use among American high school seniors, college students and young adults</EMPHASIS>, if children see the leaders in their community standing strongly against 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> drug use, if they are educated in the risks to their health and if they perceive the social risks of drug use, then such use will decrease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt&mdash;and many parents have complained of this to me&mdash;that there is an alarming insufficiency in the poor effort being made to inform our children of the health risks associated with drug use, because the policy of harm reduction has been established as the cornerstone of anti-drug policy in this country. I point out that research showing the success of the harm reduction policy to reduce drug use is markedly absent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, there are numerous studies demonstrating how harm reduction measures are becoming harm promotion, particularly with the young. In his paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drug Reform: the Dutch experience</EMPHASIS>, Richard Schwartz states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Dutch policy has been associated with progressive increase in cannabis among 15&hyphen;19 years old. Between 1984 and 1988, the use of cannabis increased by almost 100% amongst upper high school students in the Netherlands.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Another paper by Dr Karel Frederik Gunning, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dutch drug policy</EMPHASIS> , concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the availability and sale of cannabis in Dutch coffee shops has been associated with an increase in its social acceptability and use amongst adolescents as a soft drug.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our children deserve better than this. Our children have a right to the best protection and guidance we, their parliamentarians, police commissioners and parents alike can give them. They have a right to a superior drug policy. And I mean a policy which does not accept drug use as normal, a policy that will not give up on our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get tough on drugs. Let us deliver a smart anti&hyphen;drug policy, a positive anti-drug policy which is sustained by hope, affirmation and community leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I propose that we form a new drug policy informed by the astute research on drug prevention and drug demand reduction that is already available. Prevention is action that leads to planned change that improves life for all communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, we must maintain our efforts to reduce the supply of drugs and we definitely should not make drugs more widely available through decriminalisation and similar soft 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1733"> attitudes which send confusing messages to our young people. Secondly, we need strategies to target 100 per cent of institutions in which drug use or the promotion of drug use occurs. This includes families, schools, local communities, the mass media, the legislature, the police, the court system, treatment centres, government departments and anywhere else. Thirdly, we must foster and promote campaigns of information and prevention which bear not only on the legal aspects of drug abuse but also on the very real health risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we seriously want to change the level of drug usage in Australia, we need to think about the process of how individuals, families, communities and cultures change behaviour. Perhaps the best most recent example is the change in attitude to cigarette smoking. Many countries have been aware of the health problems associated with cigarettes since as early as the 1960s. It is now socially unacceptable to smoke in many places. Over the last 25 years, the entire population has been flooded with researched information on the health risks of smoking. The result of this prolonged effort has been the present social disapproval of smoking and a reduction in tobacco use. Drink driving is another good example of a positive and focused campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that determined drug prevention strategies work. There are countries in the world which have been extremely successful with their prevention policies. Sweden in the 1960s had a very liberal drug policy. The Swedes gave out drugs, including opiates and amphetamines, similar to the heroin trial proposed for the ACT. This resulted in a sharp increase in drug abuse in Sweden, including the use of cannabis by young children. It has taken Sweden almost 20 years to reverse that trend. Now, with the adoption of a restrictive policy and intelligent prevention strategies, Sweden has one of the lowest drug use rates in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fear that the proposed heroin trial in the ACT will undermine our present inadequate prevention efforts and send the wrong message to young people. Research on the success of such a trial is markedly absent. Research in Great Britain states that the success of heroin prescription is unproven. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The experiment with legal heroin in Switzerland has some major problems. I refer to the critique of only last year by Dr Ernst Aeschback on the scientific value of research studies accompanying heroin distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more pressing question is why are there moves to further normalise damage to our young people. Why are we not seeking solutions rather than supporting dangerous harm reduction measures? Drugs cause enormous harm to the mind, body and spirit of our young people. If we do not reverse the present trend towards so&hyphen;called responsible drug use and put in place and practise a determined prevention strategy, irreparable misery, ill health and even death will continue to threaten the happiness and fulfilment of the children of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The harm reduction experiment has been running for over a decade, and the results have shown it to be a miserable failure. Despite the alarming lack of up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date prevalence research figures, there is endless anecdotal evidence from those who work in the field that drug abuse is increasing in our young population. If we are to have the real tools to help us combat this growing problem as a nation, it is vital that prevalence studies of drug use amongst young Australians be conducted in every state on an annual basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other countries have had success in reducing drug use. These reductions have been achieved by research based prevention, parental empowerment plus clear and courageous leadership for our young on the health risks associated with these destructive substances. The wellbeing, health and happiness of our children and young people is presently under enormous threat due to this ill&hyphen;conceived unproven experiment called harm reduction. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1733"><TITLE>Dementia Counselling</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept of mainstreaming these services may be a possibility in the city, where there may be more extensive resources, but that is not the case in regional and rural New South Wales. The Orange aged care services, including representatives of the aged care assessment team, Orange City Council ageing and disabilities services and the local nursing home industry, all tell me that the national action plan for dementia has met significant gaps in service provision. They feel strongly it should be maintained indefinitely as part of ongoing aged care strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard so much about the $8 billion black hole, later $11 billion, now supplemented by $3 billion which we missed in tax receipts, and another $1&half; billion because Treasury got its sums wrong. All of this arithmetic gymnastics for what? As Bob Ellis so eloquently says, for what has this expenditure pain on the aged been imposed? In his words, `To impress four sadomonetarists in Moody's with our economic correctness'. It may come as a surprise to Treasury that carers in our community save this country not $1, $2, $3 or $5 billion but $8 billion a year. Yet we dismantle this valuable counselling service and substitute a less than satisfactory alternative arrangement through the home and community care structure whose services help carers with housework such as house cleaning, washing, ironing, shopping, transport, bathing, toileting, dressing, feeding and personal grooming&mdash;all very important, but in no way providing the very professional and targeted counselling that the dementia counselling service has delivered through these five rural officers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1735">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are aspects of the government's aged care bill exposure draft which I would also like to draw to the attention of the House. I did not receive a copy of the draft until the week before last. I could have sought a copy earlier had I known of its existence, but I chased it up in response to concerns from these aged care services in my electorate that had not seen a copy. The problem is, they were supposed to have made their comments on the draft by Friday, 21 February&mdash;the day after I received my copy. As far as I know, my copy is the only copy west of the sandstone curtain, the Blue Mountains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice the minister's office told a local paper that peak groups in aged care had had copies for some time and they should have transmitted the information down to their colleagues in the aged care industry. But the Orange district aged care assessment team, the Calare Nursing Home, the dementia counsellors, none of these had seen the draft bill and there are concerns about inclusions within that bill which they want to highlight. Such concerns relate to the accommodation bonds scheme. They wonder about clients who may have the financial resources to pay an entry contribution, but may decline placement now that the bond is a requirement for entry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aged care providers also want to know what assurances are contained in the draft bill if entry contributions will indeed be used by residential facilities for capital improvement, and they want to know whether consideration has been given to the provision of suitable residential care for people with disabilities who are not aged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken in this place in support of the thrust of the accommodation bonds proposal, particularly as it may very well maintain the viability of nursing homes in smaller communities and to enable older people to contribute to infrastructure within their own community and so stay close to relatives. But I cannot support the consultation process because it has not occurred at a grass roots level. This legislation is due to be introduced later this month, I understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some other concerns expressed to me about the aged care bill from my electorate are fears that a two&hyphen;tier system will develop, despite 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the checks and balances and accreditation requirements built into the act. It is also vital that the monitoring of access is very tightly controlled, so that the high entry contributor with low care requirements is not favoured over the low, or no entry client with high dependency. This is particularly concerning in Alzheimer's or dementia care patients. The recommendation of the aged care assessment teams should be paramount, but these teams need the assistance too of the very dementia counsellors who will be taken away from the Central West under this mainstreaming, which I see as downgrading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I want to refer to the comments of the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) earlier in this debate about Lithgow Medicare. I want to clarify a statement I made to the House last week on another health issue when I said I had received no assurance from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) that the Lithgow Medicare office would not be closing. The member for Dobell said that I had publicly repeated an assurance to this effect. A check of my records does reveal that I told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lithgow Mercury</EMPHASIS> last May that an assurance had been made to this effect by a ministerial staff member, later supported by a letter from the then parliamentary secretary, Senator Dr Bob Woods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I let the minister and the member for Dobell know about that late last week and I checked out the circumstances over the weekend. However, I accepted at the time that the assurance related to the pre&hyphen;budget concerns in the community that a closure of that office was imminent. I accept the minister's assurance now that current pharmacy trials of Medicare will be restricted to non&hyphen;Medicare agency towns and that any consideration of agency closures in larger centres will involve full and public consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remain opposed to any closure of the Lithgow Medicare office. I apologise to the member for Dobell or, indeed, the minister if I have, inadvertently, misrepresented their positions on this matter.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1735"><TITLE>Culunga Community School Aboriginal Corporation</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of this House a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1736"> matter of grave concern. This matter involves deception, alleged fraud and a complete lack of professional conduct. I refer to the Culunga Community School Aboriginal Corporation located at Harrow Street in West Swan in Western Australia.Before any of those oppose decide to shout `racist' as a response, I would like to point out that I have been made aware of this situation by concerned Aboriginal members of our community and Aboriginals associated with this school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter has received some media coverage in the past. However, the problem has note been addressed; in fact, it is worse than ever. As a background, Culunga as a school was run by the Catholic Education Authority in Western Australia until 1993. It was then vested as an Aboriginal association, pursuant to the Aboriginal Council and Associations Act 1976, As Amended. One of its many objectives&mdash;objective (c)&mdash;is: to support education, job training, health services, work and housing for its members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another objective&mdash;objective (h)&mdash;is: to receive and spend grants of money from both the Commonwealth and state governments as well as from other sources. There are other objectives. However, I am informed that the two which I have cited are not being met in a judicious manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, this school was to be supported by a democratically elected board selected from the wider community who would have as their primary interest the desire to serve the interests of the Culunga community school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time does not permit me to give a detailed account, but there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that highly respected members of the community in Western Australia, in particular Aboriginal community members, were, for want of a better word, run off and the members and friends of one particular family were elected to this board. In fact, in a letter dated 20 April 1996, the school principal wrote to Naruredine Bouhafs, the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations, in Canberra, saying, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my concern that the running of the AGM was unfair and undemocratic as the AGM was conducted in the following manner . . .  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She cites 10 points of concern. I might just refer to a couple of these points. There was some confusion as to who was chairing the AGM, and both the chairperson&mdash;it mentions a name&mdash;and a board solicitor alternated in chairing the meeting; the parents, caregivers and community members were informed that they had no voting rights although they were requested by the board, 10 days prior to the meeting, to nominate themselves to any of the positions; approximately 80 parents, caregivers and community members attended the meeting but their concerns were completely ignored, which led to feelings of frustration and anger; both the annual report and the financial report were not addressed; the agenda was not followed; and the new constitution, which solicitors and the board drafted, was not even addressed. I could go on; it is quite an extensive letter. She continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once again, I urge you to do your utmost in addressing and rectifying the present situation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was signed by the Principal of Culunga Community School. Other letters were sent to Mr Bouhafs, pleading for his help and intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Added to the maladministration and serious allegations which caused this school to become further dysfunctional was one particularly alarming incident. This incident refers to a previous chairperson of the school board endeavouring to have herself installed as the deputy principal of this school. The other members of the board, being her family and friends, agreed to this&mdash;even though they knew that she was in no way academically or otherwise qualified for the position. In other words, she just wanted to be the deputy principal without any legitimate reason for being so. Unlike the board positions, the deputy principal's position is a paid position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thankfully, after media attention and local complaints, the Western Australian Office of Non-government Education in its capacity disallowed the appointment&mdash;and, I might add, received a stinging letter in reply from the person concerned. After this and other matters were raised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> and the local community newspapers, some action was finally taken to scrutinise this school. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1737">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian Office of Non-government Education sent a superintendent to inspect the school and assess the quality of education on offer given the well documented problems that the school was having. To say the least, extracts of this report, which I have had read to me, were most critical and damning. In fact, the report reinforced all the complaints and criticisms that were made regarding this school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations, in concert with others, appointed an administrator to Culunga in 1996 with a view to addressing the now much publicised problems with Culunga. The administrator proved no more than a rubber stamp for the board that she replaced. It is little wonder because, I am informed, she is a very close relative of one or more of the board members. Given the previous nepotism of the school board and the family network associated with the school, one must question the objectivity behind the appointment of this particular administrator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Towards the end of 1996, the administrator presided over the election of a new board to replace her in 1997. And, guess what? The previous board of family and close friends and relatives was re-elected. In other words, the good old family board had been re&hyphen;elected. The net gain&mdash;almost nothing&mdash;was to legitimise the previous set of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eventually, after much scrutiny, on 3 July 1996 the federal Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, under the heading of the Australian Government Solicitor, conducted an audit relating to some of the concerns. I have a copy of the Solicitor&hyphen;General's report here and it is highly damning. It sets out, in no uncertain terms, a money trail. There is a sample of 219 payments, many of which could not be supported with appropriate documentation. These include, for example: 31 July 1994, $708; 25 November 1994, $2,900; 27 December 1994, $5,606.50. There is a whole list, which I will refer to later. It is quite damning about where the money has gone and how the school has been run. I am surprised that the matter has not received more attention so far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other items raised in the Attorney-General's audit of this school, under the support of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian Government Solicitor, include: the board members not being able to substantiate membership of the corporation; on 11 June 1996, the school staff going on strike&mdash;on 11 June 1996, a majority of staff decided to go on sick leave as a protest; and alleged intimidation of staff and former staff over a long period. In fact, people have informed me that they have been threatened with their lives, they have had their telephones cut, they have been followed home and they have been physically assaulted. An item from the Solicitor&hyphen;General's report states that police had to be called to the school over several violent acts toward students and staff, and there was a petition by parents concerning the school and a petition by many community members. There is a raft of other allegations, which I am happy to provide at the end of my contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Solicitor&hyphen;General refers to the fact that an argument may exist as to whether the corporation is acting outside of its objectives. Given that the Western Australian Office of Non-government Education sees fit to revisit the Culunga Community School as a matter of priority&mdash;they are sending a superintendent out again; given the unanswered matters highlighted in the Australian Government Solicitor's report of 3 July 1996; given the information that approximately 130 children are on the school census and there is an average daily attendance of only 45 and there is information, which I can provide, that the school attendance records are being manipulated&mdash;you will understand what I mean by the term `ghosting', I hope, as there is a Commonwealth payment which goes towards the number of children on the roll and, as I have said, these are ghosted; given that the teachers have been improperly dealt with both professionally and in terms of their employment contracts; given that there is mounting evidence to suggest that the quality of education has been severely diminished; given that the Aboriginal program in this school is almost non&hyphen;existent and has not even been implemented and that there are schools in the neighbourhood with very good Aboriginal programs; given that there are large amounts of money in the form of cheques being cashed without supporting or appropriate documenta 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1738"> tion; and given that actions have been undertaken for blatant and undeclared pecuniary interest&mdash;for these and numerous other reasons such as the availability of statutory declarations to this effect&mdash;I call on the federal minister responsible to set up an independent and responsible inquiry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1738"><TITLE>Senate Vacancy</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the House's attention to an issue which I regard as an important constitutional and democratic principle. I refer to the threat by the Queensland National Party Premier Borbidge in the last couple of days to defy the constitution and to appoint a non&hyphen;Labor person should Senator Colston be forced to resign or should there be for some other reason a casual vacancy arising from Senator Colston's departure from the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was characterised in today's front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by a banner headline saying, ` Borbidge Threat To Defy Rule on Colston'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> front page headline said, `Borbidge Ignites Colston Legal Row'. This is not just a legal row. This is not simply a rule, nor is it an important convention as it was in 1975 when a former Queensland National Party government disgraced itself and others in ignoring the conventions; it is in fact the constitution of Australia that we are talking about. There can be no more important document in the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, what we see from the comments of the National Party Premier in the last couple of days is more evidence that the white shoe spivs of the Queensland National Party are alive and well and still hold sway. They are the same people who ignore the conventions and the rules in the constitution when it suits them. They subscribe to the view: `If you've got the numbers, you don't worry about the rules.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the same people who have tried to nobble the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland and the same people who tried to nobble an inquiry into the shady deal that was done between the National Party and the police union prior to the Mundingburra by&hyphen;election. But they cannot be allowed to attack 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Australian constitution, particularly one area of the constitution which has been determined so recently in historical terms by the people of Australia. I think it is important to put on the record the exact reference from the constitution. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a vacancy has at any time occurred in the place of a senator chosen by the people of a State and, at the time when he was so chosen, he was publicly recognized by a particular political party as being an endorsed candidate of that party and publicly represented himself to be such a candidate, a person chosen or appointed under this section in consequence of that vacancy, or in consequence of the vacancy and a subsequent vacancy or vacancies, shall, unless there is no member of that party available to be chosen or appointed, be a member of that party.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The wording of the constitution and the amendment adopted by the people by referendum in 1977 made it clear that it was a senator chosen by the people at the time in which he was chosen to be member of a political party. For the National Party spivs to hop up now and publicly claim that they have some legal advice that allows them to try to subvert that process is an affront to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course a lot of the debate and the amendments to the constitution that I just referred to came from the events of 1975, and Senator Colston had something of a role in the drama of 1975. In 1977 when the constitutional amendments were so strongly passed&mdash;and that  question was passed in every state of Australia, by the way, and in the state of Queensland it was passed with a majority of greater than 58 per cent&mdash;Senator Colston was moved to support the referendum&mdash;not surprisingly, given his role in the 1975 issues. He put out a press release on Tuesday 17 May in 1977 in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland Labor Senator Mal Colston has challenged the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen, to a public debate on the casual vacancies referendum.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And that would have been a clash of the intellectual giants, no doubt. The press release went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Colston strongly advocates a "Yes" vote for the casual vacancy proposals and the other three referendum questions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Elsewhere he said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1739">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is imperative that the composition of the Senate as determined by the voters is not upset by arbitrary underhand methods such as Mr Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen used in 1975.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, Senator Colston was dead right when he said that in 1977. He was quite right to point that out. This was not something that the Labor Party was the sole voice on. I happily acknowledge that there are a number of people in the Liberal Party who in 1975 and again in 1977 took what I regard as the proper, principled, democratic position in that debate. In fact, when Mal Colston lost the opportunity to go into the Senate in 1975 the newspapers of the day reported it in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The official A.L.P. candidate, Dr Mal Colston, lost 53 to 26 although every Liberal Cabinet minister present at the debate voted with the A.L.P., including the Liberal leader and Deputy Premier, Sir Gordon Chalk.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Liberal Party in 1975 understood those principles and, quite rightly, was critical of the spivs in the National Party for their antics in 1975. It is a sad reflection that in 1997, 20 years down the track, we have the same spivs in the National Party trying to pull the same stunts. Sadly, we have not had the same strength of commitment from the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to refer to one other comment from the Liberal Party of the day because it comes from a gentleman whom I respect. In 1975 during what was very much the heat of the issue, the shadow defence spokesman, the then Mr D.J. Killen, made a number of comments about it. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He disagreed with State Parliaments filling casual vacancies "without proper regard to the character of political associations."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I am dead against it, and I do not intend to change," he said. "It is one of the most significant de facto alterations ever to the Australian Constitution."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Jim Killen was right when he said that, and it is about time we saw from the Liberals of the 1997 era the same sort of commitment to&mdash;and conviction about&mdash;these basic principles. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today in question time the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was asked a question about these matters and he gave an answer that I thought was so tepid. He said&mdash;what else could he say?&mdash;referring to the vacancies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . those should be filled in accordance with both the letter and the spirit of the constitution as amended by referendum of the Australian people in 1977.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course they should! And, as the Prime Minister and head of government of this nation, what is it that he has done or intends to do about it? There has only been one occasion since 1977 where this principle has been tested, and that was in 1987. These things seem to come in cycles of a decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1987, when then Senator Don Grimes retired, the Tasmanian conservative government decided they would play games with his replacement. The Tasmanian Premier of the day, Mr Gray, declined to accept the recommendation or the nominee of the Labor Party to fill that vacancy, even though the constitution clearly required it. The ALP's nominee at that time was Mr Devereux. On that occasion Mr Howard had a little more intestinal fortitude to deal with the circumstance confronting him because on that occasion, in 1987, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advocate</EMPHASIS> newspaper records Mr Howard in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liberal leader John Howard yesterday delivered a mammoth blow to Premier Robin Gray's attempts to reject ALP nominee John Devereux as Tasmania's next senator by telling Mr Gray to back down.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what he said to Robin Gray in 1987 when Robin Gray tried to pull the same stunt. But here we are 10 years after this, when he is the Prime Minister of the country, and the best he can do is come in here at question time with a tepid answer. But that is better than we got yesterday because yesterday, if you have a look at the AAP wire as at last night, on this issue the AAP wire recorded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard's office would not comment on the constitutional issues raised by Mr Borbidge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Last night he could not move himself to make any comment at all. At least in 1987 he had the decency to get on the phone and ring up Robin Gray and say, `You cannot do this, it is not on.' In 1997 he should do the same thing. As the Prime Minister of Australia, he 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1740"> should be on the phone to the spivs in the National Party in Queensland and he should be making it plain to them that the constitution is not a toy for them. They can play games in their backroom&mdash;in the bunker at Spring Hill or wherever their new party office is going to be&mdash;they can play those games the way the former National Party Premier, Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen, used to do in their own backyard if they must, but they are not going to play games with the Australian constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time that the Prime Minister made that plain. He should do it immediately and he should do it publicly. The Queensland National Party Premier deserves to be rebuked by the head of the government of this country for calling into doubt the constitution of Australia and for threatening a very clear expression of the will of the Australian people passed in every state of the country only 20 years ago.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1740"><TITLE>Aged Care</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This grievance debate has come at a most opportune time for me, as in my electorate of Capricornia in central Queensland we have an ever&hyphen;increasing problem with the lack of aged care facilities. We have a need, not a want. It has become a point of desperation for the public health facilities, community aided nursing care groups, families or carers and, of course, the aged people themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is less expensive for the taxpayers to care for the elderly in dedicated nursing homes than have them tie up beds in the hospital system, which is the present case. The situation has been like this for years, and I intend over the following months to provide sufficient evidence to prove my case for the need for nursing care. The statement by the bureaucracy that we have more than enough beds is misleading and nothing but a furphy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To this end I wish to announce that I will be employing a research officer in my electorate of Capricornia. It should be noted, of course, that some of the cost of the submission will be at my own expense. With this in mind, although we may feel passionately about a particular issue, I firmly believe and reinforce that we are not in this parliament for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> our own benefit but to serve our employers, the people in our electorates&mdash;or, more to the point for me, the people of Capricornia. The research officer's responsibilities will be to prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that Capricornia is lacking the bed numbers and facilities required to give a responsible standard of care. To ensure the result is not biased and has no holes in it, the officer will be an individual of sufficient ability to handle the task set and be 100 per cent au fait with the position which the electorate is currently in and will have the ability to get past the bureaucratic brick walls presently erected throughout this country. In other words, the officer and their completed submission will have the teeth to do the required job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This untenable situation facing us today is only getting worse, on the ground I can prove that the more mature electors of Australia are moving north in their later years of life, particularly those not from Queensland. One of the major reasons for this, of course, is that in Queensland we do not have a death duty like in some other states. I believe that the care of the aged is paramount, because they have paid their dues to society and, fair's fair, it is time we gave them back so much of what they deserve, and that is our care in their later years of life. I must say it is not much to ask, particularly after what they have done for us. On top of this, it will create jobs for the people in Capricornia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point it is imperative that I give some examples of what we are currently experiencing in Capricornia. For example, a situation was brought to my attention which highlights the need for additional bed spaces. A married couple aged 94 and 92 were living in a retirement village in Yeppoon. They have no family close to them. In fact, their closest relatives are nieces and nephews who live in mining towns in central Queensland. The wife became very ill and was transferred to St Andrew's Private Hospital in Rockhampton. She remained there for 30 days, only to be moved when the bed was required. Yeppoon Base Hospital initially did not have a bed for her as they were already beyond their normal capacity to care for the aged.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1741">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because patients had nowhere to go at that particular time, all it did was cause overstraining because of bed capacity, and, like I said, they lacked nursing care. Eventually, a placement was found in a nursing home in Longreach. This was not suitable as it would mean that she would have to leave her husband for good. Because of their separation, and because of their age, they would not have the ability to visit each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To cut a long story short, they had to find somewhere to go to be together. In the end, a nursing home was found in Cairns&mdash;quite a long way from Yeppoon, I must remind everybody. But, at that point, they had nowhere else to go. So at least they have somewhere at this particular stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to bring to the attention of the House an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Central Queensland News</EMPHASIS> on Wednesday, 12 February. It was the story of a man, Mr Clive Callaghan, who was torn from his family and friends to be placed in a home more than 400 kilometres away from those he loved and cherished so much, only to die three weeks later. He was a broken&hyphen;hearted man, all because a bed was not available in his town of Emerald.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasing pressure being applied on nursing home providers indicates that the current level of licences is inadequate. Pressure is coming from three directions. Firstly, there is pressure from people who have been assessed as requiring nursing home care but who are forced to remain in the community. Secondly, there is the pressure from people in hospital wards requiring care but who cannot be placed. Thirdly, there are a growing number of residents in hostels who require nursing home care but who also cannot be placed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the year 2001 it is anticipated there will be some 429,000 Queenslanders aged 65 and over and 44,800 aged 85 and over. For Rockhampton and the central highlands, the aged care places based on the national service provision benchmark are considered comparatively high. I am told that this national benchmark is not an indication of need but, within available resources, sets the level of funding provided in any one locality.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this basis, we are told that the provision of additional places in the region would not be considered a high priority. How can this be when we have waiting lists in the hospitals and nursing homes? At present, in Rockhampton and Central Queensland, nursing homes are full, with lengthy waiting lists. The position with hostels is little better. This is now impacting on community support services in a number of ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the government on its reforms to aged care which will address the concerns in the future. However, we have a crisis now. Recently in Rockhampton the state government, with federal funding, announced the redevelopment of the Eventide Nursing Home to the tune of $9.5 million. The Eventide Nursing Home is a 130&hyphen;bed facility. The new redevelopment is an 80&hyphen;bed facility. Rockhampton has just lost 50 beds to the system. In other words, instead of reducing the problem, it has created problems.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1742"> as the world has changed quite massively over the course of this century since the Audit Act was initially passed in 1901, so too have the needs concerning financial management, accountability and auditing in the Commonwealth sector. What this legislation seeks to do is to modernise, streamline and improve the existing financial management framework. It represents quite a substantial milestone in the financial management of the Commonwealth and it is legislation which is supported by the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from its intrinsic merits, the package of bills is supported, I have to say, because it was an initiative of the former Labor government. I have to say, with all due churlishness, that it is no credit to this government that it delayed the passage of these bills during the last parliament and has waited more than a year since being elected to have them now debated in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of members would be aware of the rather tortuous history of this legislative package, but I think I should, at least briefly, put on record the origins of these bills. It really goes back to 1988 and 1989 when the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, in its report No. 296 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: ally of the people and parliament</EMPHASIS>, suggested a major reform of the Audit Act. The Labor government responded to that report in November 1989, accepting this basic recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The complex policy development and drafting process was completed and legislation was finally introduced into the House&mdash;not quickly, I have to acknowledge&mdash;in 1994. It was then considered in detail by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which issued its advisory report No. 331 in September of that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, it was not possible to get agreement in the parliament on the final design of the package because of some, I have to say, opportunistic behaviour by the then opposition in the Senate. As a result, the legislation lapsed when the parliament was prorogued before the last election. It is to this opportunistic behaviour that my second reading amendment, which I will move at the conclusion of this, is directed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) wrote to the new chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), on 12 August 1996 requesting that the JCPA consider how the functional independence of the Auditor-General could be improved in the context of the government finalising the details of this package of legislation. That resulted in its report No. 346 of October last year and the introduction of these bills following that, on 12 December last.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising, now that we look at the terms of this legislation, but it is a little bit disappointing, for those of us who appreciate a degree of consistency when we see it, that the current government has changed many of the positions that it rigorously argued when our legislation was being debated during the last parliament. I say disappointing not from the point of view of outcomes, because we think the outcomes are far better to be couched in the way they are now, but it is always a bit interesting to see the wisdom of views that were hotly contested at the time now being accepted once the transition to government has been made. It would have been nice to have had some acknowledgment of the change of heart and the reasons for it, which we have not seen. I will come back to some of this later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of what this legislation is all about, there are two basic differing categories of entity within the Commonwealth sector. Either a body has the legal capacity in its own right to acquire ownership of assets, including money, or it may function only as a financial and custodial agent for the legal entity of the Commonwealth as a whole. Which category a body falls into is dependent upon the kind of legislation or other process which establishes it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two of the four bills in this legislative package consolidate the regulatory, accounting, accountability framework of these two basic categories into separate bills. The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill applies to those entities in the first category I mentioned&mdash;namely, those bodies with a capacity in their own right to acquire ownership of assets&mdash;while the Financial Management and Accountability Bill applies 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1743"> to the second category, where bodies function only as agents of the Commonwealth. These two bills will certainly provide a modern and appropriate framework which specifies the responsibilities and powers necessary for the efficient, effective and ethical use of the resources available to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as financial management and accountability is concerned, this maintains the central role of the finance minister in the functioning of the so-called constitutional Treasury of the Commonwealth. The minister retains the sole power to agree appropriate banking arrangements for public money and its investment. The current legislation is silent on the issue of management performance. The new FMA legislation seeks to place responsibilities, however, specifically on chief executives of agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CEOs are to be required to manage their agencies efficiently, effectively and ethically. They will be required to implement fraud control plans and to establish audit committees. The Minister for Finance will also be able to request financial information more regularly than annually from agencies to ensure better supervisory standards. Chief executives are to be permitted to subdelegate to officials. This is designed to achieve a major strengthening of the financial framework. The rationale behind this is that they are better placed than the finance minister to manage the specific tasks. The bill is virtually indistinguishable from the one proposed by us. It would be extremely cantankerous of us, under those circumstances, to oppose it. We do not; we support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill achieves a number of things. The Commonwealth authorities and companies have been generally regulated by part 11 of the parent Audit Act. Since this is to be repealed, replacement provisions are needed and now there is a whole bill specifically devoted to this task. While most authorities are regulated under the Audit Act only about two-thirds of them are currently caught under the general legislation with the rest having their own financial reporting and auditing provisions. That is the situation at the moment. Similarly, the memoranda and articles 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of association of many Commonwealth companies contain their own requirements so far as accountability to ministers is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the new bill does is propose to replace these very diverse accountability requirements with a single set of core requirements. Many of these are modelled on comparable areas of the Corporations Law as well as best practice applying to individual authorities. This standardisation is a major reform which should both strengthen and simplify the current regulatory requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, this bill is virtually indistinguishable from the one proposed by Labor and we are certainly not opposed to it. The major change seems to be the strengthening of the penalties applicable to office holders of Commonwealth authorities and/or companies to include a civil penalty regime in addition to a criminal penalty regime. We support this initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While each of the four pieces in the legislative package is significant, the Auditor-General Bill is the key element of the whole package. The mere existence of a separate Auditor-General Bill is a recognition of the almost unique position of the Auditor-General in the constitutional institutional arrangements of this nation. I say almost unique because, as my colleague the member for Chifley (Mr Price) continues to remind me, the ombudsman is in a very similar position&mdash;though not being given appropriate recognition by this government at least so far as making available to her the necessary resources for her to do her job properly are concerned. Let me say that the special position, rather than the unique position, arises because of the special duties of the Auditor-General, the special responsibilities of that office and the really quite fundamental importance to effective and accountable democracy that a fearless and truly independent watchdog does provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subclause 8(1) of the bill proposes to designate the Auditor-General as an independent officer of the parliament. We have no problem with this approach. Indeed, we do think it is appropriate to recognise the uniqueness or special character of the position. I think we do have to frankly acknowledge that this change is really cosmetic and meaningless as it is brought to fruition in the terms of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1744"> this particular legislation. Subclause 8(2) really makes this crystal clear when you look at its terms. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no implied functions, powers, rights, immunities or obligations arising from the Auditor-General being an independent officer of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I should add that there are no explicit or express functions, powers, rights, immunities or obligations either. The bill is really quite silent in all these things. So in terms of the functions of the office, it really is quite meaningless to describe the Auditor&hyphen;General as an officer of the parliament. It is mere window dressing without any substance&mdash;like a few other policies of this government; for example, the ministerial code of conduct springs rapidly to mind. So it is not unique in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority is a somewhat more substantial step toward ensuring the actual independence of the Auditor-General. Currently the ANAO exists as an administratively established body only. It is therefore technically very much at the mercy of the executive of the day. It could be abolished at any time. With the passage of this legislation, that unsatisfactory state of affairs will have been ended and the ANAO will, to that extent, have the protection of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very important that the Auditor-General and the administrative machinery surrounding him and the particular core functions that he exercises do have the protection of the parliament and also the commitment of the executive government of the day. The current circumstances that are unfolding in Victoria do, I think, give us an object lesson of what not to do in this respect. Many members will be aware of the quite outrageous proposals now being examined by the Kennett government concerning the state Auditor-General's role in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Ches Baragwanath has been a high profile watchdog of the Victorian government since the early 1990s. In the conduct of his duties I have to say he has exposed financial mismanagement and maladministration not only by the current government but also, to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some extent, by the former ALP government. While it is always embarrassing for any government to have administrative failings exposed in this respect, it is perfectly proper that they be exposed provided, of course, the officer in question is acting in a level&hyphen;headed, meticulous and non&hyphen;crusading or emotionally excessive, overextended kind of way. All of that is the task of an Auditor-General&mdash;to look at just these questions of basic financial administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role does need a fearless, competent person who is prepared to incur the wrath of the government of the day to provide proper protection for taxpayers. Just one example of the unhappy situation in Victoria these days, out of a legion that come to mind, is the Crown Casino saga. One particular aspect of this was an additional licence being granted to Crown for a further 150 gaming tables for consideration of $85 million. Mr Baragwanath pointed out in his report on ministerial portfolios of May 1996 that the government could have actually charged up to $259 million for the additional licence. The Kennett government had in effect given Crown Casino a windfall of $174 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of this and a good many other adverse findings against the present Victorian government&mdash;including the misuse of government advertising for political purposes&mdash;Mr Kennett wanted to bring the Auditor-General there down a peg or two. First he tried to put him onto a completely inappropriate contract, which Mr Baragwanath successfully resisted. Now we are seeing unfold a totally mischievous misuse of the so-called obligations of the government under the national competition policy to try to remove the Auditor-General's monopoly over external auditing in the Victorian public sector. That exercise has led to the unprecedented warning we have seen in recent days from the Australasian Council of Auditors&hyphen;General that the Victorian government's agenda of open competition and letting it all go off to the private sector will interfere with the independence of the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our understanding that no other jurisdiction in this country, either the Commonwealth or any of the states or territories, is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1745"> looking at its audit legislation in the same way as Victoria, even though all of them do have an obligation to undertake competition policy related reviews. In the Commonwealth and in a number of other states as well, the Auditor-General is expressly permitted to subcontract out some of the actual functions of the auditing task, but the responsibility to certify, to report, at the end of the day as to the affairs of particular departments and agencies remains that of the Auditor-General himself. The statutory obligation is not diminished in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what is up for grabs in Victoria and it is a pretty obvious, transparent endeavour to&mdash;as Mr Baragwanath has been saying very publicly&mdash;`effectively muzzle' parliament's watchdog or at least put it on `an extremely short leash'. He has gone on to predict the potential for `irreparable long-term damage' to the governance of Victoria's public sector if the changes go ahead. Hopefully the provisions that we are putting in place with the passage of this legislation at the Commonwealth level will make impossible that kind of exercise of crude executive political muscle here at the Commonwealth level. I certainly hope so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, the bill does contain a number of examples where there is some pretty breathtaking hypocrisy being displayed by the government. I think I will get out of the habit of talking about `breathtaking' hypocrisy because just about every example of hypocrisy that one comes across these days is in fact quite breathtaking, and it has become almost an unnecessary cliche to talk of it in those terms. This is hypocrisy with a capital H, but that is not unusual because we have seen a lot of examples of this. I am talking about a number of issues which we were told were so vital to the coalition before the last election that they simply could not allow the then tabled legislation to proceed without amendment&mdash;issues on which they have now been utterly exposed as hypocritical opportunists because they have now altered or completely reversed their previous positions. Now they are in government and seeing things from the perspective of government, they are basically adopting positions which were the sensible ones to adopt all along.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give some examples of this phenomenon at work. First of all, the Senate actually went so far as to amend the Labor legislation to ensure that the Auditor-General could not be appointed unless at least two-thirds of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts agreed with the appointment. The government's bill proposes only that a simple majority should be necessary to agree to the appointment of the Auditor-General. Obviously the change to a simple majority vote keeps the power with the executive&mdash;something which we are familiar with. Here it is, and let's recognise perhaps the acceptability of that&mdash;I am not arguing against that&mdash;but let's at least acknowledge that nothing really has changed so far as the basic principles are involved, only the names of the players.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the Senate also amended the Labor legislation to allow for consultation between the Auditor-General and the chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts where the Auditor-General wishes to suppress the disclosure of sensitive information. Clause 37 of the bill currently proposes that the Auditor-General should not be allowed to disclose information if he or she is of the opinion that disclosure would be contrary to the public interest or if the Attorney-General has issued a certificate to suppress the disclosure of information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say here is that, if Labor had proposed this type of secrecy regime, this would have been vigorously denounced by members of the coalition. Now they are running mute on the issue; they are proposing an absolute blanket of secrecy from an officer of the parliament to any member of parliament. This is one provision about which we do have some concerns. We certainly would have preferred the original terms of our legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next we come to the exercise whereby the coalition members were very keen to ensure that the Auditor-General was able to conduct performance audits on government business enterprises or any of their subsidiaries and amended, again, the 1994 bill in the Senate to that effect except for partially privatised GBEs. The current bill basically adopts Labor's model, which involves a request from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1746"> either the Minister for Finance or the joint committee before a performance audit of a government business enterprise can be undertaken. We agree with that proposal, but we are unimpressed, again, with the hypocrisy of the now government in opportunistically changing its views for no other reason than its change of status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in this respect let me mention a similar disdain for consistency that was displayed in the government's preferred provisions concerning the appointment of the Auditor-General. The government has changed its previous position on the appointment, now preferring a bare majority in votes on the joint committee rather than the two&hyphen;thirds majority that had been previously insisted on by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last bill in this package of four contains the myriad of consequential and transitional provisions which arise from a rewrite of the Audit Act. The major initiatives here are provisions which increase the role of the joint committee. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts is now to become the Audit Committee of the parliament. The joint committee's additional responsibilities wearing this new title will include consideration and reporting on the operations and resources of the ANAO, examination of the draft budget of the ANAO, subsequent reporting of recommendations to the finance minister and both houses of parliament, determining the audit priorities of the parliament and advising the Auditor-General of those priorities. Labor supports all these proposals. We have no difficulty with any of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has provided the opposition with some notice of two amendments which it proposes to move. Let me say that we have no problem with either of them. We will be supporting them. There is no need to delay the House in the consideration in detail stage for that reason. The first is a minor technical error on the timing of the commencement of the Natural Heritage Trust. The second, however, is really much more significant and deserves a little attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an error in the bill&mdash;a rather spectacular one&mdash;which would have been serious if it had not been detected and gone 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through unamended. That is fixed in the new clause 1056B, which is amended to ensure that the Treasurer retains his existing power to approve of amounts of Reserve Bank profits being set aside for contingencies. Without this amendment I understand the distribution of the Reserve Bank's income could have been inappropriately high and inadequate moneys might have been retained by the bank for future contingencies. Perhaps this error was picked up by the same very astute Reserve Bank officer who was the one who apparently noticed that Mr Costello's, the Treasurer's, mid-year review estimates of the general government sector underlying deficit was actually $1.2 billion greater than that originally published in January.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me to make an observation about the number of really quite significant errors that have been creeping into Commonwealth financial administration and in fact becoming a matter of now public notoriety and, I would have hoped, some concern to the government, not that there is much sign of it, given the normal insouciance with which these matters are being brushed aside by the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance. Let me mention for a start, after all the trumpeting about the Labor government's forecasting difficulties at a time of low inflation in our last budget, we have seen announced in the mid-year review a blow-out within six months of this government's budget of just on $3 billion&mdash;the Costello crater or chasm as it is appropriately called&mdash;itself a product of misforecasting of inflation, messed up wage growth forecasts and also very comprehensive misreading of the likely collections from company tax following earlier changes to the company tax rate, which threw the budget out by some $1.6 billion in the space of the time I have mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reports have now been coming in incidentally about the government being aware of that forecasting error as early as September last year. I note again in passing the ministerial code of conduct seems to have no application to some people in the government when it comes to correcting things in the public domain at the first available opportunity. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1747">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, we had the mid-year review document itself becoming subject to a further confession of error. Indeed, it was a confession of error on a spectacular scale with a further $1.2 billion of blow&hyphen;out coming to light, this time in the bottom line of the so-called general government deficit, raising a very real question&mdash;although, again, it was brushed aside by the Treasurer in this House&mdash;as to whether the budget sector would in fact have to pick up the tab for the blow&hyphen;out, if not this financial year then next year, whether caused by revenue shortfalls, expenditure overruns, or whatever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point, as I have publicly, that errors of this kind do subject us, among other things, to a degree of international ridicule, given that the OECD and other international agencies do pay particular regard to these figures, not least the figure of general government deficit, which is something separate and distinct from the budget deficit itself but, nonetheless, it is an important macro-economic accounting entity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point about the mid-year review errors is that there was not just one big error of that kind. There were in fact something like 170 separate arithmetical or numerical errors in the mid-year review document&mdash;leading me to make the point on one or two occasions that, while one clerical error may be regarded as a misfortune, to have 170 begins to look more than a little like carelessness.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The auditing of the executive government in this respect would be very sensible, as the member for Chifley says. The government's credibility in all of this has also been diminished because of the way in which it tried to conceal public information about the scale of these particular errors. The correction document was not given to the press, was not circulated, was not passed around Parliament House and was not tabled in parliament; it was just hoped that somehow, by printing it and giving it in due course to a handful of people who had to have it, the scale of the mess&hyphen;up would pass unnoticed. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth asking why so many of these errors have been creeping into public administration. The ministers have to accept the immediate responsibility for them; whether they do so or not may be another matter. But lying behind that is the question which is concerning many people now&mdash;that the impact of significant downsizing and the loss of expertise in key areas of the Commonwealth Public Service will now create a much greater chance than used to be the case of significant errors of this kind recurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The newly elected member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel) raised our concern about this in this place on 27 February when he asked a question of the Minister for Finance. He asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . whether it was the savage staff cuts in his department which led to the spectacular blunders in the mid&hyphen;year review? Is it true that the Department . . . is to be savagely reduced again in this year's budget?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That followed reports that had appeared in the public print to that effect. He further asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it true that the minister is planning to cut staff by four to five per cent this year and four to five per cent the year after?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He then asked whether it was true that the ultimate object, as reported, was to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . reduce Finance to a rump of 60 staff, with the loss of corporate memory, skills and staff numbers?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The rest of the functions would presumably be farmed out somewhere else. We did not get any sort of an answer from the Minister for Finance. He just said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The answer to all four questions . . . is no.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whether that was because it was only a 3.9 per cent reduction contemplated rather than a four to five per cent reduction, or whether it was 65 staff contemplated as the end rump rather than 60, we do not know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we do know is that there does appear to be a continuing pressure on all government departments and agencies to reduce their personnel. That has also been the case with the major financial and management administering departments of state, Finance in particular. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been reported in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as saying that more spending cuts are necessary following the deterioration in the government's tax takings&mdash;to which I have already adverted. So the pressure will in fact continue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1748">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other reasons why we say that the budgetary contractionary exercise is misconceived. This is not the time to be going into them now, but certainly it is the case that one of the consequences of this kind of budgetary pressure is to make it more and more probable, more and more likely, more and more certain that errors on this scale will continue to recur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say simply in conclusion&mdash;having made all those points about the bill itself and about some of the issues arising out of aspects of it&mdash;that this is important legislation. It will be given swift passage by the opposition, and not before time after the number of years it has been hanging around. The comprehensiveness and flexibility of the new provision should provide a very good framework for Commonwealth financial management&mdash;provided there is the staff there to administer it&mdash;well into the next century. The legislation should have been a lot higher on the government's priority list than being relegated to something that could not be advanced within a year of election but, that said, it is better late than never.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These four bills incorporate most of the recommendations made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the JCPA, in two of its reports: report 313 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An advisory report on the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994, Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994 and the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1994 and on a proposal to establish an audit committee of parliament</EMPHASIS> tabled in September 1994; and report 346 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guarding the independence of the Auditor-General</EMPHASIS> tabled in December 1996. The financial management and accountability legislation package is of paramount importance to the future of federal government and of the parliament itself. The existence of a strong and independent Auditor-General is absolutely fundamental to the effectiveness of the parliament in its scrutiny of executive government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In report 331, the JCPA, of which I was deputy chairman at the time, made a series of recommendations to amend the Auditor-General Bill 1994 to enhance the functional independence of the Auditor-General from the executive and to provide for greater parliamentary involvement in the performance of the audit function. In report 346, the JCPA recommended that the Auditor-General be declared in the redrafted Auditor-General Bill an `independent officer of the parliament'. It is satisfying to the JCPA to know that its recommendation has been adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The title independent officer of the parliament encapsulates the role and status of the office of the Auditor-General. The Auditor- 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1749"> General performs a function that is essential to parliamentary scrutiny but which the parliament itself has neither the technical expertise nor the resources to perform. The Auditor-General does the work of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA recommended in report 346 that a guarantee of the Auditor-General's audit independence be enshrined in the Auditor-General Bill, putting beyond doubt that the Auditor-General has complete discretion in determining the audit program of the Australian National Audit Office and in deciding the manner in which audits will be conducted. We are delighted that the government has in the 1996 bill made the Auditor-General an independent officer of the parliament, but not subject to direction from the parliament in relation to the exercise of audit functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> An important element of the new framework to underpin the independence of the Auditor-General is the establishment of an audit committee of parliament which, on behalf of the parliament, will enhance the transparency of decisions taken in relation to the Auditor-General. It is most appropriate that the JCPA will be empowered to perform the duties of an audit committee of parliament, with an increase in committee membership from 15 to 16. The audit committee functions are an integral part of the JCPA's existing broad role of reporting to the parliament on means for improving public accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA is enthusiastic about the prospect of becoming the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, the JCPAA, of the parliament. The bill provides to the newly expanded JCPA the powers of veto over executive appointments to the position of Auditor-General. This requires a majority vote within the JCPA and will ensure that any appointment will be subject to committee scrutiny. The JCPA has also noted that the new JCPAA has similar powers of approval over the appointment of the Independent Auditor and may advise the Independent Auditor of parliament's audit priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In report 346, the committee had recommended that the Auditor-General Bill provide for the Auditor-General to have a mandate to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conduct a full range of financial and performance audits across the entire public sector, including performance audits in government business enterprises. While the Auditor&hyphen;General is so empowered, the mandate is not unfettered. It is very satisfying to the JCPA to know that the government has accepted all bar two of its recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to turn my attention to the issue of sensitive audit information. The Auditor-General Bill makes the Attorney-General the arbitrator in deciding when sensitive information may not be disclosed. However, the bill does not restrict the circumstances in which an Attorney-General can order the Auditor-General to suppress the publication of sensitive information. The JCPA had recommended in its report that suppression orders would apply only where the publication of the information was likely to prejudice national security interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA is also concerned that in those circumstances where a suppression order is issued by an Attorney-General the Auditor-General Bill forbids the Auditor-General providing an unabridged copy of the audit report and/or a copy of the suppressed information to any parliamentarian, the JCPAA or either house of parliament. The only recipient of the information will be the relevant minister, the Minister for Finance and the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee feels that this is not transparent, that it is not enhancing the independence of the Auditor-General and that it is not enabling the parliament to properly scrutinise. The JCPA believes that this clause of the bill will have the effect of limiting the powers of parliament. For parliament not to have access to some of the information which might be excluded by this clause impinges on the rights of Australians to have the administration of the country by the executive properly scrutinised by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA considers the independence of the Auditor-General to be absolutely fundamental to public accountability in Australia. If the Auditor-General is not properly resourced or does not have a legislative mandate to carry out an effective and broad scrutiny of the public sector, then parliament 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1750"> itself is compromised in its ability to hold the executive to account. In adopting most of the recommendations of the JCPA in report 346, the government has gone a long way to restoring authority and meaning to the parliament and securing the Auditor-General's independence from the executive. We find it a shame that the clause on sensitive audit information compromises this independence to a degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the other three bills which make up the FMA legislation package. All the recommendations made by the JCPA in its report 331, except one, have been accepted by the government in its 1996 CAC Bill and the 1996 FMA Bill. The one exception concerns the penalty regime for breaches of trust and duty by directors of Commonwealth authorities and companies. The penalty regime will be consistent with that which applies to directors of private companies rather than the more stringent criminal penalty regime proposed by the 1994 version of the bill and supported by the JCPA. The JCPA accepts this modification as it realises that it may be unduly harsh for directors of Commonwealth authorities and companies to be subjected to criminal penalties were they to breach trust and duty when private sector directors are treated more leniently for similar breaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the committee acknowledges that the four bills reflect the spirit of the committee's reports. The JCPA is pleased that changes to the Audit Act 1901 are finally being made. It believes that the 1996 bills will result in greater transparency and accountability among public agencies. By heeding recommendations in reports 331 and 346, the government has ensured that Australia is at the forefront of international trends to greater financial accountability reporting for governments. It is encouraging for the JCPA and the whole parliament to see so many of its recommendations incorporated in these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I close, when we see reforms such as these tabled in parliament and presented by ministers of successive governments over a long period of time, we should be aware that this does not happen overnight. These bills are here after a long process of policy devel 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opment involving many people of vision working behind the scenes. I believe parliament should express its thanks to these people and always give credit where credit is due.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I wish to place on record my personal thanks, as well as that of the JCPA, to Mr Maurie Kennedy&mdash;who is with us tonight in the advisers' gallery&mdash;the Assistant Secretary to the Financial Administration Advisory Branch. Mr Kennedy and his team have been the driving force behind the conceptual development of the new FMA legislation, gathering together a skilled and experienced team to undertake the work. He has displayed qualities of strong and sound leadership, absolute professionalism and real determination to see this package of bills and this project through to fruition. I am sure that Maurie is as pleased as the JCPA is to see these bills back in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the bills finally become law, Australia will have a legislative model that ensures the retention of important protections for the public purse while enabling more flexible, innovative and responsive management practices by Commonwealth agencies. The new legislation sets a professional standard for probity and ethical behaviour in the provision of government services and the accountability of bureaucracy to parliament. Mr Kennedy deserves much of the credit for this achievement. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment moved by my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). In so doing, I want to say that I think&mdash;as all members of the House will&mdash;this is a welcome package. We have some debate, as is reflected in the amendment, about elements of it. I detected some of those concerns in the comments of the Chairman of the JCPA reflecting that committee's views. I respect the manner in which they were presented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Chairman of the JCPA said, it is a package with a long gestation period. One could have expected a much larger package, given the length of the gestation period. Elephants have been bred in much shorter periods. Nevertheless, that has allowed a lot 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1751"> of sensible discussion and debate. It has also allowed for an unfortunate amount of hyperbole, exaggeration and claiming of the moral high ground. Nevertheless, it is a package on which a lot of work has been done by a lot of very good officers of the Public Service, a lot of members of parliament, staff of this parliament and independent commentators over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want, particularly, to refer tonight to the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill. I will make some brief comments on the other elements of the package but they are not the ones to which I wish to give my attention; nor are they the ones to which the amendment refers. The package is very well known and understood by members. In brief, it is a package of bills which will replace the Audit Act 1901, which regulates the financial management of the Commonwealth sector. It is a significant reform, initiated by the previous Labor government. It seeks to modernise, streamline and standardise the financial management and auditing regime which applies to all Commonwealth entities. In particular, with regard to the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill, it sets out the Auditor&hyphen;General's powers and functions, and specifies, clarifies and broadens those when compared with the current arrangements, which have their origin in the act of 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many changes, however. I suppose the most important symbolic change is that the Auditor&hyphen;General is specifically designated as an officer of the parliament. I do not want to go on about the detail, merely reiterating things which have been said by others or which are adequately written elsewhere. But it is fact that the function of an Auditor&hyphen;General, and particularly of an independent Auditor&hyphen;General, is and should be a very important function of any Westminster system of parliament. The function of audit of public finance and public instrumentalities and of ensuring the proper use of taxpayers' money is not an issue of concern exclusively, of course, to Westminster systems. But the particular nature of an Auditor&hyphen;General and its relationship to the parliament does have its Westminster elements. Here in Australia, as in other comparable jurisdictions, it has always been an important part of our financial 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arrangements. It has always been one of those elements which should be and, when properly recognised and explained, has the capacity to be a source of assurance to Australians that their taxes are being spent as intended by the parliament and that they are being spent scrupulously, honestly and fairly. It also has the potential to play other, more positive roles in terms of allowing more innovative management processes without the risk of misuse of public funds because of the rigour of audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make some brief comments on the comparison between the major bills and the package of 1994, not at great length but to some extent because it is relevant to the amendment and because it does indicate the essential continuity, notwithstanding some changes in this bill.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="GEORGIOU" NAMEID="HM5">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Mr McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will comment on that as I go along. The Financial Management and Accountability Bill is effectively the same as the 1994 package. The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill makes the Auditor&hyphen;General's external audit functions more explicit and, in the broad, I support that. I worry as to whether the resources are going to be supplied to enable the function to be discharged for that broader brief. It is not an easy issue, particularly when you get into some of the grey areas of partially privatised organisations. The Auditor&hyphen;General, Mr Barrett, has written about some of the complications of that. While it is a very easy principle to assert there is actually, at the margin, an area of complexity which will require continuing judgment. It is my view that the appropriate body to undertake that external audit of Commonwealth bodies is, and remains, the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor&hyphen;General Bill itself is substantially the same. While it does strengthen the role of parliament, I regard that strengthening as essentially more apparent than real. But they are not changes with which I have any disagreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has worried me, and what has motivated the nature of the amendment, is that when in government we had a tedious repetition of a monopoly of virtue in these matters by members of the then opposition. I suppose 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1752"> this calls forth an extra element of passion from me because, as a senator at that time, I had to listen to some of the most sanctimonious contributions the world has ever heard from people who seem to have lost their enthusiasm for the task since the election. The now Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, the then Senator Bishop, did presume an absolute monopoly of virtue on this matter. The way the Auditor&hyphen;General's position was described, you would certainly have said that if Mahatma Gandhi had applied he would not have had the moral fortitude required for the position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the current Auditor&hyphen;General quite well and regard him both as a very appropriate and a very well&hyphen;qualified holder of that position who will discharge it with competence and probity. But Mahatma Gandhi he is not. It was stomach turning in the extreme the way in which this never&hyphen;ending series of sanctimonious speeches were made assuming that there was a monopoly of virtue on one side with regard to the question of accountability to parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some disagreements, mainly at the margin. I have not heard a member of parliament disagree with the broad thrust of the direction of this package. There are arguments about its priority. When we were the government the then opposition could not understand why it was not at the top of our priority list. It is interesting to see that we are now more than 12 months into this new government and it is still in the process of passing this legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Senate had allowed it to pass it would have been passed in 1994, as you know. The member for Kooyong is here but he is not usually one of the `monopoly of virtue' brigade. I would be very disappointed to see him join it on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within political parties and across political parties there are debates about some of the issues at the margin and about some of the issues of priority compared to other important matters. This government had to make those choices and it did. The previous government had to make those choices and it did. I would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have been much happier to support this package of legislation than the industrial relations package last year. If the government wanted some advice on priorities I would quite happily have said, `Yes, you should put the Auditor&hyphen;General package up well before that. This may do some good; that can only do damage.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, the issue of accountability that we are addressing, and which the Auditor&hyphen;General package deals with, is a very major issue in any modern democracy. It is one of the distinguishing characteristics of an open society: government being accountable to the citizens through the parliament. It is an issue that countries in transition to democracy sometimes have difficulty accommodating themselves to, particularly parties that have been in government in an authoritarian manner and find themselves meeting this new challenge of accountability. It is quite a revelation to those of us who are used to it to see the difficulty of transition for those to whom it is new.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accountability means much more than the Auditor&hyphen;General, but the Auditor&hyphen;General is, nevertheless, very important. The functions of regular audit and the opportunities for special audits when required should give significant public confidence to the Australian people about the probity with which their funds are handled. It enables us to balance and provide the freedom for people sometimes to take reforming initiatives in public administration without being unduly constrained by a body of rules governing every element of behaviour because we are confident that we have, first of all, a very efficient and honest Public Service and, secondly, a rigorous process of scrutiny by the Auditor&hyphen;General. The alternative to that is continuing to be entirely rules driven and not allowing initiative in public sector administration in ways that can enable value for money to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the Auditor&hyphen;General is one of the areas that emphasises the way in which the public sector differs from the private sector. It is one of the distinguishing characteristics&mdash;the way in which the Auditor&hyphen;General plays a much more prominent role and a much more arms&hyphen;length role than has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1753"> always been the case in the private sector. Of course, auditors are of increasing importance in the private sector. The recognition of that is growing. There was certainly significant debate and concern about the reality of the independence of some auditors of major corporations in the 1980s, to the great cost of shareholders and the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want mainly to turn not just to the accountability theme but to the theme of effectiveness and the efficiency audit process. I have always been one of those who has never been absolutely convinced that the Auditor&hyphen;General is the appropriate body for this function. I think it is a very important function, but I note with interest, for example, that the Coombs royal commission did not believe that this was a function properly conducted by the Auditor&hyphen;General. There should be a separate body, they contended, as I recall, within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, but that is not important to me. I think it is a very different function from the accountability function and, in time, we may want to look at whether there is a better way of doing it. I accept that the initiative has been taken for it to be done by the Auditor&hyphen;General and it is very important that it is done and that it is given increasing emphasis. That is not effectively changed by this package. I mention it only in passing as something which we might want to give consideration to over the years; I do not propose it as a criticism of this package of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government thought it was appropriate to conduct efficiency audits through the Auditor&hyphen;General's office and this government shares that view. It is clearly the majority view, and it is one legitimate view. I have some doubts about it which I think we can consider on another occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we need to take a broader view of the focus of efficiency audits. It is not just whether the resources, as provided by the parliament, are being used effectively, but also whether adequate resources are being applied to enable the goals, as outlined, for example, by the performance indicators, to be achieved. It is quite possible for taxpayers' money to be spent with absolute propriety and quite efficiently but the goals specified are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not being achieved because the resources are simply not sufficient to the task. The most competent people performing in the most efficient manner cannot achieve all goals with limited resources. So it is a question which I think needs, over time, to be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the reasons why I doubt, in the long term, that it is a function that will appropriately remain with the Auditor&hyphen;General. It is not a change, I have to say, which I expect this century. I still welcome the emphasis on propriety and accountability and, as I said before, with the capacity for that to be combined with flexibility because of our confidence in the rigour of the scrutiny of the Auditor&hyphen;General. I still support rigorous efforts to ensure that taxpayers' money is being taken care of responsibly, but also these same people&mdash;the taxpayers&mdash;are the consumers of the services and their interests in this capacity must also be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is that balance which we sometimes have lost sight of. People do not only want to be sure that their money is not being squandered. Of course, that is what they want. Of course, that is what they are entitled to be assured of, and it is an obligation we all have. When examples of waste are exposed, the public gets justifiably angry. But they also want us to be effective. They want the money to be spent to achieve worthwhile social goals. That is a balance that is sometimes missing in the narrower approaches to efficiency audits that are conducted at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me, in conclusion, to the specifics of the amendment. I have referred to both of the grounds of the amendment in my remarks to date, which are that, whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House is called upon to take note of both the delay in proceeding with this matter, given the priority that it was given both by the now government when in opposition and by the now Prime Minister in major speeches in the lead&hyphen;up to the election, and the fact that setting the bar very high in their time in opposition always used to encourage us because it looked very much like they were going to be in opposition forever. That is a mind&hyphen;set, when I was in government, which I enjoyed seeing in the opposition. They 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1754"> reflected it on occasions, setting standards that were, I thought, not likely to be ones that would be reflected by them should they be elected to govern. History has vindicated that judgment because the legislative package is not that which they advocated so enthusiastically in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the amendments. I also join with the chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in congratulating the staff of the Department of Finance, not only those present here tonight&mdash;who I congratulate personally&mdash;but also those people who have worked so hard in the department and others. I hope those present will take back from me and from all the parliament the congratulations of all of us for their work, which is almost now coming to fruition. While supporting the amendment, I will also be of course supporting the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

It has long been my personal view&mdash;it goes back to my 20s&mdash;that the Auditor-General is fundamental to maintaining the accountability and preventing the abuse of power across our political system. I applaud the Auditor-General Bill 1996 for achieving a substantial strengthening of the office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is the culmination of a lengthy process of review which began in 1989 with the JCPA's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: Ally of the people and the parliament</EMPHASIS>, which progressed through Labor's Auditor-General Bill 1994 and then the JCPA's 1996 report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guarding the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General</EMPHASIS>. This seven&hyphen;year process has perhaps been unnecessarily long. If we want to see the main gap in timing it is between the JCPA's 1989 report and the then Keating government's 1994 bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that, while I do not see all evil on one side, I think that Labor's amendment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is of the most profound hypocrisy. How the opposition, particularly the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), can now, after waiting five years before formulating their bill, complain about the 12 months lapse between the election of a new government and its legislative priorities and the introduction of a significantly amended and strengthened bill is, I must say, in the spirit of fairness and bipartisanship, entirely beyond me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The election of the Howard government has meant that the commitments entered into when we were in opposition, namely, to establish a completely independent Auditor-General so that a fearless and authoritative surveillance of government departments can occur without intimidation from the executive, is now about to be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is a part of a package of bills which are important in themselves. I do not think that any of them are more important than the Auditor-General Bill 1996; I believe it is of paramount importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is vital in a parliamentary democracy that the key watchdog over the public sector be free to carry out its tasks, independent of interference from the executive. If the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General is compromised then so too is the accountability of the executive to the parliament and, through the parliament, the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996 bill addresses this fundamental issue of the independence of the Auditor-General through a range of measures: it establishes the Auditor&hyphen;General as an independent officer of the parliament; it provides a role for the parliament, through the JCPA, in the appointment of the Auditor&hyphen;General; it provides a necessary degree of security of tenure for the Auditor&hyphen;General; it grants the Auditor&hyphen;General a wide legislative mandate; it provides the Auditor&hyphen;General with substantial powers to obtain information; it provides various safeguards against the interference of the executive in the resourcing of the ANAO; it establishes the ANAO as a statutory authority under the direction of the Auditor&hyphen;General and it gives the Auditor&hyphen;General the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1755"> flexibility to engage consultants to assist in the performance of his or her function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key provision of the bill is its declaration that the Auditor&hyphen;General is an independent officer of the parliament. As the JCPA's 1996 report indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . very few people even in the bureaucracy, will ever know the details of the legislative framework that underpins the Auditor&hyphen;General's role, functions and independence. It is thus important to give the Auditor&hyphen;General a title that will encapsulate the features of that legislative framework.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The change in designation does express a special relationship that the Auditor&hyphen;General shares with the parliament as the key scrutineer of the executive and it clears up some of the ambiguity about the role of the office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The change is, I believe, symbolic. In politics, however, symbolism is important. The insertion of the word `independent' lays to rest any concern&mdash;and there was some&mdash;that the strengthened Auditor-General's relationship with the parliament might bring with it risks of the legislature interfering with the Auditor&hyphen;General's independence. A title which highlights the independence of an office, however, is of little value without provisions which guarantee the Auditor&hyphen;General's personal independence in terms of the mode and tenure of appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, the Auditor&hyphen;General has been appointed solely on the advice of the executive. In effect, this has meant that the auditee has been responsible for the appointment of the auditor. This practice has the potential to undermine the independence of the Auditor-General and it is inconsistent with the appointment of auditors in private enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, I believe, an imperative need for parliament to be involved in approving any appointment to the office of Auditor&hyphen;General. The bill, by giving the parliament, through the new Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, an effective veto over the appointment of the Auditor&hyphen;General, meets this need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my speech to the House on the tabling of the JCPA's 1996 report, I indicated that in my view the office of the Auditor&hyphen;General is perhaps the one Commonwealth office that would justify appointment until retirement. This bill does not provide for such a term but 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it does follow the JCPA's 1996 recommendation and fix the term for the Auditor&hyphen;General at 10 years. This provision is, I believe, an effective compromise between the existing system of appointment until retirement, under which there was concern that auditors&hyphen;general would retire in fairly short order, and the proposal for appointments of only up to seven years contained in the 1994 bill. I do not believe that the 1994 provisions would have been conducive to a strong and independent Auditor&hyphen;General and would have weakened the autonomy of the Auditor&hyphen;General. Importantly, the provision for a single term only will maintain the integrity and independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General and further the ability to perform his or her job without fear of reprisal from the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one of the primary means of securing the executive's public accountability, it is vital that the Auditor&hyphen;General has a wide legislative mandate to audit the various functions of the Commonwealth. At present, the Auditor&hyphen;General's mandate is somewhat ambiguous and subject to a significant loophole. Under the existing act, the Auditor&hyphen;General is appointed as the financial auditor of all Commonwealth entities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some statutory authorities, however, through their own enabling legislation, have been able to appoint an external auditor and avoid their accounts, records and financial transactions being audited by the Auditor&hyphen;General&mdash;and, by so doing, also prevent the Auditor&hyphen;General from conducting performance audits on them. The Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1996, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill, effectively closes this loophole and it will ensure that the Auditor&hyphen;General does audit the financial statements of all Commonwealth entities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to performance audits, the bill gives the Auditor&hyphen;General wider powers than ever to examine the efficiency of Commonwealth entities. The Keating government, in its 1994 bill, rejected the JCPA's view that the Auditor&hyphen;General have an unrestricted right to performance audit GBEs, or the alternative JCPA view that the JCPA itself should be able to request the Auditor&hyphen;General to perform an efficiency audit.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I take on board the conceptual arguments that GBEs are in general subject to accountability via the marketplace&mdash;an argument which indeed the Keating government made with special force&mdash;in fact these constraints do not always work and, taking into account the fact that government business enterprises do spend vast sums of taxpayers' money, I feel it is reasonable that parliament should have the capacity to make judgments on its own GBEs based on evidence provided to it by the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does not give the Auditor-General completely free rein to examine the activities of GBEs; it does, however, give him a much greater range of  power to conduct performance audits on wholly government owned GBEs than the 1994 bill proposed, as long as the JCPA, the responsible minister, or the Minister for Finance requests such an audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Auditor-General's wide legislative mandate is to be effective, it must be backed by sufficient powers to obtain information and powers to disclose this information to the parliament. The bill provides for the Auditor&hyphen;General to continue to have wide powers to obtain information and documents, and to take evidence under oath. These powers are limited only by the laws relating to parliamentary powers, privileges and immunities and other such laws which are passed expressly to exclude the operation of the Auditor&hyphen;General. This latter provision has been included to ensure that parliament is made aware of such exclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The gathering of information is only one half of the equation, however. Accurate, complete and instructive reporting to the parliament also requires that the Auditor-General be empowered to publish the information which is obtained during the audit process. While I believe that the Auditor-General should have some discretionary power to exclude particularly sensitive information, I do not think it is appropriate that the Auditor-General be unduly restricted by the executive from reporting information to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is on this issue that the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1996 departs significantly from the recommendations of the JCPA&mdash;in part, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because it has a definition of public interest in it, in such general terms that practically any form of moderately interesting information about government activities could be fitted into one of the categories, if the government had a will to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, the bill prevents the Auditor-General from including any information in a public report if the Attorney&hyphen;General has issued a certificate stating that disclosure would be contrary to the public interest. To its credit&mdash;and once again, if the Labor Party is concerned about  effective consideration of its 1994 bill, then it should look at some of the significant differences between the 1994 and 1996 bills&mdash;the bill does specify that in circumstances where the Attorney-General has issued a certificate in relation to information in a public report the Auditor-General must state in the report that the information has been omitted and why the Attorney-General has issued the certificate. This is a substantial improvement on the provisions which were proposed in the 1994 legislation, which placed no check whatsoever on the exercise of the Attorney-General's power to issue a certificate&mdash;but perhaps the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) had a particularly warm spot for his previous position as Attorney&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Resourcing lies at the heart of both the symbolic and functional independence of the Auditor-General. Legislative ambiguity as to who in fact should accept responsibility for the Auditor-General has often led to situations of neglect by both the parliament and the executive&mdash;and this was noted by the JCPA in 1989 when it observed that the Australian Audit Office, as it was then known, was in a state of crisis and underresourced. It took five years for a bill to go forward after this observation by a non&hyphen;partisan committee which was, incidentally, chaired by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In general, however, the responsibility for resourcing the Auditor&hyphen;General has come under the umbrella of the executive, with the less than satisfactory situation that one of the primary checks on government performance and expenditure is heavily reliant upon that executive for the resourcing of its activities. While accepting that there is no evidence that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1757"> any government has deliberately sought to exert pressure on the activities of the Auditor&hyphen;General by manipulating its resources&mdash;although there are other forms of pressure&mdash;such arrangements do of course carry that very potential and, in doing so, compromise the true independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor-General Bill 1996, working within real constitutional constraints regarding the appropriation of funds, makes an important contribution towards insulating the Auditor-General's resourcing from executive influence. It does this by providing for the JCPAA to examine the estimates of the ANAO and make recommendations to the executive before the budget on the appropriate level of funding for the office. The ANAO's estimates and the recommendations of the JCPAA are then considered by the executive as part of the normal budget process. The bill importantly also provides for the JCPAA to report to both houses of parliament regarding the ANAO's draft estimates. These mechanisms provide for a higher level of input from the parliament, through the JCPA, on matters of resourcing and for greater transparency in the funding arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also guarantees the ANAO access to parliamentary appropriations and gives the Auditor-General the authority to approve a proposal to spend money under an appropriation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An independent Auditor-General must also have at his or her disposal the tools with which to carry out the duties of the office, and in this respect the creation of the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory agency under the direction of the Auditor-General is an important provision of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In granting the Auditor-General this degree of independence, the parliament is ensuring that the office is able to perform its important task of examining government activities. Following the recommendations of report 346, the current legislative package has added to the JCPA's functions the task of being the Audit Committee of Parliament. Under these changes the new JCPAA will, as I have already indicated, have a role in appointing the Auditor-General and advising the Auditor-General about the parliament's audit priorities, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as well as an input into decisions about the resourcing of the office. In addition, the bill empowers the JCPAA to approve the appointment of an Independent Auditor and to consider the Independent Auditor's reports. These arrangements, I believe, will help to facilitate the Auditor-General's accountability to parliament for the effective discharge of the audit function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1996 provides the legislative basis for a symbolically and functionally independent, yet highly efficient and effective, Commonwealth Auditor-General. I do believe that it places Australia at the forefront of world practice. The bill provides for a degree of separation between the Auditor&hyphen;General and the executive which has been lacking under current arrangements. It strengthens the role of the parliament. It also gives the parliament, through the JCPAA, an important function in relation to the Auditor-General's role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to commend a number of people. The plaudits for Finance have been flying thick and fast and I would like to add my bouquet to them. I would like to commend the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) for his very considerable role in the framing of this bill. It is the government that has to bear the pressure of added scrutiny as the result of the strengthened and more independent Auditor-General, and this government has bitten the bullet and we are almost there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to extend my thanks to the former Auditor-General, John Taylor. In his term as Auditor-General, he campaigned strongly and in a committed fashion to bring about reforms which would secure the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General, strengthen the Auditor&hyphen;General's relationship with the parliament and provide for a strong audit office for the future. I believe he did an exceptional job as Auditor-General, producing reports of the highest quality, in the face of substantial political criticism and ferocious attacks from some ministers in the Keating government. Anyone who does not recognise the history of the Auditor&hyphen;General in the last few years of the Keating government in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1758"> personal and professional terms is missing a significant part of our legitimate recollection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I wish to thank the chairman and members and staff of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The JCPA has been working for a long time, in a bipartisan spirit, to bring about reform of the Auditor&hyphen;General. It worked in a bipartisan spirit between the years 1989 and 1994&mdash;for five years&mdash;without an outcome. It also worked together in the years 1996-97 with an outcome. The JCPA has produced a number of quality reports since 1989 and I consider the bulk of the JCPA recommendations which have been included in the current bills as a great tribute to their endeavours. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), making one of his occasional forays into the House, has said that we are almost there. Almost there? Certainly not so near to the mark as the former opposition, now the government, would have had it with the amendments they moved to the legislation in 1994 in the Senate. It is very important to realise that this legislation actually contains a significant retreat by the then opposition, now the government, from the position that prevailed and they advocated at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation proposes, for example, that the appointment of the Auditor&hyphen;General be arranged with the agreement of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. That is a very fine proposal, but the amendments that the coalition moved in the Senate when the bill was brought forward by the Australian Labor Party actually proposed that the Auditor-General could not be appointed unless two&hyphen;thirds of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts agreed with the appointment. That would have ensured that an appointment was not controlled by the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple truth is, of course, that the majority of members in the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are inevitably government members. So the executive, through this mechanism, still holds the key to the appointment of the Auditor&hyphen;General. It is true that this legislation does do some important things, but most of the important things it does are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> merely a reflection of the legislation that was introduced in 1994 by the Labor government. Those areas where we have seen backtracking need to be mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate also amended the Labor legislation to ensure that, where the Attorney-General was of a view that particular matters should be suppressed in relation to the Auditor-General's report, there should be consultation between the Attorney-General and the chair of the Joint Public Accounts Committee. The present bill proposes that the Attorney-General is able to require the non-disclosure of information if he or she has issued a certificate to suppress that disclosure. Of course, had we proceeded in such a way we would have been charged with running a regime of secrecy. In fact, we were. The regime of secrecy has now been brought back into place, courtesy of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coalition members in 1994 were very keen to ensure that the Auditor-General was able to conduct performance audits on Commonwealth government business enterprises and amended the bill to propose that they be so entitled, except for partially privatised enterprises. In government those matters which were of great moment and fundamental importance to the democratic functioning of the parliament have been abandoned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an example of stunning hypocrisy here. It is an issue that was given considerable weight by the then opposition in its stonewalling of the 1994 legislation which went a considerable way to preventing measures of this nature coming into place at that time and deferring for two years the important implementation of the bulk of the recommendations that had been made by the Joint Public Accounts Committee. That history needs to be known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, it is true that the legislation that has been brought forward today is welcome. It will be the fourth Audit Act passed by the parliament. It reflects the recommendations of a number of reports of the Joint Public Accounts Committee, a committee on which I served for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt, too, that there was a very tortuous process between the recommendations of the Joint Public Accounts Commit 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1759"> tee and the implementation of the legislation. That long process was largely due to the difficulty in getting agreement to the package because of the very insistence on these matters, that I have referred to before, from the then opposition in the Senate. The then opposition declined to enable the legislation to proceed in the form that the then government had proposed and insisted on measures of the nature I have indicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a difference a year makes. We now have the government, refreshed by its awareness of its own need to be self&hyphen;protecting to some degree I suspect, coming before this House and saying, `Well, we are more than happy with the weight of the approach that the Labor Party took in relation to these matters. We will adopt it. We will congratulate ourselves for that approach. We will ignore those areas where we had insisted on higher standards. We will ignore those areas.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are entitled to come to the dispatch box on this side of the House to say that we have a situation where the government is, at least, capable of very flexible standards: one set of standards which it articulates, advances and fights fiercely for when it is in opposition, and another set of standards appropriate for government when it comes before us and says, `Well, the measures we are now proposing are ones upon which we will congratulate ourselves and request the Australian public to give us credit for.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian public can look behind these things and will be, I think, legitimately expressing some scepticism. This goes with the other range of measures which the government had set out to say that it would bring about higher standards. Higher standards require consistency. Higher standards require that you do not articulate propositions, move amendments in the Senate, argue for propositions on the basis that those amendments are fundamental to the legislation and then, when you are in government, delay for a very substantial time the implementation of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now a year since the election of the new government. It has had months and months where this legislation would have been ready for introduction into this parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment. It has not brought it in. The kind of scrutiny that will flow from the work of the Auditor-General under these enhanced reporting conditions will not start to flow for a time because of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the community is entitled to say that this whole process has been unduly delayed because of the way in which the Liberal and National parties have tried to have their cake and eat it too. They have one set of standards in opposition, yet, when in government, legislate in a way which is more consistent with the approach of the previous government and yet seek the high ground by asserting to the public that they ought to be congratulated for the way in which they have operated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of things that are important in relation to the Auditor-General's legislation. Some of it is rhetorically important rather than practically important. For example, the change in name of the Auditor-General as an independent officer of the parliament. It is included in the legislation, but the provisions of the bill make it plain that this really is a piece of political window&hyphen;dressing because it says that there are no implied functions, powers, rights, immunities or obligations arising from the Auditor&hyphen;General being an independent officer of the parliament. That, in itself, is merely a rhetorical expression of what the Auditor-General ought be rather than a guarantee of some specific charter that flows from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are welcome measures in this legislation which include the statutory formation of the basis for the Auditor-General which would prevent any undermining of it, in a simple sense, by the executive government. In terms of the appointment of the Auditor-General, it would have been far better had the coalition parties maintained the position they put in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the position of Auditor-General becomes vacant, they will be in a position to insist on the appointment of their nominee. The provision requiring the agreement of the Joint Public Accounts Committee is really only window&hyphen;dressing because the government has a majority on that committee. The opportunity to establish a process requiring 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1760"> consultation with all parties within the parliament in order to gain support for the appointment of the Auditor-General has been missed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also very interested in the way this debate has proceeded that we have had little reflection on the experience in Victoria. In Victoria the Kennett government has undertaken one of the most savage attacks on the independence of an Auditor-General in Australia's constitutional history. It has required the Victorian Auditor-General to put his position repeatedly and publicly. This has drawn concern from distinguished academics and people concerned with the propriety of public administration both in the private and public sectors and has been much agitated in the press.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an interesting contrast between the high standard asserted and claimed to be implemented by this government in this legislation and that practised by its state Liberal Premier in Victoria. It would appear that that practice is entirely inconsistent with the direction of this legislation. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) said the other day that you can choose your friends, but you cannot choose your relatives. I think it is very important that we do have some consistency of approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I trust this legislation will do is set a benchmark for the auditing of public accounts Australia wide. This is good legislation because it really reflects the package that we introduced. It is deceptive legislation in that the government claims it is distinctly better and improved. It is deceptive because it does not pick up those elements which the coalition asserted were vital for the establishment of a fully independent Auditor-General when the legislation was previously before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key area where there will be considerable concern is performance audits of Commonwealth government business  enterprises. It may be that the reason there is to be no requirement for performance audits of such agencies is that the long-term strategic objective of this government is not to have any Commonwealth government business enterprises or to sell them. In a sense, they would regard these provisions to be ultimately 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> redundant. Whatever their objectives, we will have government business enterprises with us for a considerable time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the coalition put that as an amendment in the 1994 package and asserted the importance and obligation of this parliament to be able to scrutinise the workings of such government business enterprises in which significant amounts of taxpayers' money are committed it touched a nerve with many in the community. Those people who believed that we would have a more transparent and more effective regime would be concerned that the coalition in government has decided that those particular approaches can be expediently abandoned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising but it is disappointing that the current government have changed many of the positions that they vigorously argued when this legislation was being debated in the last parliament. They have now seen the virtue of the approach adopted by the previous government but without the courtesy of recognising that fact in any of the speeches that have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now turn to some other points about this legislation that merit some short comment. As well as the changed arrangements for the establishment of the statutory office, its designation as an office of the parliament and an extension of the rules regarding reporting using a modern, streamlined and approved financial management framework, the bill also includes a number of consequential and transitional provisions including the renaming of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts to the Audit Committee of the Parliament and giving that committee the additional responsibilities of reporting on the operations and resources of the Australian National Audit Office, examining the draft budget of that office, reporting recommendations to the finance minister in both houses of parliament, determining the audit priorities of the parliament and advising the Auditor-General of those priorities. They are useful tasks to be given to the joint parliamentary committee. I would think that as the Audit Committee of the Parliament that body will continue to be as energetic as the previous committee was in the past.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1761">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you would be aware that the foremost committees of this parliament would be the Joint Committee on Public Works and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. On both of those committees the chair is recognised with additional remuneration and greater support through the parliamentary committee system. You have chaired one of those bodies&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With distinction. The parliament is in fact done great honour by the way in which members from both sides have approached their task as members of those committees and as chairs. In the main the work of those committees proceeds in a largely non&hyphen;partisan way. Of course, that changes from time to time, as when the former Senator Bishop decided to use the committee system for her crusade for the prime ministership. She is now, I think, more modest in her aspirations. That aside, the work of those committees in the main is that of members of parliament working diligently over a long period of time, with a very effective staff to provide background assistance and support. I think this parliament really has a lot to thank those members for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I also join in saying that no government really ever likes the work of the Auditor-General. If the audit office is to do its task properly and fearlessly, it will from time to time say things which will form ammunition in the public environment for criticism of government administration. Therefore it does need the support of the audit committee of this parliament. The measures that have been introduced today will help the Auditor&hyphen;General and his office do that task well. My only regret is that this has not been associated with a proper recognition of the fact that the government has resiled from propositions that it put before and is crowing loudly about small changes it has made but is not recognising the work that had gone in over a long time by the previous government to achieve these objectives.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight in support of the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill and cognate bills. One of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> major achievements of the coalition in the introduction of this bill has been the 12&hyphen;month delay in bringing it into parliament. I was working in the RAAF as a legal officer when these three separate bills that were proposed to replace the Audit Act were introduced. At extremely short notice we had to rearrange a number of procedures, a number of finance orders and regulations, and a number of our training and skills requirements. This was in very crucial circumstances, because these bills prescribe offences&mdash;misappropriation of public moneys&mdash;which need to be tracked; evidence needs to be taken and prosecutions made. It took a while for those of us who had any dealings with the act to become acquainted with the jargon that was being used&mdash;for example, prescribed authorities becoming GBEs&mdash;and with the subsequent orders and regulations and the proposed amendments and how the changes would impact on our work at the coalface.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the members opposite who have spoken in this debate have probably been in parliament too long and have failed to recognise the effect of such sweeping changes to the Audit Act, which we have been operating under since 1901. It has got a close tie to our constitution. Chapter IV of the constitution under `Finance and trade' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund, to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under appropriation made by law.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Audit Act was introduced in 1901 to regulate these requirements of the constitution. In 1901 we did not have government prescribed authorities or government business enterprises or government companies or authorities or government having major shareholdings or quangos or whatever. In 1901 we barely had a Commonwealth. So, yes, the Audit Act was a fledgling act which has struggled on to 1996, but it was one that we were all familiar with. We were familiar historically with the changes that had been made to it and then three major, sweeping 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1762"> changes came through. They deserved some delay in the Senate; they deserved some public comment; they deserved some Public Service scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between go and whoa something can pass through the House of Representatives in a very short period of time. The first thing the public knows about it is when it is introduced to this chamber. It is that time between when it becomes public in this chamber and when it is discussed in the Senate that the public has a chance to become familiar with the changes. It is in the subsequent time that the people at the coalface, as in the Public Service, get some knowledge of how the changes are going to affect them, right down the bottom of the food chain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subsequent entry now of these bills has been a blessing in disguise. This change did cause a lot of confusion at the coalface. It did make a lot of people nervous. If the opposition are worried about scrutiny of public funds or scrutiny of government expenditure, perhaps they should not have so vigorously opposed&mdash;or perhaps should even have introduced themselves&mdash;a charter of budget honesty. Probably one of the most appalling aspects of the previous government's time in office was that during the 1996 election campaign the public was not aware of a $10 billion hole in government spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I assure you that the Auditor-General probably will not find such glaring accounting errors, but the charter of budget honesty certainly will provide that for the public. This government is not afraid of public scrutiny. We have long held ourselves out for open and very transparent government, as previous speakers to this bill have stated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor-General's position must necessarily be fairly independent from government but, as always, it comes back to this parliament to be legislating for the good and the welfare of Australia. Therefore, the appointment and selection of an Auditor-General is a very crucial task to be undertaken. It is a very skilled and complex matter to follow the various avenues of funds that are available to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We no longer just have consolidated revenue. We now have the three government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> funds that were not contemplated in 1901. We also now have the various government bodies. The Commonwealth now operates as a private person in a commercial way, not just as a parliament or in a legislative nature. Most of these changes have been recognised in these bills. It probably was long overdue that we got rid of the Audit Act, but people were comfortable with it, and I think the time to get used to the changes has been very valuable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The separation of the liabilities of Commonwealth authorities and companies was an appropriate action in separating those responsibilities and offences into one act and leaving the Financial Management and Accountability Bill as a crisp, very distilled, easily read bill for those who have to deal with it at the coalface. Again, a lot of the use that this will have for people at the coalface will be in the orders and regulations that are made subsequent to these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you can see from the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill, there have been a number of changes made to assist in the transition that will be necessary as people get used to moving from operating under one system with one set of terminology, one set of forms, one set of reporting procedures, to something that is a little different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend these bills to the House. The government has acted wisely in its entire handling of this legislation. I am glad to see that it does receive the support of the opposition. I think that the public servants who created the bill and sought a more workable form of the Audit Act were probably long overdue in doing it. Keeping the people who have to use the bill down at the lower end informed of the changes, comfortable with the changes and happy with the transition was a necessary part of its introduction.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that officers such as the national auditor are seen to be independent and free from executive control. In some ways I have missed a real opportunity here because I have been particularly interested to ensure that the Ombudsman, if you like, gets a bit of an advantage of the tailwind that the Auditor-General is enjoying with this legislation. The Auditor-General has always been well served by having one of the original three parliamentary committees to report to&mdash;that is, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The Ombudsman has not been so fortunate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was privileged to be the chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee&mdash;and I know your interest, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, as the serving deputy chairman of that subcommittee&mdash;I was always interested to try to make sure that we had an Australian focus, and that it was not just in our region or worldwide. So I was very pleased that we extended for the first time an invitation to the Human Rights Commissioner to report to the subcommittee but, more recently, the subcommittee has been pleased to invite the Ombudsman, and I think that is very important. I see roles such as Auditor-General and Ombudsman as adding significantly to the effectiveness of the parliament and the effectiveness of the scrutiny on the executive and administrative arms of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Ombudsman has not enjoyed the same relationship that the Auditor-General has. One of the things in this bill is to style the auditor as an independent officer of the parliament. Some have suggested&mdash;and maybe they are quite right&mdash;that really these are just words, that there is in a sense no legislative substance to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important for us to try to use words to delineate the role of the auditor and the Ombudsman from other agencies that are operated and funded from the Commonwealth public purse.

I should have taken the opportunity to present an Auditor&hyphen;General Amendment Bill that would have had the same effect because, when I think of who are the independent officers of the parliament, I can really only think of those two&mdash;the Auditor-General and the Ombudsman. As it is, I must say that I am pleased that the Senate committee will be bringing down a report on the bill. Hopefully, the Human Rights Subcommittee will mention some of these issues when they table their report following the Ombudsman's appearance before them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we really need to do is define independence. I think the first thing you will run up against, whether in government or in opposition, is ministers or former ministers who say, `It's up to the executive government to control the purse.' I have some sympathy with that view, but I think it is important to understand when controlling the purse to what extent the role of an organisation or an officer is expanded or contracted in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst this bill gives the committee the responsibility of indicating to the parliament's independent officer what his or her priorities should be, do we need to be more prescriptive? Is it an issue that we need to tighten up a little? Do we need to indicate that we are funding so many audits or efficiency reviews that need to be done? You can get into problems in that, as much as you try to dimension the work, you find for unexpected reasons that you are getting deeper and deeper into issues and are requiring more manpower to get on top of them&mdash;particularly with efficiency reviews&mdash;which then takes more time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is at the table. For the first time, we have actually had the Auditor-General do an audit into the Family Court, and that is an interesting issue. I certainly believe that it has been a beneficial thing for the auditor to do an audit into the Family Court&mdash;not the way they make decisions or how they make decisions but how the rest of the operation is going. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1764">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that, when the Auditor&hyphen;General actually responded to a request of the parliament and the Attorney-General to do the audit, that was nowhere on the screen. They had no idea that report would be required, and I commend them for their actions. I understand that an even more detailed report is to be released shortly, and I must say that I am looking forward to that. If you are not careful, I think you can become a little too prescriptive in terms of trying to define, not in dollar terms but in program terms, exactly what you are hoping the auditor will do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Ombudsman suffered a 30 per cent funding cut, it had a diabolical effect on people's ability to access her&mdash;and indeed on her ability to respond to people making complaints about administrative decisions. She is not able to look at all the casework that she normally would have, and this means that ordinary Australians are missing out on an important element of justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were to look at the budget of the Ombudsman or what we should recommend she does, we should do it on program terms and target exactly the scope we would like to see her perform under. We should respond to the complaints, bearing in mind that, just like the Auditor-General, she should not always look at individual problems. Clearly, when there are systemic problems, she needs to deal with them rather than the individual cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to take up too much more time of the parliament. This legislation has been a long time coming. It was proposed in the last government, but I do not want to make too much of that. It has already been said that the then opposition, now the government, insisted on changes in the Senate. For example, they felt it was absolutely vital that there be a two&hyphen;thirds majority approval in the committee when it came to the appointment of any new Auditor-General. Of course, now it is a simple majority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure if I am not trading places but, as I understand it, there are nine members of the government on the committee and six members of the opposition. You could get a simple majority amongst the government, even with 50 per cent of the National Party representation defecting. But I am sure that, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the deliberations on the appointment of an independent officer of the parliament&mdash;which the committee would be charged with&mdash;any residual partisan politics that were involved would be set aside and the most meritorious person would be selected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation talks about the common reporting required under organisations. I notice when you go through the list of companies with reporting requirements that most of them&mdash;regrettably&mdash;have either been partially privatised or will shortly be partially privatised. About the only one not listed in the library briefing is Australia Post. I must say that under this government I am not too sure that that may not happen in the future, although I think it would be a regrettable thing. I just want to read the amendment that the opposition has moved:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question the Australian people ought to be asking is: why is it that we are considering the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1996 this evening some seven years after the original handing down of the report by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which contained many of the recommendations that are being enacted tonight? That report considered in 1988 and handed down in 1989 has been some years in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1765"> actually arriving. The report was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: Ally of the people and the parliament</EMPHASIS>, but somehow it never quite made it to the forefront of the consciousness of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government were happy to have it bubbling away in the backwaters of the committee, but somehow they were always reluctant to have it come forward for the vote. No doubt the chairman of the committee was preoccupied with secret women's business under a bridge somewhere in South Australia at the time, while the government, impervious to the level of accountability which the Australian people deserve and are fully entitled to, continued to march on spending the taxpayers' hard&hyphen;earned dollars with gay abandon. The previous government seemed to be inebriated by this sense of power and importance; and the poor taxpayer down there at the bottom of the heap&mdash;the rabble&mdash;never really seemed to enter into the consciousness of decision makers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But under this government we have seen a changing of the guard. We have seen a fundamentally different attitude. I would like to begin my contribution by quoting from the headland speech by the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, entitled `The role of government, a modern liberal approach', which was delivered in June 1995 at the Menzies Research Centre. I would like to quote a number of paragraphs from page 22 with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, which really outline the new impetus behind the passage of this bill. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">No person who holds parliamentary sovereignty dear could be other than disturbed at the steady decline in both the actual power and the reputation of the parliamentary institution. Much of the responsibility for this can be fairly sheeted home to the Australia's Labor Government of the past 12 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reversing this trend uniquely lies within the power of the government of the day. Our party system dictates that if the executive has a will to by&hyphen;pass parliament&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which the previous executive most certainly did&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">only a major revolution from within the government party&mdash;which might imperil the government's very existence&mdash;can prevent that occurring. For that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reason I wish in advance of the election of a Coalition Government to commit the next government of this country to a series of reforms which will restore greater authority, dignity and meaning to our parliamentary institutions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill is entirely consistent with the much broader philosophical commitment of this government to enhancing the role of this parliament. The Prime Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will establish a completely independent Auditor General so that a fearless and authoritative surveillance of government departments can occur without intimidation from the Executive . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Coalition the Auditor-General will be an officer of the Parliament. He will be funded from the Appropriation for the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These reforms will go some way towards restoring the proper role of parliament and I hope a return of some respect and trust and a greater understanding of what occurs inside Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, has ably outlined some of the more detailed provisions of the bill. I wish to go back to some of the first principles which underline the philosophy behind this legislation. By way of contrast, the French philosopher Proudhon was the one who said that `private property is theft'. This is the guiding thought behind the whole socialist philosophy which suggests that individuals are under some sort of moral obligation to forfeit their income, the fruit of their labours, for some concept of the social good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a tradition which I belong to. My own view is that a man is entitled to the fruit of his labour and that it is the men and women in the cities and towns of this country, the breadwinners of Australian families, who are better placed than the government, than the state, to make decisions about the best use of the income which they generate. I belong to that philosophy which is guided by the eighth and 10th Commandments of the Jews which are `Thou shalt not steal' and `Thou shalt not covet that which is thy neighbour's'. Upon these foundation stones of private property we have built a quality of life throughout the developed world which has never before been witnessed in history.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1766">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that basis, the taxpayer has not only the right but, in my view, the duty to deprive the state of whatever revenue is not strictly entitled to according to law. As for the state, it must discharge an onerous balance of proof. It must show not only that moneys were spent for the purposes for which the parliament authorised their expenditure but also that those purposes involved a greater public good than that which would have been achieved if the revenue had been left in the hands of those private citizens who generated it. When you consider that the state&mdash;broadly speaking, the Commonwealth&mdash;has its hands in the pockets and wallets of Australian people to the tune of $115 billion a year, one might be excused for feeling that excessive and oppressive taxation is much closer to theft than is private property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that regard, I speak today on behalf of the many small business operators in my electorate of Parramatta who are struggling under the weight of taxation. I speak for Mr Tony Wehbe, who serves me kebabs from his cafe right opposite my office in Church Street. You will find Tony opening early in the mornings to catch the passing commuter traffic, serving fast food throughout the day, working behind the counter in front of the grill in temperatures of about 45 or 50 degrees, sweat pouring off the brow, still in there at 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock at night cleaning the fat off the grill and wiping down the tables and counters. I submit to you that we as a government had better have a pretty compelling reason to reach into the till with the frequency with which we do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, fundamentally, is about giving the Tony Wehbes of this world some reassurance that the moneys expended by the state are being expended for proper purposes. It is a bill which restores the parliament to its place at the centre of probity and accountability of the executive. As we look back through history, we can see that our Westminster tradition has constantly worked to preserve the place of the parliament in the broad scheme of the three tiers of the judicature, the executive and the legislature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look back to Alfred the Great as an inspirational example who, in the introduction 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of his witan, or council of wise men, provided the first adumbration of this parliament&mdash;of the idea that the executive does not govern in a vacuum but governs with the acquiescence, with the advice and with the consideration of the people. We must never lose sight of the people, without whose revenue we would have no capacity to function as a government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the pleasure just this evening of having dinner with Sir Peter Lawler, who was decorated for his extraordinary contribution to public life in this country, in the city of Canberra. He remarked over dinner that Ben Chifley and R.G. Menzies both shared the characteristic of having a deep respect for the tax dollar contributed by ordinary Australian citizens. Likewise, as we look at the principle of the independence of the legislature and the commitment of this government to the preservation of the parliament, I note the way in which the Speaker was dragged to his chair at the opening of parliament by the members for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and Lyne (Mr Vaile). This brings to our recollection the example of Charles I, who stormed into the House of Commons and demanded of Speaker Lenthall the five members of the parliament who were resisting overarching initiatives of the executive, to which the Speaker responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Majesty I have only eyes to see and ears to hear as this house directs me.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was an historic moment, a watershed in carving out the boundaries of the power, of the independence, of the autonomy of the parliament. This bill falls very much in that tradition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its principal purposes are to re-establish the Office of the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia as a statutory authority answerable not to the executive but to the parliament. It clarifies and broadens the powers and authority of the Auditor-General and it entrusts to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts the additional role of the audit committee of the Commonwealth parliament. It also governs the process of appointment and safeguards the removal of the Auditor-General. In total, it represents a fairly substantial shift in power from the executive back to the parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1767">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that regard, it is kind of an echo of the bill which was introduced into the parliament of the United Kingdom in 1983 entitled Parliamentary Control of Expenditure Bill. The then Leader of the House, the Hon. Norman St John Stevas, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is no exaggeration to say that this Bill raises a constitutional issue of major and first class importance. For 700 years the power of Parliament has rested on one thing above all others&mdash;its control of the granting and spending of public money.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I emphasise that the government has no money of its own. Whatever money it possesses comes with the acquiescence, with the support of and in the gift of the Australian people. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was over that principle that the civil war was fought. It was over that principle that the House of Lords was deprived of many of its powers in 1910 and it is that principle which has led to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And, indeed, this bill before the parliament today. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an intrinsic part of those reforms I had the honour to introduce as Leader of the House in the early days of the present Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But, most importantly, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They were designed to shift the balance of power away from the bureaucracy of Whitehall, back to the elected representatives of the people at Westminster.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the reason I have great pleasure in rising to support this bill. It represents a very substantial strengthening of the power of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see happening is something which is very unusual. So often Canberra has this rapacious appetite for power and for revenue, but in this instance we are seeing the executive government taking a step back and deliberately strengthening the hand which has been entrusted with its probity, with its accountability, with a searching scrutiny of expenditure by the executive. In that regard it is an unusual piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It echoes a statement made by an American politician. It was once said that one ought not to judge the quality of an idea by reference to the individuals who subscribe to it. That may be a necessary caveat to the remark attributed to the 1964 US presidential aspirant who lost the subsequent election to LBJ by, I under 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stand, the largest margin in American political history. That aspirant was Barry Goldwater. He wrote in 1959, before his ill-fated run for President, that the American people should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . entrust the conduct of our affairs to men who understand that their first duty as public officials is to divest themselves of the power they have been given.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the whole spirit and character of this piece of legislation. It is about the executive divesting itself of its arbitrary powers. It is about the submission of the executive to the Australian people through the parliament in the form of a much higher level of executive accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It provides for audits of various kinds. It strengthens the hand of the audit office and of the Auditor&hyphen;General. It provides for proper purpose audits which examine whether or not expenditures have been within the ambit of a strict parliamentary authorisation, for probity audits which look at the question of whether expenditure benefits the community rather than the party in power and for efficiency audits which seek to ensure that the funds themselves are well spent. In each instance the Howard coalition government is deliberately strengthening the hand of one of its potential principal critics, in the full knowledge that that extension of power may provide a source of embarrassment to the government at some stage in the future. It reflects a commitment in this government and a belief that fostering a culture of probity is, in the long term, not only good politics but good government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons I commend the bill to the House. It is consistent with the commitment of the Prime Minister. At the conclusion of the sittings last week, we heard about the extraordinary number of questions which had been answered in the House since this government came to power and the fact that the Prime Minister had been in the chamber for every single question time&mdash;except for the two instances when he was not in Australia&mdash;since coming to government. That reflects the commitment of the Prime Minister to a full&hyphen;time parliament&mdash;the parliament is not some sort of an irritant on the back of the executive. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1768">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It reflects the Prime Minister's and the government's commitment to a truly accountable executive. It is not as if the parliament is there as something that has to be gone through which gets in the way of the real business of governing. It is an example of the fulfilment of the Prime Minister's commitment prior to the election to re&hyphen;elevate the parliament and restore it to its place as the engine of accountability and as the most direct link back to the Australian people to ensure that their hard&hyphen;earned tax dollars are expended for the purposes authorised by this parliament and in the most efficient manner possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it from the contribution of the previous speaker, the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), in particular that we are considering this matter as one that can range far and wide and beyond the particular content of the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill and cognate bills. As Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and someone who was involved in two of the three reports which relate to these matters, I found a range of the issues broached by the member for Parramatta were not part of the consideration that my committee made in relation to these bills and issues. On that basis, for a start, I will take him up on a couple of the points he made and then go on to some other issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills before the House tonight&mdash;there are four of them&mdash;have the support of the opposition. There is an amendment, but essentially they have our support. They have support for a very good reason: essentially they are our bills. There have been only minor adjustments made by the government to the bills that were out there over the last couple of years and certainly around the time the Prime Minister made his headland speech which the member for Parramatta quoted from so extensively. There are some questions here. There is also a little bit of hypocrisy. When looking at the previous speaker's contribution, the fact that questions are not answered in question time is probably another issue that should be raised. The question of ministerial codes of conduct and how they can be flouted and treated like something out of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mission: 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Impossible</EMPHASIS> is another issue. The fact is that these bills are essentially Labor Party legislation, with some minor amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn to a couple of issues for a start to give you an idea of some of the other aspects of the government's hypocrisy here. For example, there is quite a history to the issue of the appointment of the Auditor-General, and it is an important one, because all members of the chamber would agree that the Auditor&hyphen;General ought to be independent and ought to be seen to be independent. The major changes in this bill are essentially&mdash;and this has been said by members of the then opposition who are now in government&mdash;symbolic. The symbolism is important. I agree that this is something that we should be doing, but it is largely symbolic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we go into the history of what has been happening around these bills and the considerations that have occurred&mdash;there is quite a history there&mdash;we find, for example, that in report 331 from the Public Accounts Committee there was a recommendation that the minister should seek the approval of the Leader of the Opposition or his/her nominee, the JCPA and an Audit Committee of Parliament. That was partially accepted by my government at that time&mdash;but with consultation, no powers of veto.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that amendments were made to that bill when it got to the Senate. For example, in schedule 1, part 2, on page 16, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a person is not to be appointed as the Auditor&hyphen;General until:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) a proposal that the person be appointed has been referred to the JCPAA under Section 8A of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public Accounts Committee Act 1951</EMPHASIS>  and the proposed recommendation has obtained the approval of at least a two&hyphen;thirds majority of the JCPAA . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That two&hyphen;thirds majority in effect means a veto. That was the now government's position in relation to this issue when this bill was before the Senate. Following on from that, the bills were withdrawn. Following the proroguing of parliament, the government reintroduced them and the Public Accounts Committee, under report 346, came down with a recommendation that:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1769">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Audit Committee of Parliament should approve, by a three&hyphen;quarters majority, the appointment of the Auditor&hyphen;General and conduct public confirmation hearings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The interesting thing is that, when we look at the bill today, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister must refer recommendation for appointment of Auditor&hyphen;General to the JCPAA for its approval&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">a simple majority. Essentially, we had a position where the JCPA and the Senate, at the behest of the current government prior to the last election, was talking about a veto and broad consensus approval whereas the government is now talking about a simple majority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA is a very constructive committee of the parliament, and I am proud to be deputy chair of it, but it has a majority of government members. From our point of view, the key issue there was having a veto or a situation where whoever was appointed was broadly supported. I bring no reflection upon recent Auditors&hyphen;General because, certainly at the time of their appointments, their appointments were welcomed, but there is a fundamental change here. The change is significant because it says something about this government's stated positions. Its position was that there should be a veto where all major components of the parliament agree. But now we see that commitment counts for naught.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue which I think was quite significant was the question of conducting performance audits of a Commonwealth authority, that is, a government business enterprise or any of its subsidiaries. The JCPA's position was very much that this was a good idea and certainly that it is something that the government should embrace. Senate amendments, again sponsored by the current government, were successful to the earlier bills along those lines. The circumstances were then that report 346 from the JCPA fired on with the same recommendation. But here we go again! When we go to the provisions of the bill, the fact is that the Auditor&hyphen;General may conduct a performance audit of a GBE, or of any of its subsidiaries, if the responsible minister, the Minister for Finance, or the JCPAA requests the audit. That is quite a different position from the likely operation of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this bill. The situation is the control being removed from what was proposed to the Auditor&hyphen;General to a situation where it has to be by recommendation following through from either the minister or the JCPA, both organs which, as I said earlier about the JCPA, have a government majority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The circumstances, as you see them in some of these issues, are very different. We have had a position where the current government has changed its mind on some key issues. I know, from what I have seen of some government members who have been involved in this process right the way through, that they have some difficulty in coming to terms with it. Certainly it has been followed by some embarrassed silences in some meetings that I have been involved in around the question of this legislation in recent times. It does raise an issue about the question of credibility in this government. It is one thing to herald and to parrot on about the fact that this is a new broom, a new approach, and that there are major changes occurring in the operation of this place, but when we look at the detail we can see some fairly skilful window dressing. For example, the ministerial code of conduct was heralded and trumpeted by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as a significant break with the past: here was a move forward in standards in this place, in standards of executive government. But what did we see happen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As minister after minister was tripped up and otherwise found wanting in their own personal behaviour and the institution of their duties, that code was weakened. It was weakened by the words of the Prime Minister himself. It went from being a bold new blueprint for the future&mdash;a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Star Trek</EMPHASIS> document&mdash;to a situation where it was very similar to the position of the previous government, to a situation where it was recommendatory rather than compulsory, to a situation where, `You've already got two ministers; you're not getting any more.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the Prime Minister on the fact that so many more questions being asked in question time. The one thing I would like is a few more answers. We are not getting answers on this side of the House. We sure 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1770"> are getting a chance to ask a few questions, but we are not getting any answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is supported by both sides of the House because it is good legislation. Essentially, it leads to a much needed revamping of the question of the Auditor&hyphen;General and the question of financial and regulatory frameworks in relation to Commonwealth enterprises. It is long overdue and is something that the parliament should broadly support. I know that the view within the audit office, and also within senior management in government departments, is that this is a significant reform, that it should go ahead post haste. Hence I have great pleasure in supporting it here in this House today. I could go on further, but I do not think I will quote from Alexander the Great, St John the Righteous, Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse. I might just leave it to roughly considering the question of the bill at hand, a bill which I am proud to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to be part of the JCPA, which has had a very constructive role in making these bills even better. I am happy to see it coming before this House and I wish it a speedy carriage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish on one other note which again raises the question of accountability, of this new broom. The central issue which relates to the question of the role of the Auditor&hyphen;General and the capacity for the Auditor&hyphen;General to discharge his duties is that of funding. If you do not have the money to employ enough auditors, you are not in a situation where you can audit government departments properly and ensure the value for money which was mentioned by the previous speaker, although I am quite sure he has not read the bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue relates to the question of the JCPA which, under this legislation, will become the JCPAA because it will take on the role of the Audit Committee of Parliament. This committee is an incredibly crucial committee of the parliament in the role it performs, but again the question of funding is crucial to the performance of its duties. This government, for all its talk about accountability to parliament, has severely cut back on resources to parliamentary committees since 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it became the government. This is not only in this area, but right across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members would know, if you do not have the research resources available to your committees, you will not be able to perform your duties as well as you would like. That has implications for the scrutiny of government legislation, it has implications for the scrutiny of government action that is non&hyphen;legislative and it has important implications for the operation of this parliament both in its role of performing a review of what is done by the executive and as an organ to recommend changes to the executive. The JCPA will have an increased role, a role of even greater importance in the operation of this place, but it will be in circumstances where at this stage there is no increase in resources. That is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has recently, for example, with taxation legislation, forwarded these on to the committee for consideration. I am quite supportive of that. I am not supportive of the situation where drastically reduced time frames are put forward in getting reports back and the situation where there is a limited amount of resources&mdash;and getting smaller&mdash;in the coverage of those sorts of issues, which all have implications for the effective operation of those committees and the roles that they play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That again relates to that question of the audit office. The fact is the audit office has a very important, independent and symbolic role, which is improved by this legislation. I support that symbolism. The real issue is the question of resources to perform its duties, and on those issues we are still awaiting the government's response in ensuring those resources are available to properly perform those sorts of activities. I commend the bills to the House and I wish them a speedy passage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very keen to join in this debate on these four bills: the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1996, the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1996, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996 and the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1996. I was somewhat mystified by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1771"> member for Bruce (Mr Griffin) when he started to complain about question time in this parliament. If there is one thing this government ought to be praised for it is the accountability that it has brought to question time. It really is quite a contrast when you look at the previous government, of which he was a member, and when you remember how difficult it was to even get the former Prime Minister to come into the chamber, let alone answer questions. We had this ludicrous situation where the part-time Prime Minister and members of the frontbench were fronting for only half the time the parliament was sitting and, at the same time, the number of questions that they were prepared to answer was becoming progressively fewer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on setting the record, as he points out, for letting 20 questions get up each day. That is the best performance we have seen in the parliament for 20 years. I think that is something that this government ought to be congratulated for rather than being criticised, as the previous member did in his contribution to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to see that these bills modernise some of the controls over Commonwealth finances and I think, as we move along, that is an important development. It is important to see that they are very much involved in modernising the controls over businesses owned or operated by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill, it is indeed, as the member for Bruce said in his speech, similar to one that was introduced by the previous government. But the reason it was held up was that the then government, the Labor government, rejected some opposition amendments and it lapsed because of the election. It is important to remember that the amendments that were to have been put forward by the opposition in the previous parliament would have allowed the parliament to have a greater say in the appointment of the Auditor&hyphen;General. They would have also allowed the Auditor&hyphen;General to conduct performance audits of government business enterprises and allowed the Joint Committee 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of Public Accounts to act as an Audit Committee of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill on audit amendment acts on our commitment to establish a completely independent Auditor&hyphen;General, and that is very much in contrast to the previous government. Who could forget the way that the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, got in such a rage over the Australian National Audit Office's powers to conduct an efficiency audit of the National Media Liaison Service, otherwise known as aNiMaLS, which was employed by the Labor Party as its method of instituting an almost Goebbels type attack on the opposition of the day?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, who could forget the role that the audit office played in the sports rorts affair, which led to the demise of the then minister, Ros Kelly. Who could forget&mdash;we still have the evidence before us today&mdash;the way that the previous government used the audit office to assist it in its finances with Centenary House, where it pushed the audit office into a rental scheme that is still an embarrassment to the Commonwealth today?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor&hyphen;General Bill provides for the re-establishment of the Office of Auditor&hyphen;General under the proposed new accountability regime. It more clearly defines the roles and powers of the Auditor&hyphen;General and it strengthens the function of the current office beyond the level of current laws and, at the same time, protects the office from interference from the executive or the parliament by providing a statutory safeguard in line with the government's commitment to confer genuine functional independence on the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put it another way, the bill re&hyphen;creates the audit office as an independent statutory body, something that I believe all Australians would normally expect&mdash;unfortunately they did not always get it from the previous government, but certainly they are getting it from this government. Together with the transitional provisions of the bill, it provides for a wider role for the parliament in selecting the Auditor-General through what will be the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit as well as monitoring the performance of the Auditor&hyphen;General and the audit office. In 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1772"> addition, it re&hyphen;establishes the parliament's auditor of the Australian National Audit Office as the Office of Independent Auditor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pay tribute to the fact that many of these provisions arise from the work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. In fact, in 1988, the JCPA inquiry into the operations of the Auditor&hyphen;General produced the report headed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: ally of the people and parliament</EMPHASIS>, in which it recommended major changes to the Auditor&hyphen;General's operations, particularly that the Audit Act be replaced with more modern legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may have taken nine years, but this government has acted on that recommendation. The government has accepted the joint committee's recommendation that it assume the additional role of Audit Committee of the Parliament. Changes to the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 to that effect are included in the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1996 and are complemented by provisions in the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also details the processes of appointment and conditions of the office. It also outlines that, as a statutory office holder, the Auditor&hyphen;General will continue to be appointed by the Governor-General and that this appointment be on the recommendation of the appropriate minister. The administrative arrangements and orders are expected to continue to specify that the Prime Minister will be the appropriate minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill, the minister must seek the JCPA's endorsement of the proposal prior to advising the Governor&hyphen;General of the proposed appointee. The parliament, through the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, will have the right to veto over the government's choice of the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to what the previous speaker, the member for Bruce, has said, this does give the parliament a say through its veto rights in the appointment of the Auditor&hyphen;General&mdash;which, I think all honourable members would agree, shows that this government does recognise the important role that the parliament plays, not just the government, in ensuring that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Auditor&hyphen;General is someone who is truly independent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, the safeguards are maintained for the removal of the Auditor&hyphen;General by the Governor&hyphen;General&mdash;a petition of both houses of parliament through the same session  being the necessary requirement. Again, that is a very important safeguard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will cement the Auditor&hyphen;General's mandate in legislation. Under existing arrangements, the Auditor&hyphen;General's mandate was partly derived from legislation and partly from government policy. The Auditor&hyphen;General will now have the mandate to audit financial statements of all government bodies and it will also be able to conduct performance audits on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the bill, the Auditor&hyphen;General will conduct performance audits on government business enterprises only if it is requested to do so by the parliament or by the minister. Of course, it is important that they are subject to accountability, at the same time recognising the importance that a government business enterprise is required to pursue maximum market performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also significant to note that, if a body were a partially privatised Commonwealth company, it would not be subjected to a performance audit. And the reason for this would be simply that such a decision would be taken in consideration of the interests of private shareholders, recognising that such a report would receive publicity which could be detrimental to shareholders. In order to avoid this, the Auditor&hyphen;General's role in such circumstances will be as the mandated external auditor of their financial statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also significant to note that the bill will permit the Auditor&hyphen;General to enter into an arrangement with any person or body to conduct financial statements audits or performance audits for them and to provide them with services of a kind that are normally performed by auditors. This provision would be at the discretion of the Auditor&hyphen;General and it would occur only if it fell within the Commonwealth's constitutional power to do so and the Auditor&hyphen;General considered that there was a benefit to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1773">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, this would mean that under the bill the audit office would be the statutory authority with the exclusive functional responsibility of the Auditor&hyphen;General, and this would then demonstrate the government's commitment to the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the Auditor&hyphen;General to fulfil his obligations to the parliament, the bill would allow the Auditor&hyphen;General and authorised officials full access to information and documents needed to perform the role. It is important to note that these powers are accompanied by strong secrecy and penalty provisions for any person performing this role. Again, that does provide the sorts of safeguards that people would expect under such a bill, and the government is very keen to ensure that we continue to provide those sorts of safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill re&hyphen;establishes the office of an Independent Auditor, and this would be the parliament's auditor as part of the audit office. But this office would mirror the role of the Auditor&hyphen;General in relation to the Commonwealth. Clearly, this Independent Auditor would be a part&hyphen;time statutory officer appointed in much the same way as the Auditor&hyphen;General. It would mean that the appointment would be made by the Governor&hyphen;General on the advice of the appropriate minister. As I said earlier, this would be expected to be the Prime Minister in this case. Again, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts would have the same right of veto over the government's choice of nominee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, this bill provides the Auditor&hyphen;General with a great deal of freedom to get on with his task and at the same time it offers the Auditor&hyphen;General an excellent statutory environment for performing the role required and expected of the Auditor&hyphen;General of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An area in which I have a particular interest is Audit Report No. 6, which was conducted by the Australian National Audit Office. It was looking into the Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. This report was tabled in September last year and has since been referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administra 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion, which I have the honour to chair. I think this report outlines in one way just the sheer scale of the task that the audit office often has to undertake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite significantly, in this report the office found that most portfolio departments were unable to provide timely advice regarding their exposure to the instruments listed&mdash;in other words, looking at the level of Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. I think all Australians would be a little bit disturbed to find that this accountability was not as great as we would like to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report showed as a result of the audit census that some of the departments were slow to come in with their reports and, when they did, there was often an absence of adequate records on the level of exposure of the Commonwealth to these risks. What was rather disturbing to note was that the audit felt it was unable to provide a definitive statement of overall Commonwealth exposures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is significant to note that the audit office has estimated the level of Commonwealth exposures in the departments to be of the order of $222 billion. I just repeat that: two hundred and twenty&hyphen;two thousand million dollars. Of course, this does not include many exposures on which it is very difficult to put a dollar value. While I do not wish to unnecessarily concern people, it is a significant amount of money. Nonetheless, it is well known that in the vast majority of these guarantees, indemnities, letters of comfort and so on the risk is very, very low. But it is a very significant amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The audit office in its report to the committee actually showed that there are a number of exposures there which really do raise very serious questions about the operation of some departments, particularly under the previous government. One such case is the indemnity, which the Commonwealth still carries, out of the sale of Aussat to Optus. When Aussat was sold for $800 million, of which $500 million was paid up front, there was also found to be a series of promissory notes issued for payment in subsequent years. These promissory notes represent bearer securities, but when it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1774"> came time for the surrender, it was found that the relevant department no longer had them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in order to cover this, the Commonwealth has had to carry an indemnity issued to Optus so they could guarantee the payment. In other words, what this means is that if these notes happen to turn up at some time in the future, the Commonwealth has a liability of $300 million. I would have thought that most Australians would be rather disturbed to learn just that one example of the sorts of indemnities that the taxpayers, in the end, could be held liable for, should that risk be realised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also interesting to note that the audit office, in looking for the number of indemnities, guarantees and letters of comfort, identified 144,000 instruments in relation to this&mdash;not an insignificant amount&mdash;which shows, I think, the significance of the amount of guarantees that the Commonwealth is bound to. Mr Deputy Speaker, there are a number of other things I would like to get on to, but as time seems to be running short&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on these bills. They have had a bit of a chequered career over the last four years. There was an initial introduction of similar bills by the previous government which came through the parliament and were referred by the previous Minister for Finance to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, of which I have been a member. In the previous parliament we put together report No. 331, an advisory report on the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill and the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill. Those bills subsequently lapsed with the proroguing of the parliament, after going through the House of Representatives and passing through the Senate with an amendment that the House of Representatives was not prepared to accept. So I support these bills before the House tonight and want to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> congratulate the government and the minister on putting together a fairly wide&hyphen;reaching package of reform as far as the finances of the Commonwealth are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills replace the Audit Act of 1901, bring the financial management of the Commonwealth into the 1990s and prepare for the Commonwealth to go into the next century. Probably most important of all, and the area on which there has been the most public attention with regard to these bills, has been the role of the Auditor&hyphen;General. The JCPA presented two reports on the Auditor&hyphen;General, No. 296 and No. 346, the establishment of the position of Auditor&hyphen;General as an independent officer of the parliament being a recommendation in the latter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was fairly widely held that, after the activities of the previous government, the then Auditor&hyphen;General did not have any control over the financial management of his office. I think the previous speaker, the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), alluded to the establishment of the Auditor&hyphen;General in Centenary House and the exorbitant rent that was being paid. The Auditor&hyphen;General of the day, Mr Taylor, had no control over that. The JCPA of the day recommended that the Auditor&hyphen;General have more autonomy over the budget of his department. But I note in this bill the recommendation has been picked up to give the Auditor&hyphen;General more independence, not only in name but more explicitly by being an independent officer of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that in both reports on both pieces of legislation, in the previous parliament and this one, the JCPA recommended that the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill should provide that the Auditor&hyphen;General be appointed as the auditor of all Commonwealth entities and the Auditor&hyphen;General has a general mandate to initiate the full range of audits in relation to all Commonwealth entities, including performance audits of GBEs, a recommendation that, as a member of the Joint Public Accounts Committee in both the 37th Parliament and the 38th Parliament, I supported. I note that the previous government was reluctant to pick up that recommendation, but in this bill it has been picked up to the extent that it provides for GBEs, both authorities and companies.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1775">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor&hyphen;General may only conduct a performance audit where the Minister for Finance or the responsible minister, or the JCPAA, requests such an audit. So that has been broadened from where it used to be and that is welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also welcome the move by the government to establish an audit committee of the parliament as one of the functions of the JCPA. It will now be known as the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures that we are supporting this evening are very important for the ongoing responsible financial management of the Commonwealth accounts and reflect the way that the Commonwealth conducts its business with Commonwealth corporations and entities, as well as authorities. These bills reflect that. There is also the perception in the community that we need to see more autonomy and independence as far as the Auditor-General is concerned, and his closer connection with the parliament rather than with the executive and that there be less control over the Auditor-General by the executive than there is by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bills to the House. I certainly am not prepared to support the amendment that has been put forward by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). The amendment is a pious one. The opposition, then the government, had the opportunity to negotiate these bills through the House in the previous parliament. They did not succeed in doing that. The current Minister for Finance has done a good job in putting this package together to take the Commonwealth's operations in this area through to the next century. I commend the bills to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

These bills are very important to provide the necessary formal machinery for the Commonwealth to make an orderly transition from its current ageing and inadequate financial framework.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that opposition members in their contributions here this evening focused upon the length of time that it has taken the coali 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion to re&hyphen;present these bills to the parliament. It is important to say very briefly that these bills were considered very carefully upon our taking government. We reassessed the bills on their merit, and I did this particularly in my role as Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a very high regard for good financial management and, in fact, we did not unnecessarily delay the reintroduction of these bills. The bulk of the government's changes to the bills was in the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill in which we sought further advice from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which recommended to the government several suggestions for enhancing the independence of the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of these suggestions have been drafted into the Auditor-General Bill as it is now before us. The bill is now a reflection of a fully functionally independent Auditor&hyphen;General in both symbolic and practical ways beyond that which was available under the current laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that aside, I again commend the bills to the House. I thank the opposition for its support. I once again acknowledge and appreciate the considerable amount of work undertaken by all sides over a number of years. I particularly commend Mr Maurice Kennedy. I thank the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) as chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the work that the committee has done in these very important proposals presented in the bills.</PARA>

The $220 million project is certainly deserving of the support of all members serving in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This would relieve the Cessnock, Newcastle and Maitland councils of problems associated with the presence of national highway traffic. The main roads in the township of Cessnock, including those in the central business district, have effectively been a de facto national highway since Easter 1988. The proportion of national highway traffic which does not short cut through Cessnock is a nightmare for residents living on Weekley's Drive, Beresfield, and residents of Maitland East and Maitland West. Those residents attempt to access the national highway via the Chelmsford Drive intersection, which the member for Paterson referred to during his adjournment speech last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The townships of Lochinvar, Greta and Branxton would all receive relief from national highway traffic as a result of the construction of the Kurri Corridor. The new found proximity of the Upper Hunter, with all its coal and agricultural product, to Sydney and the port of Newcastle would provide an enormous boost to that part of my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the chances of the Kurri Corridor being constructed? What are the odds following the coalition's decision to cut $622 million from the national highway budget over the next four years? Mr Speaker, I remind you that this is a cut to a budget which is of the order of $840 million a year. We are talking about a very significant cut. My fear is that the odds are about one million to one. It is a very tragic decision for all the reasons I have already outlined. It is a tragic decision because of the loss of benefits which the residents in the Paterson electorate would have gained from the construction of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Kurri Corridor. The failure of the Howard government to commit itself to the Kurri Corridor is causing more immediate concerns. People living along the path of the road link are in limbo.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The former government was committed to it. People like Keith Thomas on Cessnock Road, Branxton, Valda McCloughlin of Lovedale and John Pyne and others living on Avery Lane, Buchanan, are in limbo. They do not know whether in the next five years or so a freeway will run over the ground on which their houses now stand. They cannot sell their homes or their properties. Mr Speaker, would you or the member for Paterson buy a property with such an extensive proposal hanging over its head? I think not. In my view, these people should be effectively compensated from the EIS stage of the development of the highway. The RTA would not lose any money because if the freeway did not proceed they could resell the properties and recoup their money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dilemmas do not end there. Cessnock council's legal advice indicated that whenever it is considering a development application it must consider the implications of the freeway on the development and the effects of the development on the freeway. The council's problems do not end there. The council is desperate to refurbish its struggling central business district but it cannot properly do so because of the existence of that heavy vehicle traffic that uses the main street of Cessnock as a de facto national highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It cannot attract state government funding for a simple bypass while the Kurri Corridor hangs over its head. It is a real catch 22 situation for Cessnock council. What Cessnock council and the people of my community need is an unequivocal statement from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) as to whether or not he supports this project. I support the project and I will continue to support the project. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS> </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today, I reported in the grievance debate that an Aboriginal community school called Culunga has serious concerns relating to its accountability in educational terms and its many forms of maladministration. This school is largely funded by DEETYA moneys hence the Commonwealth has a great interest in the functioning of this school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point out one of the areas of concern. The DEETYA funds are currently also used for homework classes. These homework classes cost something like $35 an hour and are provided after school. I am reliably informed that these funds are not used for homework classes. A BBQ is put on and the rest of the kids roam around the school. The people who are supposed to be teaching do not teach. Even more seriously, one of the people who was to receive these homework class moneys was in gaol at the time. He was in gaol for some time while he was still being paid the funds to teach homework classes after school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other concerns, which I gave a great history of this afternoon, are that the family members of the board pay each other in cash, for which there is, apparently, also no accountability. On 29 January 1997, nothing had changed. The school coordinator asked the chairperson of the board, who just happens to be her sister, for a cash advance. She said that she had run out of money over the Christmas break. She was told, `I will go and check.' Ten minutes later she was told, `Yes, you can have it; try and pay it back in December 1997.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier today I also referred to two documents. One was the letter from the school principal to the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations and another was the letter from the Australian Government Solicitor, which did an audit into the school. I seek leave to table those documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PK6">Mr RANDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Funds of ASSPA, which stands for Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness, are also under scrutiny at this school. There are many allegations that these funds are not being spent on the Abo 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> riginal students there and that in fact funds are being siphoned off in a rather dubious manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons and many others that I alluded to today, I call for an independent inquiry into the running and administration of this school, in particular in relation to its funds and the quality of education it provides, so that the children of this school can get a fair go. They are at a special Aboriginal school to get a special Aboriginal program, and the funds are not going where they are designed to go. Whether this inquiry is initiated through the many committees of this parliament or is determined independently in another forum, I would hope that the minister would take that request on board. There are allegations of gross impropriety regarding the funding of this school in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another serious allegation is that as of last Friday, the remaining two Aboriginal teachers at this school were sacked; they were given notice. These were the two teachers who have spoken out. It seems rather unusual to me that the two remaining very well qualified Aboriginal teachers who have come forward and spoken out are now being told that their services will not be required in six weeks time. That would leave the school with very few pupils and a skeleton staff to try to run the school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the school is going to be run on a skeleton staff with a handful of students, why should the school remain open when there are more appropriate schools locally? There is another Aboriginal school up the road run by Robert Bropho; there are Aboriginal programs in surrounding high schools and primary schools where the needs of the Aboriginal children are being met. I call on the minister and all those who are responsible to conduct an inquiry into the running of this school forthwith.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1778"><TITLE>Belmont Wetlands</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I want to raise is about Belmont wetlands in my electorate. I have raised this matter in the House on a number of previous occasions and I will continue to do so. Between Belmont and Redhead in my 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1779"> electorate there was once a unique coastal wetland. That was until BHP gained control of the surface rights of the land in the 1960s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BBHP&mdash;Before BHP&mdash;the wetlands, the high sand dune systems backing Nine Mile Beach, the continuous coastal wetland system, collected the run&hyphen;off from the Dudley, Whitebridge, Charlestown, Gateshead and Tingira Heights ridges and valleys. It filtered down through creeks and ponds into the only coastal wetlands system in our region. The 1892 maps showed that some of the water reached the sea by a creek at the northern end of Nine Mile Beach and some eventually reached Lake Macquarie via Belmont Lagoon and various connecting marshlands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Army map of 1941 shows the coastal dune system in the area in all its glory, with dune heights ranging from 15 feet along the back of the beach to a hundred feet further inland. The area was a unique coastal dune wetlands system, the jungle like conditions of which were utilised by the Australian Army to train troops for service in the Pacific during World War II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP has presided over the devastation of this once beautiful strip of coastal wetlands and dunes. First they mined the coal from beneath at Lambton B and John Darling collieries, which are now both closed. In the 1960s the sand dunes were mined for minerals. Up to this day sand has been continued to be removed and sold from what was once a beautiful section of Australia's coastline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where the hundred feet sand dunes stood the level is now flat. The fringes of the area are used as a rubbish dump by numerous people. People drive through there and see the rubbish on the edge and think, `This is rubbish land.' They would never go inside behind the rubbish to see what was once inside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reaction of BHP has been to mount the feeble excuse that now that the area has been devastated and despoiled, it should be rezoned to enable residential development and some wetlands refurbishment to take place. This would enable BHP to make a limited restoration of some wetlands and to construct some 1,400 homes in a fragile, sensitive, low lying 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> area between the east side of Lake Macquarie and the sea. It would create a huge windfall profit for BHP&mdash;in fact, a reward for its supervision of wanton destruction of a precious piece of our coastline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A local government study has been carried out. Public responses were invited by Lake Macquarie City Council. In my view these public responses and concerns have been treated, in the main, in a cavalier and unprofessional manner by council officers. When one reads through them one cannot help but form the conclusion that the council officers see their role as being dedicated to ensuring that BHP's application gets through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No attempt has been made to present an alternative utilisation of that coastal wetlands system and the council itself appears to be compliant towards BHP. In fact, some councillors are in awe of, even intimidated by, BHP. Strangest of all strangeness, the beach is owned by BHP. I cannot discover how BHP came to own nine miles of Australia's beach, but they own the beach. Some of the councillors say to me, `Don't make too much noise, because they may not give us the beach back.' The beach is riven by undertows. It is a very dangerous beach on which to swim; it is little utilised. It is a good fishing beach with gutters but a very dangerous area for swimming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So my response has been to invite BHP to try to fence off the beach. If you want the beach, put a barbed wire fence around it like you did during the war when it was a defence system. But the company has presided over the destruction of one of our most beautiful areas of coastline. Having made coal profits, beach mineral royalties, sandmining royalties and income from the area, it now asks for more. Suddenly, another arm of BHP, BHP Titanium Minerals Pty Ltd, has lodged an exploration notice for heavy minerals over the same area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had hoped that BHP would accept a responsible attitude towards this and hand that land, or lease it, back to public ownership so it could be redeveloped over time for future Australians. It has the potential to become a beautiful coastal wetlands system again, a system of national and international standing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1780"> that could rank as a major tourist attraction and a major recreational and leisure resource for Australians. So I think that BHP should be putting something back into the area it has devastated and that council should be rejecting outright the application for rezoning.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1780"><TITLE>Member for Forde: Parliamentary Activities

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to clarify a few newspaper articles that appeared in various daily newspapers this morning. The articles are trying to place some significance on the number of times that I and other colleagues have spoken in this chamber. They have wrongly asserted that I have not caught the Speaker's eye since making my maiden speech. I have in fact spoken in this parliament on 11 different occasions. I have participated actively in question time, which is, as we all know, the most well&hyphen;attended and lively debate in this chamber. I also strongly refute the implication in these articles that I am in some way the silent type. As anyone who knows me will attest, I am not shy in having my say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My aim is always to achieve results for the people of my electorate of Forde. Since being elected, I have tended to make a more direct approach and very often I have organised meetings and had discussions with ministers directly on issues of concern to my constituents. This tends to get results quicker than waiting for the legislation to be debated in this House. I do not for one moment decry the processes of this House, but I believe it is an unreal assessment to look at speeches in this chamber as a measurement of performance. Performance by anyone's measure is about results and, as many ministers will attest, I am tenacious in pushing and achieving results for Forde.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all know in this place, there are many ways of doing your job in Canberra. I am an active of member of seven committees. There are two standing committees&mdash;employment, education and training and family and community affairs&mdash;and five government committees, which are health and family services; veterans affairs; industry, small busi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ness, science and tourism; environment, sport, territories, local government and social security and primary industries and energy. As we all know, government legislation and policy are discussed at these committees before it is introduced in the parliament. That is where, I believe, I can have the most impact and make the changes that benefit the people of Forde.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am by nature a no&hyphen;nonsense person. I make no apologies for the fact that I have concentrated my efforts here in Canberra on where I can make the biggest impact. With the greatest respect for the institution of this parliament, in the vast majority of cases that is not in this chamber speaking after legislation has been finalised. I know that the local residents whom I meet at my regular open days in regional areas around the electorate, those I have helped by direct contact with ministers and departments and the many thousands I have met in my office and at functions will appreciate that my efforts over the past 12 months have been directed at doing my job and producing results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take the time in this debate to comment on an issue of great concern throughout my electorate and on which I have been working with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training&mdash;that is, youth unemployment. It is difficult to overstate the level of community support there is for the government's work for the dole scheme. People recognise it for what it is: the chance to keep young people involved, restore their confidence and self-esteem, build their work ethic and give them real hope for the future. I have spoken with many communities and business groups in Forde who are champing at the bit to get involved in work for the dole, and I have encouraged them to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made a protest to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) asking that the pilot programs be conducted in the regional areas of Beaudesert and Boonah.

He was a small shopkeeper. He and his wife toiled for the rest of their lives. When they sold their small business, they bought a small cottage and a couple of acres so they could run the pony for the granddaughter. That was what he wanted to do, and that was what he did in his life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, he passed on and his wife now lives in that cottage. Now the pressure is starting to come.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another group of individuals who may potentially benefit from retirement savings accounts are those persons close to retirement who may wish to minimise risk. Due to their capital protected nature, RSAs may be particularly attractive to those who in no way want to risk negative investment returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers who are looking for a convenient superannuation vehicle for small contributions under the superannuation guarantee arrangements will also benefit from the provisions of RSAs. Also, RSA providers will likewise benefit from being able to offer cost efficient delivery of superannuation and from enhanced customer relationships through the provision of one-stop shop services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me note that the coalition has long pushed for more choices in superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Price interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! The member for Chifley will be speaking soon. He will reserve his comments until then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DK6">Mr HOCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In fact, as far back as the late 1980s when we were in opposition, something that the honourable member for Chifley will become familiar with, we were suggesting the implementation of retirement savings accounts. However, the Labor Party wanted no part of retirement savings accounts. Why? It was because the ACTU was opposed to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACTU has been opposed to RSAs because under industrial award superannuation the ACTU got a say in the management of superannuation. Industrial awards do not generally allow for individual employees to make a decision on the fund where their contributions will be invested. The ACTU, and thus the Labor Party because they are hand in glove, have been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1785"> happy leaving workers out of superannuation decisions altogether. That is a funny thing for a party that fancies itself as standing up for the rights of workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the more distinguishing features of the RSA is that it will be required to be capital guaranteed, meaning that the amounts invested cannot be reduced due to negative investment returns. Subject to any fixed term of interest payments on the deposit accounts, funds in retirement savings accounts will be fully portable. That is, an RSA provider will be required to transfer part or all of an account to another RSA or superannuation fund at the account holder's request. Either an account member, or an employer on an account member's behalf, will be able to make contributions to an RSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By virtue of their capital guaranteed nature, it is generally expected that the returns offered by RSAs will be less than those offered by other superannuation providers. For this reason a number of individuals and industry groups wanted the legislation to provide for a maximum amount that can be invested in an RSA. I draw this to the attention of the member for Chifley who scoffs at the suggestion that this is a positive reaction to what the workers want, to what the people want. May I suggest that the opposition follow our direction and you too, one day, some day, long into the future, well after the member for Chifley has retired, may be given another opportunity on the Treasury benches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wishes to ensure that people's retirement incomes are maximised and it recognises that for some people RSAs may be an appropriate choice. The government strongly believes that restrictions on the amount that can be invested in RSAs are contrary to its policy of greater choice in superannuation and thus there will be no restriction on RSA balances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, it will be mandatory for RSA providers to advise account holders of alternative balanced portfolio products offering potentially higher returns over the longer term when their balances reach $10,000. The government believes that this adequately addresses concerns regarding the expected low return from RSAs as compared to an investment based superannuation fund. Ultimately, account holders will be informed of investment options and will be able to choose if they wish to maintain their funds in a retirement savings account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The supervision of retirement savings accounts is divided into two parts. First, the prudential supervision for institutional soundness of the RSA provider will be carried out under existing regulatory frameworks regarding, amongst other things, capital requirements and liquidity management. For example, in the case of banks, the prudential regulator is the Reserve Bank of Australia. Perhaps the Wallis inquiry will make a separate recommendation. In the case of building societies and credit unions, the prudential regulator is the Australian Financial Institutions Commission, AFIC, and state supervisory authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second regulatory element is functional supervision for compliance with retirement income and other non-prudential superannuation standards. These standards, which ensure that RSAs are maintained for genuine retirement purposes and provide for a well&hyphen;informed membership, will be carried out by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Again, that is subject to the government's decision about the outcome and recommendations of the Wallis report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the government's intent that the treatment of RSAs with regard to superannuation standards is as consistent as possible with that applying to existing superannuation products. For this reason, this bill is closely modelled on relevant provisions of the regulatory regime applicable to superannuation under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. Does the honourable member for Chifley remember that one?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1786">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, it is worth noting that, in connection with the preparation of this legislation, the government undertook substantial consultation with the relevant industry and consumer groups. Further consultation will be sought with regard to promulgating the regulations under the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It goes without saying that the primary purpose of superannuation is to provide individuals with a better income in retirement. This coalition government recognises that, in order to cope with the costs of the ageing population, it must encourage people to save throughout their working lives for their own retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, along with the government's other superannuation reform initiatives, provides a framework for a fairer and more flexible superannuation system that more readily meets the differing circumstances of individual Australians and, at the end of the day, encourages savings. This framework goes a long way towards addressing the serious flaws in the superannuation system that were left to us after 13 years of very hard Labor.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate that we are having this debate in the parliament. I think it comes about for much more significant reasons than may be understood by the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) and a number of his colleagues. In recent Australian history&mdash;and by that I mean post-World War II&mdash;superannuation has had a sad history of conservative governments neither understanding the need for it in the Australian economy nor understanding how they could bring it about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember my father talking about the great vision of Chifley. The member for Chifley (Mr Price) would be very interested in this. His vision in 1947 was to establish the national superannuation fund or pension fund into which the nation all agreed to pay a small percentage of their pay. That was the first real vision of national superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We still have&mdash;and you would be aware of this yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;old&hyphen;timers coming along and making the case that they believe a pension is a right. They reject the notion of an assets test and an income test, because they still believe what they were told back in 1948 that if they invested in this national pension scheme they would have a pension for life.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="PRICE" NAMEID="QI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr Price</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And what happened to it?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell you. Having established this national pension fund, the Menzies government, elected in 1949, under advice from Treasury, the banking system and the emerging life insurance corporations, immediately took that advice that a better way to encourage Australians to save was to go via the route of home ownership by encouraging them to take out home loans and by giving them tax deductions for interest on home loans. More significantly, they were encouraged down the life insurance road and given significant tax reductions if they contributed to life assurance and other insurance products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bear in mind that this was in the days of a tax regime where the highest income earners had a 60c in the dollar marginal tax rate. So the tax deductions that high income earners got for these contributions were much higher than those of ordinary working people. It evolved that white&hyphen;collar public servants had access to superannuation as we know it, and executives in businesses had access to superannuation, but increasingly further down the income scale, the less disposable income people had, and most of it was committed to purchasing a home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very little money was left over to contribute to these other savings products and, therefore, there were no tax deductions. What evolved was a savings system based around high income 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1787"> earners providing for their future and home ownership, and middle and low income earners remaining reliant upon a pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whitlam saw the error of this and had another go at instituting national superannuation. We would all remember quite vividly the strident campaigns that were run against Whitlam by the conservatives and the banking and insurance industries against national superannuation. With a Senate that was not prepared to pass his legislation, he also failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it continued until Labor's productivity trade&hyphen;off with the trade union movement in 1986&mdash;opposed by those on the other side in the parliament at every step, and opposed by employers as a tax on jobs&mdash;which led to the first three per cent contribution to this superannuation pool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to mention something that very few people ever talk about or understand about this. As a government at that time we successfully communicated to the general public the need for superannuation to provide for pensions for the future and the need to wean people off the public pension system. That is not a problem&mdash;everyone agrees with retirement income policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, what nobody understood was that the major deficiency in the structure of the Australian economy&mdash;and what was needed to give us some structural independence, to give us some opportunity to buy back the farm, to give us some opportunity to wean ourselves off overseas borrowing&mdash;was a long&hyphen;term `patient' capital base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor started this process of national superannuation in 1986, there was $40 billion in the super pool in Australia&mdash;mostly from white&hyphen;collar workers, public sector workers and executives&mdash;in the likes of National Mutual and AMP. That figure now stands at a staggering $350 billion. For those who run around fretting about Australia's foreign debt, Australia's net foreign debt is $180 billion. So twice the amount of foreign debt is already in the superannuation pool.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="PRICE" NAMEID="QI4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be much more than that. It will be much more than $500 billion. The member for Chifley is always conservative about these estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the challenge that the economy faces is the marshalling of this $350 billion plus to get it active in the economy. Labor's vision for it did embrace a lot of these strategies, and I will come to retirement savings accounts in this context in just a minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some aspects of this pool which should have been activated in our economy a long time before now. We hear a lot about falling interest rates for home loans. We hear a lot of preaching about competition in the finance sector and how wonderful it is. Of course it is. But where did it come from? Aussie Home Loans did not appear from nowhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aussie Home Loans is a securitising organisation that is funded in the vast majority by investments now being made by these pools. The arrangements that were made with the superannuation funds at the time of the productivity trade&hyphen;off was that one of their first products would be cheaper home loans for members, at least one per cent below the Commonwealth Bank rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of great irritation to me that it took them eight years to deliver. It was not as if these fund managers suddenly produced some fabulous new product for Australia that attracted the whole investment industry to them. People were made to put their money in these funds. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were five main goals. Home loans for the contributing members was one of these goals. That has now started to roll out very well. Because of the failure of the banks in this sector, small business finance was another. I notice that Aussie Loans is about to become 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1788"> Aussie Business Loans. There was supposed to be a proactive productive investment in the Australian economy in terms of refinancing large overseas borrowings in the private sector. They are only just starting to get interested in that now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infrastructure bonds were created for these people to come and invest in infrastructure in the Australian economy. For four years they sat around wondering how to do it and whether they should. The new treasurer has had to rule the line off them because the demand has become too great for infrastructure bonds. They have all rushed there now, and he is cutting it off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, on it goes. The most serious need in the Australian economy was proactive venture capital for the small and medium business sector. Why was it necessary for a Labor government to do all this with the providers of superannuation funds? I will tell you; it was because the banking system had failed. The banking system either did not understand the problem, let alone the answer, or it was not interested in these areas. The failure of the banking system is the principal reason. Those on the other side might go on about trade union trustees having control of money&mdash;that has always been something that they have been paranoid about. The industry funds are only a minor proportion of this $350 billion. It is there as of today. It is a paranoia about nothing. The paranoia on the part of the government ought to be about the failure of these funds to proactively drive investment in the Australian economy, which was the intention. It is falling out slowly and it will happen. Where were the banks in all this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made a very deliberate decision. Banks have not shown the skills or the expertise or the interest in marshalling and using long&hyphen;term patient capital. Remember that a lot of people on the other side of politics talked about superannuation as a tax on jobs. All those sorts of reasons were used to say why we should not do it. In Singapore, 40 per cent of the national payroll now goes into superannuation. Workers pay in 20 per cent and employers pay in 20 per cent. Employees borrow back for their home loans and all of their repayments go back into the funds. Employers borrow from the funds to expand their businesses and all their repayments go back. Singapore does not owe anybody a cracker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That vision of patient capital was Labor's vision, and still remains our vision. But we were not interested in having the banks in it&mdash;they felt that very bitterly&mdash;and so evolved the concept of retirement savings accounts. Yes, the super funds abused the early phases of this with small accounts and transient workers moving from one workplace to another, all those teething problems. They did rip people off with charges but they stopped doing it as soon as it was made clear that accounts with a balance of under $1,000 would be moved to the tax office, and that people would be paid the Treasury rate of interest, not charged costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The choice is there, very broadly, now but what we really have is retirement savings accounts with banks and no trustees. If you invest in these funds, you do not have any say in who is managing them but you can remove your funds and take them to another institution. That is your ultimate consumer choice. Why on earth would a government want to create a vehicle for people to save in but not give them trustees, unless they do not want people to have a say in it? Who does not want them to have a say in it? Obviously, the board and senior management of the banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake about it, this is opening a very big door for the banks, because they had been squeezed out of $350 billion. They paid their price and now they are getting their payback. By that, I mean, very straightforwardly and very bluntly, the banks were not the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1789"> Liberal Party's major campaign donors in the last election campaign for nothing. We all understand there is no such thing as a free lunch in politics.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. You are paranoid about the unions. You can be; it does not worry me in the least. This mob were not your biggest donors for no reason. The price was RSAs. If you do not find that convincing go and read the article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Independent</EMPHASIS>  of March last year headed `Ron's Party'. That is the article about Ron Walker, the federal treasurer for the Liberal Party, going into the National Bank and getting something that I have never heard of in Australia; an unsecured personal loan of $10 million to fund the Liberal Party's election campaign, when the organisation was bankrupt under Downer and no&hyphen;one was prepared to put a cracker in. Ron walks in and says, `We're going to unload him; we're going to bring back John and, by the way, you can have RSAs. We'll let you into super.' He got the $10 million unsecured personal loan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that this article has been published for two years and never once has anyone, from Andrew Robb down, protested in any way about it because the facts of it are correct. The Liberal Party was given a $10 million unsecured loan from the National Bank, on Ron's word. According to this article, and according to the comments of a number of members of the Liberal Party, a lot of people in the Liberal Party were very unhappy about it. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A federal Liberal parliamentarian&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">it can't be you, Mr Deputy Speaker, you are a National Party member&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I assume now a minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">who knew of the undertaking claims it was significant because the party "might not be able to get rid of him". This, he believes, could have implications for policy. "Walker is somebody who needs to be kept under control because otherwise he will try to use the power of the dollar to influence decisions of the party".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the fact of it. The banks were bitterly stunned by Labor saying to them, `You have a long&hyphen;term history of a lack of understanding and a lack of interest in the role of patient capital in the Australian economy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the 1980s and the surge of investment during the boom and deregulation, the banks did not acquit themselves all that successfully. So why on earth would you let them into this new pool when it was much more in everybody's interests to go for organisations that had experience with long&hyphen;term capital? That is in fact what Labor did. If I was to criticise our foray into this field, I would say that we overreacted to what happened in the 1980s. We put the most stringent prudential controls and responsibilities on the trustees and, as a result, the lag from receiving these funds and putting them into action in the economy has been far too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even a thing like home loans, which are just the easiest thing for any financial institution to do, took eight years. And it took them three years to understand and even get interested in infrastructure bonds, even with the federal Labor Government writing special legislation giving them a half tax deal. So she is a very conservative, slow moving juggernaut. But, make 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1790"> no mistake, it is a juggernaut. It is a huge pool of capital that has never existed in Australia before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all these economists running around saying that Australians are poor savers. What tripe! Australians are prolific savers, but they choose to do it in the form of bricks and mortar. From the day they start work they set as their savings goal buying their own home.

I do not believe those opposite understand it or know the potential of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am extremely disappointed at their long&hyphen;term aversion to superannuation. Remember, Chifley started it; Menzies knocked it off.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to make a contribution in the Main Committee in support of the government's retirement savings accounts legislation, which is the fulfilment of another election commitment. It has been interesting to listen to Labor Party members talk, particularly over the last 12 months, on different issues and different pieces of legislation that the government has been bringing forward since the Labor Party was voted out of office, after 13 years in power, by the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to listen to the previous speaker, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), talking about what happened during those 13 years as though someone else was in government, someone else was in charge, someone else had control of the levers. The Labor Party was in government for those 13 years. It had ample opportunity to address those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker was railing against the banks. I am no great advocate of the banks either, but the Labor Party in government had plenty of opportunity to deal with some of the issues that the previous speaker raised with regard to the banks. He asked why the banks 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1791"> should be allowed into this sector of the economy. It is all about competition, flexibility and choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, it was the Labor Party that hurtled down the path of a national competition policy to try and engender more competition in every sector of the Australian economy. This is just another part of that. That was old Labor. There has been a conversion on the road to Lismore or Adelaide or somewhere over the last three or four days with a change in the attitude of the Labor Party towards liberalisation, competition and those sorts of things. They are going in the other direction. It seems that they have completely junked the philosophy of their former leader and Prime Minister, Mr Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, RSAs are the fulfilment of an election commitment by the coalition. We acknowledged that there was a flaw in the superannuation system in this country where particular people in particular walks of life were making contributions of an obligatory nature into superannuation funds. They seemed to be drifting into the ether, whether they be itinerant workers or part&hyphen;time workers&mdash;they were making contributions but they were not in control of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went through a process in the history of Australia where obligatory superannuation was fine, but it was under the care and control of trustees. In some cases&mdash;and I underline that&mdash;the trustees were helping themselves to fairly heavy and handy management fees. A lot of people who were not making large contributions to superannuation funds were having them seriously eroded and they were losing a lot of the value of what they were putting away. That was devaluing the former government's philosophy of having obligatory superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition wanted to see some flexibility, choice and portability so that the average Australians out there&mdash;the battlers, if you like&mdash;had the opportunity to have some control over and understanding of what they were contributing to and were able to make that choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A point that, to my knowledge, has not been raised in this debate on the RSA legislation is that a lot of the people who will take the opportunity to put their superannuation savings into these accounts have a fair bit of ability and commonsense. They know when it is costing them too much for someone to manage their money. They know when it is a good product and when it is a bad one. They have the ability to research those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people are not dummies. They are fairly smart people. They have got their lives together and they are pretty well organised. They have the ability to manage themselves and manage these accounts. We should not underestimate the ability of the majority of Australians to undertake that exercise in a fairly smart way. They do not need so&hyphen;called smart trustees to manage their affairs for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, this product is all about flexibility and choice. RSAs provide low&hyphen;income and casual workers with an exciting new vehicle in which to invest their superannuation savings. RSAs represent the fulfilment of another coalition election promise. RSAs are something that the battlers have wanted for a long time. The Labor Party was unable to deliver on that&mdash;I think it has been raised already&mdash;and maybe that is because it did not suit its coalition partner, the ACTU, which is involved in the superannuation fund business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RSAs are simple, low&hyphen;cost, low&hyphen;risk superannuation products which can be offered by banks, building societies, credit unions and life offices, so RSAs are not just in the domain of the banks. There are a number of highly competitive institutions that will be participating in providing this product.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1792">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accounts will be owned and controlled by the member and subject to the same taxation and retirement income standards as other superannuation products, including preservation. RSAs will be able to accept superannuation guarantee contributions and contributions on behalf of non&hyphen;working and low-income spouses. RSAs will be required to be capital guaranteed, that is, a guarantee that the account will not be eroded by negative investment returns. That is one of the positive elements of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be no cap on RSA balances, rather, it will be mandatory for RSA providers to advise account&hyphen;holders of alternative, balanced portfolio products offering potentially higher returns over the longer term when their account balance has reached $10,000. RSAs are about flexibility and empowering people to make informed choices about their superannuation savings. I highlight that again. The majority of people in Australia have the ability to make those informed choices and decisions for themselves. They do not need governments to do it for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big winners from RSAs are average Australians, the battlers, if you like. In particular, the low cost, low risk nature of RSAs will be especially suited to people with small amounts of superannuation such as itinerant and casual workers, people wishing to amalgamate several small superannuation accounts and people nearing retirement who wish to minimise the market risk on their superannuation savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an interesting article, Mr Deputy Speaker, that appeared in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> towards the end of last year. It was headed,<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Control to shift towards retirees</EMPHASIS>. I will just quote a couple of paragraphs out of this article. It was an interview with Mr Bill Peck, a partner of the law firm Phillips Fox. He said that they could shift control of the system away from employers and fund trustees towards fund members. People with RSAs will have greater ownership and control of their RSAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Peck went on to say RSAs offer good support to the argument that where prudentially controlled institutions are concerned, a trust structure and a trustee or custodian only add to cost rather than protection. That is, in my mind, at the nub of what the government is trying to achieve here. As federal members of parliament over the years, we have received numerous representations from people that have been paying into different superannuation funds expressing their concern at the cost of the management of those funds. It comes back to the contributor. That burden is borne by the contributor. You do not mind a fair go; you do not mind paying for a service. But in a lot of cases it was, as I said earlier in my address, certainly a fairly healthy charge on behalf of some trustees that were managing those funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to note in an address in Sydney on 23 August 1996, the Prime Minister indicated that RSAs will be especially significant for women. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the RSAs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be particularly beneficial for women; many of whom have intermittent periods in the work force in their early years and attached to their retirement savings account is a tax incentive for a husband or wife to contribute up to a certain level, contributions on behalf of the spouse out of the work force.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Deputy Speaker, I indicated before that we believe that the Labor Party in government failed to address this very important element of superannuation, that there was a gap in the marketplace as far as superannuation was concerned. It is one of those issues that the previous Labor government failed to do enough about. It was raised on numerous occasions by the coalition in opposition over the last term of the last parliament. It was one of those issues that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1793"> demonstrates why Labor is in opposition and we are in government. When we spoke about these things, we showed the Australian people that we could understand the problem that existed in this area. We showed the Australian people that we had an idea of how we could go about addressing that problem. We also showed the Australian people that we believed that they had the ability to manage their own affairs and they did not need the heavy hand of government in there doing it for them. That was a very salient point. From personal experience people appreciated that understanding, that empathy that was shown by the coalition in saying, `Yes, we understand your concerns about this. A lot of the management fees that are being deducted from your superannuation funds are too great; they are too heavy handed; they are eroding the benefit that you are likely to receive.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia appreciated that. As I say, it is one of our election commitments from last year that is being fulfilled in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello) summed it up best in an answer to a question about retirement savings account in the House on 19 June last year, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Year after year the Labor government rejected the opportunity for choice and for people to open up retirement savings accounts. You were not interested in giving employees choice. You were interested in making sure that the money was controlled by the friends which controlled your government&mdash;the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a government which will give people choice. It is not beholden in the way that the Labor Party was to those privileged and special interests.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I note at this point the comments that were made by the previous speaker in this debate, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) with regard to the contributions that were made by some of the banks to the Liberal Party. I am not a member of the Liberal Party, and so I was not a beneficiary of any of those contributions. I might be wrong, but I thought from the report that was in one of the political commentaries in a magazine recently that there were also some contributions to the Labor Party from some of those banks. I might stand corrected, but I think you will find that there were.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I think you will find that there were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will close by quoting from one of our former colleagues in our last parliament who had a great deal to do with superannuation matters and certainly with the development of this policy: the then member for Bradfield, Mr David Connolly. The parliamentary secretary's second reading speech acknowledged the contribution of the former member for Bradfield, who was one of the early architects of the coalition's RSA proposal. Speaking in the House on 10 May 1995 in a debate on the Small Superannuation Accounts Bill 1995, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe in freedom of choice. We believe in greater competition. We believe in greater protection for contributors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And he went on to say that he was a great supporter of more choice in superannuation. He also said in that speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not new. All the countries of the OECD&mdash;Canada, the United States, Great Britain and many others&mdash;have products such as retirement savings accounts, which have the greatest benefit of all. You empower individuals, especially people with low incomes . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what this is about. It is an acknowledgment of the ability of people in that sector of our society to manage their own affairs, to have choice, to have the flexibility of where they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1794"> want to invest their retirement savings and not to have to put up with the products that are forced upon them by the heavy hand of government interfering in their private affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will close on the point that I made earlier with regard to the coalition getting through to the people of Australia the message that we understood their concerns about superannuation and that we were prepared to do something about making these products far more flexible for their use. We acknowledge the understanding, knowledge and wisdom that the average Australian has in managing his or her own affairs. The member for Burke also pointed out that, for a lot of years, people on average incomes have been investing in the family home. That is their nest egg that they have been building up: they have been investing in the family home. And that is exactly the point I make.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The point that I make is that Australians over the generations have recognised home ownership as being a very important forced means of savings, and they have always have that ability to make that decision for themselves and also to stick to the savings goal that they have had. We recognise the ability of people to manage their own affairs and, with the introduction of retirement savings accounts, we will provide the flexibility and the choice of product as far as superannuation is concerned, and we will be empowering the people to make that choice themselves.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been interesting listening to a couple of government members talking about superannuation. I want to respond to a couple of points the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) made. First, he said the coalition had been prescient in recognising that people did not want to suffer under the heavy hand of government as far as superannuation was concerned. Let me say that I do not know that there was any government superannuation company out there in the private market where the Labor government was compelling people to save with them. I am not sure, but perhaps the minister, when he sums up, could tell us just how many private superannuation companies are seeking funds to be placed with them by workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, it is a completely free market. As the honourable member for Bourke (Mr O'Keefe) said in his contribution, it had been a Labor Party policy. It had been a Labor Party desire to have one national fund. But historically this had been resisted and when superannuation proposals were being put through in the Hawke/Keating Labor years, as much as we would have liked to have done it, in fact, we were not going to be given the opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I wanted to comment about to the honourable member for Lyne is that I am not aware of a superannuation fund operated by the ACTU. There is none. What I am aware of is that there are industry funds which have both trade union representatives, and I assume that is what he is objecting to, as well as there being employer representatives in these funds. Mr Deputy Speaker, with your background, you may be able to correct me, but my understanding is that the ACTU has no superannuation fund that it tries to get all trade unionists' funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In listening to all the ranting and raving about choice and flexibility and portability and how good the coalition government is, I think that we just need to restate a few things. In 1983, 40 per cent of males had access to superannuation. In the main, they were in the public service, or they were executives in private enterprise. But ordinary workers did not. It was even worse as far as females were concerned. A miserable 24 per cent were covered by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1795"> superannuation. That is an appalling record that John Howard left as Treasurer in 1983. It was something that the Labor Party was committed to change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I often feel that, given half a chance to succeed, these superannuation reforms by Labor will be, perhaps, one of our best monuments of that period of office. But what happened to that 40 per cent? By 1996, 90 per cent of all males were covered by superannuation and, as far as women were concerned, it was even more dramatic: 24 per cent to 85 per cent. But for those people&mdash;that is, the 60 per cent of males in the population and the 76 per cent of females&mdash;there was not one iota of concern by the coalition when they were in office. Not one scintilla of concern. The coalition were happy for them not to be covered by superannuation and when they come up here with this bill, they cannot even acknowledge the progress that has been made. I think that that progress has been really great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) referred to the history of superannuation in this country and, in fact, the Chifley measure that set up the national welfare fund. All working Australians were required to pay a proportion of their income into the fund. When they got their tax return, it showed the tax that they had paid and the amount they had been levied under the national welfare fund. As he rightly points out, even today, some older pensioners will come up and say to you, `This pension is not a hand&hyphen;out by the government; this is something I contributed to.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Liberals do when they got into office in the 1950s? They butchered it. Firstly, Menzies did away with the separation so that there was no distinction. It was just all shown as one form of taxation in your income tax return. Then he said that there should no longer be a separate national welfare fund; it all should go to consolidated revenue. At the end of the Menzies years there was just a shell. All it was was a bit of legislation with no money in it. That is what happened. This was a fully funded fund. If only it had been allowed to continue. If only it had not been butchered by the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say a little about the RSAs. Of course, it is true that the coalition was obligated to the banks. The honourable member for Lyne, who represents a rural area, should note that these are the very same banks that were chucking out farmers hand over fist. Just recently, on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This Day Tonight,</EMPHASIS> we had an example&mdash;I think Pegasus was the name of the company&mdash;of `a small Australian company specialising in designing brewery apparatus and winning markets in China. An overwhelming majority of its business was in exports. It had been successful, and had built up 60 Australians in that company all using their brain power. And what happened? A bank foreclosed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sort of organisation that the coalition government is indebted to. They are the same banks who are screwing their customers mercilessly with their fees and charges; the same banks who, if they cannot earn a billion or two billion dollars profit each and every year, think they are very unsuccessful. These are the people that the coalition government has rewarded with RSAs. They are saying, `This is competition. We have got to allow the banks into it.' The banks were already into superannuation because of their insurance cross&hyphen;ownership and operations. They had a stakehold in it but, no, they wanted these accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be interesting to listen to the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who represents a Victorian regional seat, explain how he is going to ask young people, if they are lucky enough to get a job when 30 per cent nationally are unemployed, how they are going to exercise their freedom of choice to have their superannuation placed in an RSA. Of course they are not. They are going to go into the fund that the employer tells them to go into. It is absolute hogwash 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1796"> to say that this is freedom of choice. But if they do go into an RSA, are they going to get a healthy return? Is it really going to significantly build up their superannuation entitlements? Of course it is not. You might be getting huge security out of this, but you will be getting minimal returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reject this notion of RSAs. The banks&mdash;the principle beneficiaries of this legislation&mdash;have a responsibility to husband and marshall the savings of the nation. Sure, I accept that we have a savings problem. But let me quote the figures to you. In 1983, when the then Treasurer was John Howard, the amount in superannuation funds was $40 billion. In 1997, that figure is not $60 billion, not $70 billion, not $100 billion, but $350 billion. I was criticised by my colleague the member for Burke for suggesting that, by the year 2000, it would be $500 billion. He suggested I was too conservative. It would be much more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Banks have a responsibility for marshalling the nation's savings. Have they got a really great track record in promoting Australian industry, in funding Australian research, in ensuring that Australian innovation is retained and developed in the country and exported from Australia? Of course they do not. They have a miserable record, otherwise we would not, as a government, have had to plough money into research and development programs that the current government has cut back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you are talking about the battlers, about Mr and Mrs Average and what they want from their superannuation funds, sure, they want their funds to be safe, to be there when they retire. That is why we have a prudential regime with superannuation companies. But they also want to have a job and they want a job for their son or daughter. If you fail to start funding Australian industry, Australian research and development, you are not going to have those jobs; they just will not be there. If you are saying, `Let it rip, it's market forces. Unemployment for young people: 30 per cent&mdash;that's not so bad; if it floats up even higher, that's just market forces,' if you are saying that the institutional infrastructure of Australia, like savings institutions, like the banks we are rewarding overwhelmingly today, have no role to play in that, then there are not going to be those jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not asking that the majority of funds of existing superannuation funds go into developing Australian industry or Australian innovation, but I believe that some ought to. I think some ought to, consistent with trying to manage their responsibility to the people who are putting funds in there. I do not want to get into a debate about whether it should be one per cent or five per cent, but there ought to be some. When they make an annual report, let them report on how they have been doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the banks, it has been a miserable history. Right through the eighties when we implemented banking deregulation, they shovelled money at the top end of town like it was going out of fashion. When the proverbial hit the fan, it was not the top end of town that really paid; it was small business, medium sized business and people with longstanding overdrafts and credit facilities. All of a sudden, with no deterioration in their business, they were called up. Many of them went out of business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The banks did not care. They had a policy of recovering a certain percentage of money. They did not care if they bankrupted people. They got a percentage of what the business was worth. They just went out and did it. I would be interested in hearing from the member for Bendigo what the changes are. Is this not happening any more in Bendigo? I can tell him that it still happens in my electorate. As I said, I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This Day Tonight</EMPHASIS> program. We are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1797"> rewarding the same people who had&mdash;and, frankly, still have&mdash;such a cavalier attitude by putting workers' money in their accounts. We are boosting their amount of savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose this may be a little pedantic but, given this nourished, long held view of the coalition of the importance of retirement savings accounts, I am surprised that there is not one word of how much money is going to go in there. There is not one prediction about how popular this will be. I have read the second reading speech by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), and I could not find one word about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could the person who will sum up this debate tell the people of Australia what the foregone returns will be by people who have put their money in RSAs? For example, if people invest $100 million in RSAs, what will they be earning compared with other industry funds? What will be the difference? What will be the foregone income of these people? If this legislation is passed and if someone signed up for it tomorrow, what will it mean over their working life? The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) made a few remarks that I want to respond to.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You obviously were not watching him because I know you were not here. You might revise that if you saw the tape.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for North Sydney was emphasising the issue of choice. I do not mind choice. What he was saying, as was the member for Lyne, was that the superannuation of itinerant workers and people with small amounts of money was being eaten away by management fees. That was true when the scheme was first introduced. I think it was one of those unintended consequences. What was really unfortunate was that there was no discussion of our legislative amendments which enabled people with amounts of $1,000 to have no management fees attracted to them whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, if this is going to benefit the workers it would have been nice in 1983 if the coalition had stood up for the 60 per cent of males or the 76 per cent of females who did not have superannuation. We ought to be proud that we have increased the coverage from 40 per cent to 90 per cent for males and from 24 per cent to 85 per cent for females.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A degree of compulsion is always needed in terms of savings. The member for Lyne acknowledged that home ownership is most people's way of compulsory saving. You can run some numbers through and show that it is not as cost effective or beneficial as some other forms of saving, but I do not deprecate people&mdash;and I am certainly in that boat&mdash;who try to save significantly through home ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the same with superannuation. We could say to the people of Australia, `You have complete freedom of choice. You can either pocket what you would get in superannuation or you can put it in a fund.' However, if people are raising a family, have young children, and have all sorts of expenses to contemplate, they will never have sufficient money to save, but they will manage on the money they get. That is why it is important that there is an element of compulsion in superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Home ownership is great, but it is not going to be sufficient to provide for retirement. Most people, even pensioners, that I have spoken to would like to see their children or their grandchildren in a much healthier retirement situation than they enjoy, although the pension would always be the safety net for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a national savings problem. We ought to encourage all forms of saving, including encouraging people to save for their retirement via superannuation. As the member for Burke 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1798"> has indicated, the opposition, whilst moving an amendment to this later, as I understand it, is not going to hold up this package of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coalition members talk about choice and flexibility. The real choice they are getting with RSAs is to reward the banks. If the people of Australia think the banks need to be rewarded for their efforts through the 1980s and 1990s, for their profits, or for the way they are increasing their fees and charges on the accounts of punters or even small business, then fair enough. However, I happen to disagree with that perspective very strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real choice people will be getting when they get an RSA is to get a much smaller income. There will be freedom of choice, flexibility and portability, but all on a journey to a much lower return than they would get if they were exercising some other form of superannuation saving.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill 1996 and cognate bills because this is important legislation. It is another election promise fulfilled by the Howard government. The retirement savings accounts are quite different from what the member for Chifley (Mr Price) just elucidated in this chamber. I hope the honourable member will stay here for a little while because I want to respond to some of his comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Retirement investments take a variety of forms. If I were to look around this chamber at the provision that members have made for the day when they leave the work force, I would find that every one of the strategies would be totally different. It takes many forms. Retirement savings accounts are yet another form of investment, but this is a form of investment in which people will have a choice. They will have the choice to decide how their retirement income will be put into reserve for the day when they leave the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to run through some of the forms that people choose for their retirement. In fact, when people start saving for their retirement, they often have a range of investments which they put aside for their future. It may be domestic property; it may be their own home and many Australians have the great Australian dream of owning their own home. That quite obviously has been a form of retirement saving to either buy or build a home for their retirement so that they are in fact secure and have shelter for the future for themselves and their spouse and members of their family when they are growing up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just one method of retirement savings, and superannuation, of course, is another. But that is a choice that should and could be chosen by anyone who decides that that is their best investment. They have the opportunity to make that choice. Other avenues of property investment could be commercial or industrial investment. Some people choose to in fact invest in other forms of real estate, whether it be land or property in buildings. There is also the Australian share market and investing in Australian companies so that the future of Australia in fact does expand and they take a small slice of equity in an Australian company which promotes jobs and in fact reinvests money back into Australia and provides the opportunity for people to also have additional retirement funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The investment funds of a number of companies are available to investors. They can go in with a small entry contribution and they can, over a period of their working life, contribute to investment funds. To hear the member for Chifley in his speech you would think that there is only one acceptable form of retirement investment, and that is superannuation. There are many forms and people will exercise those choices and the idea of saying to people that you must contribute to a superannuation form, it is compulsory for you to contribute to a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1799"> superannuation investment, is the way the Australian Labor Party operates. They say that we know best, but I can tell you that they did not know best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to take you back to the period when Labor thought that they knew all the answers. You had to go into superannuation and you had to do certain things. They thought they knew how to run this economy. When interest rates went from 8 per cent to 23 per cent in the recession we had to have that demonstrated the error of the ways of the Australian Labor Party. They did not know best. They did not know how to manage other people's money. What they did in fact was drive many thousands of people in Australia out of their homes. They lost their homes during the recession we had to have and those homes were part of their retirement and superannuation funds, the retirement for their life after they have left the work force. Thousands of people in Australia during that period lost their homes because the Australian Labor Party thought they knew best. They still think it. They think that they know best and they are saying to you that you must have compulsory superannuation. You cannot exercise any other choice in your retirement savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are offering for people is a whole range of opportunities for their retirement when they leave the work force and I am afraid for the Labor Party to still be persisting with this idea that there has to be compulsory savings. You only have to look back at the track record of the previous government. I think the member for Chifley was berating the banks for their performance during 13 years of Labor Government. They were remarkably silent during that 13 years of office. If they felt there was something wrong, it certainly did not show in their actions and after all of that time the Labor Party took very little action if they thought there was anything so drastically wrong with what the banks were doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there have been problems with superannuation, and particularly for people running small balances in superannuation funds. The three areas of concern for compulsory superannuation were, firstly, the lack of choice, secondly, the small balances and, thirdly, the proliferation of small accounts that people had. We are offering them an opportunity to get away from compulsory superannuation by investing in retirement savings accounts which will be offered by financial institutions. I will go through some of those financial institutions in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To hear the honourable member for Chifley, you would think that the banks were the only ones offering these retirement savings accounts. An RSA institution can be a bank, a building society, a credit union, a life insurance company or a prescribed financial institution that has approval. It certainly opens up the range of organisations offering retirement savings accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every member of this House, this parliament, would have had complaints from people with a part&hyphen;time job who were employed in the work force for a few hours a week and who were compelled to go into the superannuation guarantee contributions under the Labor government's legislation, the superannuation guarantee contributions legislation. When that legislation was introduced, there were no means of protecting small balances in superannuation sums arising from those compulsory contributions. People found that, after a very short time, any contributions that had been deducted from their earnings as a part&hyphen;time worker were eroded by fees and charges. In fact, some balances went into the negative and they ended up owing the superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The charges that were imposed by some of the superannuation funds resulted in many people being disillusioned with superannuation. They could see their contributions not only being reduced but going into the red. The retirement savings accounts offer a capital guarantee. That 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1800"> will have a lot of benefits, and not only for people who want to choose different means for handling their retirement money. The thing that has come to our notice through the member for Chifley, and other members of the former government, is the Labor Party's paranoia about compulsory superannuation payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compulsory superannuation required that a certain percentage of an employee's salary be contributed to superannuation and, of course, people had no choice. They were forced to go into this but people like the freedom of being able to exercise their choice and to have a range of retirement benefits and to not necessarily have all of their retirement package invested in superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen in Australia a number of people taking substantial sums out of their superannuation funds on their retirement. They may have been people who were almost ready to retire but who had a part&hyphen;time job to keep them going for a period and so they looked around for suitable investments for their funds. During the horrible period of the 1980s and early 1990s, under Labor, some of those investments that superannuants made were fairly risky and a lot of people lost their money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was an area then that caused a great deal of trauma for a number of people. Retirement savings accounts open up a whole new area for people who are approaching retirement age. Those who are nearing retirement who wish to perhaps find a safe place to park their retirement money or their superannuation prior to actually getting out of the work force full time could park their money in an RSA prior to retirement and it would be capital guaranteed. It would be of a low risk nature and the RSAs should be more attractive to people under those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard the contribution by members on the other side of the chamber, particularly the member for Chifley. I am disappointed that he did not stay for a little while. Maybe he had some commitments. I think the important thing is to remember that, in all of the investment plans of every person in society, they will all choose different methods of approaching their retirement and how they will take care of their life after they leave the work force. To hinge all of your hopes and aspirations purely and simply onto superannuation, for a lot of people is not necessarily an option. In fact they may wish to secure, as I indicated  earlier, other investments in a whole range of products that might give them greater security than compulsory superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the Retirement Savings Account Bill does offer to people. There is even the opportunity for people with RSA balances, when they reach a limit of $10,000, to be offered a full range of other potential products. That is part of this legislation. They do have flexibility within that retirement savings account whereby they can explore a whole range of other options once it reaches the $10,000 balance. They can look at other investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think back to the time when I had many representations from people who were working part time in the work force and doing a whole range of casual jobs. At the end of the financial year, when checking on their balance in their compulsory superannuation, they found it to be absolutely nil. They had a nil balance in their account. They paid in all of this money and at the end of it all there was nothing there. It particularly affected women in the work force who, on many occasions, were working part time. They found at the end of a period of 12 months part-time work in the work force that in fact they had a nil balance in that account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Retirement savings accounts will provide a capital guaranteed fund, lower fees and another option on retirement for people who are leaving the work force.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned at the lack of political memory. I heard the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) talking about those terrible years of the 1980s and early 1990s. I was in parliament in the years when Malcolm Fraser and John Howard had driven interest rates equally high, when there were bank foreclosures of equal numbers and where they had managed to get inflation up at enormous rates as well. What it comes down to is frankly no difference between the performance of either party. They have both got it wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall some rather churlish remarks made by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) when he was moving an adjournment. He commented that this was the way the Liberal Party was rewarding the banks, and there is an element of the Liberal Party rewarding the banks. However, it is quite clear that the superannuation brought in by the Dawkins-Keating government&mdash;Dawkins being the Treasurer&mdash;was Labor's way of rewarding insurance companies and of trying to set them off against the banks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not need your contribution, I find it facile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that superannuation is not going to be the answer. If you compound inflation at about 6 per cent over the life of most of the superannuants, they will probably have enough money to buy a new Holden Commodore on their retirement. This brings me to what the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) was talking about, other alternatives. One of the great alternatives talked about is the Singapore model. Unfortunately, the Singapore model would not apply in Australia; it could not apply, because we do not have the social cohesion that Singapore has with its monocultural society. In Singapore if you are not Chinese you do not matter. Where you have that enormous social cohesion it works very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Singapore model is modelled on the British model, which does work well, but these are not superannuation funds, they are funded pension funds, as Chifley's scheme was. It was not a superannuation fund, it was a funded pension fund. The situation with the funded pension funds is that they are much easier to administer. Administration costs are much lower because it is done through taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the British scheme has worked very well for Britain, and even Margaret Thatcher did not touch it because it was far and away the biggest contributor to innovation in British industry. Nobody else was funding it. Certainly, the banks in Britain have a history of not funding industry. It was the funded pension funds that were funding all that innovation, as happens in Singapore. Their fund has been a great funder of innovation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has not occurred in Australia. We have $350 billion in funds we are now told by the member for Chifley (Mr Price). It is not a big deal if you look at what they actually do with it because I do not see any evidence that any of the superannuation funds are contributing to the development of Australian industry. They are, by and large, chasing short-term gains with short-term investments. This is why the member for Bendigo correctly said that many of the funds had negative returns. Some people ended up with less money than they had contributed because the funds made some very silly short-term investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is being offered here is a retirement savings account which is capital guaranteed. I believe a lot of people out there, hearing us talk about this, will believe that their money is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1802"> absolutely safe, that their money cannot be lost. Of course, that is not true. There is nothing in this legislation that stops an institution going broke and if it goes broke people will be paid a very small amount. In fact, they may not get anything back at all. They could still lose their money but at least they have a better chance than with the present superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to dwell on what you could do if you had a situation where people just compounded their interest in the bank. Where there were no bank charges&mdash;or very low bank charges as exists in Japan and as used to exist here&mdash;and where there was low inflation, this was a foolproof method. It offered all the benefits of the retirement savings account. It gave people maximum flexibility and was less risky because the banks are governed by all sorts of prudential requirements. It was unlikely, but not impossible, that they would go broke. Certainly, administration costs would be much lower, and it is something that could be looked at in Australia. If we had a situation where a bank was prepared to take money on a compound interest basis and not charge exorbitant charges, people could look at a savings bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People do need an incentive to save because there are always requirements for money, particularly when you are raising a family. To make those savings tax free would be one way of giving an incentive. But to run any institution like that you would need a government owned bank&mdash;and that is not likely to happen, with the urban centralist socialist government of Paul Keating having sold the only bank that we owned and the present urban centralist government of John Howard not being likely to reverse that decision. Those options have been closed off to us and that is a great shame, because it would have provided a source of funding which could have gone to lending for Australian industry development, which is not adequately funded now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to go out and talk to people, particularly small businesses, to find out they simply cannot get the funds for development. I might add that we have seen a situation recently in the ACT where the government was approached by a small business association to fund a youth employment project. I think it was a very good project, but they were not interested because they said it was a Commonwealth responsibility and they did not have the money for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they seem to have found the money lend to an investor&mdash;in fact, apparently to give to an investor&mdash;to build a church in which to marry Japanese couples, the idea being that we are going to make a fortune by flying these people into Australia and marrying them here. It is an absolute nonsense concept. They will not spend much money here, if they come at all. If there was a great return on it, the Japanese would have done it long ago. It is an indictment for the ACT government that they are prepared to fund that, but not to fund anything for youth employment. That is just one example of the sort of nonsense you get when we should be talking about investment in providing a future for ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great things that does provide for people's future is a job. If you have a job, you can make provision; if you have not got a job, it is very hard to get provision of any sort. I was rather amused to hear Gough Whitlam still taking credit for his 25 per cent tariff cut across the board. In the late 1960s and early 1970s there were a lot of British high&hyphen;tech companies coming to Australia and establishing the sorts of industries we needed for the future. What Whitlam did was to cut the ground from under their feet and send them skittling back to Britain. We never did get those high&hyphen;tech industries which, if we had got them at that time, would have made things much better for us now. Even all these years later, Whitlam has never seen the light and never recognised the damage that he did.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1803">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, Whitlam's action was applauded by the then opposition. I have no doubt they would have done the same. That brings me back to a theme I have been hammering in this parliament recently: in reality, there is no difference between those who sit on the government side of the House and the opposition; they are simply factions of the one party. That is why, Mr Deputy Speaker, you are finding increasing acrimony and personal attacks on individuals. It is because there is no difference in substance in what they are promoting and they are reduced to attacking each other. It is a very sad state for the development of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be made clear&mdash;and the government should go to some pains to make it clear to people&mdash;that the capital guarantee does not mean that the investment cannot go bad. I recall the heady days in the 1980s when Rothwells had an absolute top credit rating bestowed on it by all the credit rating people around the world. It was a guaranteed investment which local government could invest in&mdash;and many foolishly did. The real situation was that the Bourke government, on a bank holiday weekend in September 1988, was faced with the knowledge that, if they did not bail out Rothwells, its doors would not open on the Tuesday and the government would be faced with significant costs which would probably have amounted to $150 million. Part of that figure was because Catholic education had all its money invested in Rothwells and the government, which had an obligation to provide education, would have had to bail out Catholic education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most conservative country shires had money invested in Rothwells because it was paying two per cent over the regular rate, which in itself should have been a warning. Bodies like the Activ Foundation had money in Rothwells. Everyone feels obligated to help spastics, so the foundation would have been bailed out. Many others would have come out of the woodwork, and would also have been bailed out. On the other hand, if the government gave the guarantee, they were assured by the auditor and by people who were supposed to know a lot about cash flow that it was simply a cash flow crisis and that Rothwells was very sound.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequently, we found out that in 1987 Rothwells went broke, but in 1987 it declared a large dividend. In 1988 it was still broke and it declared a larger dividend, but the government would have been the last to know. By stepping in there, the government stopped an additional run on the stock exchange. It held up the fund until all the small investors got their money out, and it probably saved about 10,000 jobs. Companies borrowing money from Rothwells were able to restructure their affairs and put their money elsewhere. When history is accurately recorded, it will be seen that the government of the day in Western Australia did a good job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I add that, subsequently, it has been assessed by senior, and obviously knowledgeable, academics that the Burke government left an economic situation in Western Australia second only to that in Queensland, where Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen had left the finances of every government department in an absolutely tip&hyphen;top state. In fact, he had every hollow log stuffed with money. That was the largesse that the subsequent Labor government was able to access, and it made a lot of good propaganda for itself in so doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this bill. It is another option. I think it provides many useful functions. Parking of superannuation pay&hyphen;offs is clearly one of them. It also enables people who are only part&hyphen;time participants, people who have very small contributions, to participate. However, I do not believe it is going to be the answer to the savings this country needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that while every member agrees that we need some sort of compulsion for people to invest in superannuation, some sort of compulsion is also required to get the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1804"> superannuation funds to invest in Australia. There is absolutely no evidence that they are prepared to do this of their own free will.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the three bills that are being considered tonight&mdash;the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill, the Retirement Savings (Consequential Amendments) Bill and the Retirement Savings Accounts Supervisory Levy Bill. I was heartened to hear some of the views of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). This legislation is not a panacea, but it is a good start to broadening our superannuation base, particularly for low&hyphen;income earners, itinerant workers, women casual workers and part&hyphen;time workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is designed to give more certainty to the federal government's retirement incomes policy, most importantly for those people who are approaching retirement. It is part of one of many elements that goes to developing a proper plan for superannuation and income retirement. At the end of the day, it is to provide choice, adequate competition, greater scope and portability for those people who choose to put their money into RSA type accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When looking at the history of superannuation, it is necessary to look as well at the history of the labour market and how there have been variations in the patterns of saving and spending for retirement. In July 1992, when the Labor government introduced the superannuation guarantee charge, it started with the best intentions. At that time the levy was placed at three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was unfortunate that, during the eighties when they took away the tax deductibility status for superannuation, the onus was almost exclusively on the employer, as there were numerous wage trade&hyphen;offs during the Accord which built in superannuation. The levy was at three per cent in 1992; it is now at seven per cent. The target is nine per cent by 2003&hyphen;04 of actual contributions made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose the whole reason for the retirement policy that the previous government put in place and which we are continuing is the ageing demographics of the population. Having a pension system is not sufficient enough to take up the scope of the Commonwealth budget. That is why we are trying to encourage people to plan for their retirement. In this case, it is being legislated for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During that time, as is happening now, there was a superannuation contribution tax of 15 per cent. There was a tax on the trustees running those superannuation funds of 15 per cent. There is also this government's change to income earners over $70,000, which amounts to an additional charge of 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole reason this was clearly identified was that Dr FitzGerald inquired into the level of savings in this country. One of the problems we have as compared with other Western developed countries is that we have very low levels of savings. There certainly is an encouragement that, if you are going to spend, spend on debt, because generally speaking it is a deduction. There is also a proliferation of negative gearing. No wonder we have very low savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the eighties and the nineties there has been a major shift of financial capital from the banks to superannuation. That has been geared principally because of the compulsory superannuation guarantee charge. Today $248 million is in super funds. The vast majority of real money is now sitting in superannuation accounts. Last year there was a growth rate of 8.9 per cent, so it is accelerating. For the year 2001, we are looking at a capital base within our superannuation of $348 billion. So it is a big chunk of money.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1805">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, many life insurance companies and superannuation funds are restricted in their charter when it comes to lending. They are not lending for small business; they are not lending for capital expansion; they are investing in liquid assets, be that in the stock market, in property or overseas. I believe these RSAs will provide another string in the bow for banks which will be able to compete in this market. More importantly, capital going into RSAs in banks will be on balance sheets and will be used for future lending facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the changing work force. The reason we need another avenue is that there is an increasing amount of casual work and part&hyphen;time work. People no longer have one job in their life time. The statistics show that there will be four career changes in an average working career of someone now entering the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Sawford interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ6">Mr ANTHONY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That statistic has been around for a number of years under your government. What is needed is portability because, when people move from one career to a different career, they have to have a superannuation scheme that goes with them. That is why I think the RSA scheme is very good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the latest ABS statistics. Over the December quarter, there was an increase in jobs. The principal amount of those jobs created&mdash;and this is not the best outcome&mdash;is in part&hyphen;time and casual work. All of those people need portability in their superannuation. As mentioned before, a lot of these people have small superannuation accounts with many different providers because of the many different jobs that they have had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also mentioned that we have seen a shift in capital within the financial institutions. Capital is going from the banks to superannuation funds. We are seeing a blurring in financial markets. For example, Colonial, which was a super fund, took over the State Bank. There is a blurring there. We are seeing a demutualisation with National Mutual. No doubt we will see a demutualisation, with shareholder approval, of AMP. We have seen the merger of a bank with an insurance company: the Queensland Bank with Metway and Suncorp in Queensland. Financial institutions are evolving to the deregulated market place. Therefore, it is necessary to provide adequate products for Australians to access for their super.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is this about, this retirement savings account? It is a vehicle whereby people can invest in a portable superannuation which does not have a trust structure. In the past, or currently if you are with a life company or a super company, it had to be within a trust structure. This obviously is going to provide a vehicle where it will be capital guaranteed, where it will be portable, where it will be owned by the members and where there are still preservation rights. It is particularly important, as I mentioned before, for people who are low income workers with spouses. At a time when we are having a lot of marriage breakdowns, up to 40 per cent, when those relationships break up there should be some avenue for the spouse, or whatever the partner is, to have some type of superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this particular policy, there is one area which has not been raised tonight which I think is very prudent. When the bill is passed, the new arrangements under superannuation guarantee will mean that a single income family will be able to direct some of their superannuation, up to an 18 per cent rebate or equivalent of $3,000 per spouse, to their spouse if they have got an income level under $10,800. What it is doing is providing a nest egg for that other partner. So, if there is a break&hyphen;up in a relationship, at least that person has something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that is very positive in this is that it is a low cost product; it does not cost a lot. As many members have mentioned before, during the 1980s and during the 1990s a lot 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1806"> of the superannuation contributions made were eaten up by management fees, by transaction fees, not to mention bank charges, where their actual returns were negative. When you look at the actual returns in 1993&hyphen;94 and 1994&hyphen;95, they did not even perform to an indexed fund. It is only in the last couple of years that we have actually seen an increase in superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a low risk product. As has been mentioned, it is capital guaranteed. When a lot of people put their funds in what they thought were guaranteed funds during the 1980s, they lost a lot of money. There are no fees, or very limited fees. If the amount does drop under $1,000&mdash;there is about $400 million in funds now which have very small amounts&mdash;there is a guarantee that the actual amount contributed will not fall below that starting point through accumulation of fees or charges. I think that is very positive, because a lot of people have lost faith in superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add, and it is not unique to this government, that I think it is terribly important that we maintain stability within superannuation so that we do not see all these countless changes, because it just takes away the incentive and it makes it very difficult for people to plan for their retirement, which in most cases is the most important part of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing is that it is going to provide a one&hyphen;stop shop. I know it is a bit of a buzz word used these days but, if you are going into a financial institution or you are going into a bank, you will also be able to have some of your super there as well as your own deposit system. Likewise, you will be able to maintain that arrangement now with current life companies or superannuation companies. As I mentioned, the big plus, though, is for people on low incomes, for spouses, for itinerant workers, for people who are not wealthy, to have this portability. It should be supported by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How is it going to be regulated? One of the problems in the 1980s, when we had the deregulation juggernaut that sort of smashed through the door when we floated the dollar, was that there was a wildcat ride. Of course, we had the huge increase in interest rates, we had the boom&hyphen;bust of the share market, and part of this was because there were no prudential controls put into place to monitor the excesses of the 1980s. That is why it is very important, if you are going to introduce new financial legislation, to make sure you have prudential controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area which has been thought out well is the functional supervisory controls for this RSA account. The prudential framework has existed since 1957, when the Banking Act was brought down under the auspices of the Reserve Bank. That has obviously been to regulate the major banks, the major deposit base and the lending institutions. Then later on we had the build&hyphen;up of building societies and credit unions. They basically came under state supervision. Then we have had the big juggernauts which are the old life insurance companies, the most notable being AMP, Bankers Trust and MLC, just to name a few. Those particular areas will be covered, not by a prudential framework, because they cannot, but, in addition, by the ISC, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, which will supervise those statutory funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area, too, is what happens when you develop these funds and I reach retirement age? How am I going to access them? It is important that people understand that if they are going to go into an RSA, if it is with a bank, a credit union or a building society, they cannot just take funds out like a pension or annuity because such things are not provided. They are not provided because those institutions do not have what is called `mortality risk'. They are not in the business of providing ongoing payment. So, if you go to a bank or one of those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1807"> institutions, it is either going to have to be an allocated pension or a lump sum. If you are with a life insurance company, it will remain as a pension or an annuity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a positive element. In conclusion, it is all about offering more flexibility and better returns for those people who cannot afford more complicated or better financial advice with superannuation funds. It offers a capital guarantee. It is not going to provide incredible returns but at the moment the problem is that there is a real desire by financial institutions to race into the top quartile of performances where they have to take on greater risk to get the greater reward. They take on greater risk and, as history has proven time and time again, the potential for down years is significant. My concern, particularly with what is now quite a heated stock market, is that we could well see some other calamities happening in the next couple of years, particularly with some of those life companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing with this is that there is a recognition that the work force is changing. We have not all got security of tenure now. We have not got full&hyphen;time jobs. People are changing; they are going to have to change, and they need that portability. The whole population is getting older. Like most western democracies, we need to have a proper savings and retirement plan. That is what this particular scheme does. I believe that it is a worthy addition to our retirement incomes policy. It is an election promise fulfilled and it should have the bipartisan support of this parliament because it is a good thing. It is also going to start to reduce some of the monopoly of capital that is heavily concentrated now in super funds. As I mentioned before, most of those super funds do not have the provision to lend to the small businesses because of their restrictions. If you have part of superannuation with the bank, you can start to build up that capital base so that they can be back in the business of lending as they should be, not just to the home mortgage market, but to small businesses at competitive rates. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 February 1996, Mr Don Mercer, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, addressed a meeting of the Australian Superannuation Funds Association, ASFA. Mr Mercer was arguing the case that banks should be allowed to enter the superannuation market on two grounds, those being: improving the levels of national savings; and on the basis of non&hyphen;discrimination against the banks. He observed:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems surprising that, in an era when government policies have consciously sought to expand the range of choice available to individuals in other fields . . . the government has sponsored such a dramatic narrowing in the range of choice available to individuals as to the institutions with which they save.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Retirement Savings Accounts Bill 1996 and the two associated bills being debated cognately are about the widening of consumer choice and improving the level of competition within the superannuation sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill allows for banks, life insurance companies, credit unions and building societies to offer their customers an alternative to superannuation, in providing for themselves in retirement. In 1986, the then Treasurer, Mr Paul Keating, sold the superannuation guarantee charge to the public as the answer to Australia's national savings problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggested in this place in September 1995 that that scheme could not guarantee increased national savings. Rather, I submitted then that superannuation, as it was constituted, would become a mere substitute for other forms of domestic savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mercer in his address to ASFA, some 12 months ago, confirmed my opinion when he said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1808">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1986 when award superannuation began to be extended through the work force, the household savings ratio has actually declined from around seven per cent to an average of 3.3 per cent in the 1994&hyphen;95 financial year, and to 3.6 per cent in the September quarter 1995.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He continued by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The household savings ratio has actually dropped by about 1.5 percentage points since the superannuation guarantee scheme formally commenced in the September quarter 1992.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Australians have shown themselves to be poor savers. One Australian journalist went so far as to describe Australia as a nation of financial delinquents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">IPA Review</EMPHASIS> in edition number 49/2 1996 summed this up very succinctly. It recorded that as a result of Australia's appalling record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to import capital, equivalent to five per cent of GDP, just to provide the investment necessary to manage the lacklustre growth of the past decade or so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly, the policies of past governments have not been successful in reversing the trend of diminishing household savings. As a result, the current generation of fully employed Australians is being asked to pay for the retirement of two generations. This is unsustainable in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financial impact statement accompanying the bill and in the explanatory memorandum suggest that the introduction of RSAs will have a negligible impact on revenue in the short term. However, if the RSA/superannuation mix does not lead to an increase in national savings, the impact on future revenue will be much more substantial, of course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An analysis of the superannuation market by MJR Consultants revealed that as at March 1996 the public sector held between $80 billion and $100 billion in unfunded liability, most of which is a liability of the federal government. This figure will continue to burgeon and will place a massive drain on future government revenue. It is yet another reason to support the introduction of alternative savings schemes paid for in full by individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Retirement Income Stream Association, ARISA, has argued that there is a lack of integration between our retirement income and social security policy. So while the government should be commended on its initiative on retirement savings accounts, the RSAs, it should be remembered that the introduction of RSAs alone will not solve the problems that have arisen because of this lack of integration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> pointed out on 3 August 1997 that without an interconnection between social security and the superannuation systems the compulsory savings regime will continue to have little impact in reducing the reliance on a taxpayer funded retirement. Many argue that means testing acts as a disincentive to savings by allowing individuals to access their superannuation contributions at age 55 and then claim the age pension at a later date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ARISA asserts that if the government fails to reintegrate the social security and retirement income policies, the age pension and other related costs will continue to escalate and place pressure on future budgets. It has become apparent that the emphasis on increasing national savings through superannuation, to the exclusion of all other forms of savings, is not producing the goods that Mr Keating had fallaciously claimed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Michael J. Rice, the Managing Director of MJR Consultants, has said that, while consumers are starting to accept that superannuation is a part of their overall pay, they want a greater say in its management. RSAs will offer an alternative investment option for those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1809"> who are not convinced of the benefits of superannuation but who are not great risk takers. RSAs should also appeal to those who are not likely to benefit in full from superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The retirement savings accounts will remain with the owners, regardless of for whom, or when, they choose to work. This will be of particular benefit to many women, and casual and part&hyphen;time workers. As Mr Mercer went on to outline in his address to ASFA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current exclusive emphasis on superannuation imposes a nexus between employment and access to the preferential tax treatment which is exclusively enjoyed by superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Remember that he said that back in 1996. He also commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This in turn disadvantages women, and others whose labour market participation differs from those for whom superannuation schemes were originally intended.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a provision in the legislation for the transfer of funds out of retirement savings accounts at any time. This flexibility will advantage those who require a greater accessibility to their funds than is accommodated under superannuation arrangements as presently constituted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flip side of this increased flexibility is that RSAs will, in all probability, yield lower returns than most superannuation funds. But I believe the benefits of the proposed RSAs outweigh the prospect of lower returns for some who select that particular alternative as an act of free choice. An individual can decide to opt for a superannuation plan that cannot be accessed for years to come but that will produce, of course, a higher return. Alternatively, they can choose to open an RSA, knowing that the funds are available for limited use if required, and that they will face lower fees, but that the RSA is low yielding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">MLC Business and Trustee Superannuation suggested in their presentation at the 1996 superannuation summit that RSAs and superannuation will end up working in tandem with each other, and that is a most likely outcome. They suggested then that existing fund managers may be happy for the banks to take on their small account balance members, but they will try to recapture these accounts once they have started to grow. The National Commission of Audit has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Urgent action is needed to moderate community expectations of government assistance, increase incentives for self reliance in old age and more equitably share the cost of age&hyphen;related services funded by government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is to be hoped that the introduction of retirement savings accounts will see an increase in the number of people taking full responsibility for their own retirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 15 in the explanatory memorandum outlines that an RSA must be maintained for one or more `primary purposes'. Examples of a primary purpose include retirement, attainment of the prescribed age and, heaven forbid, death&mdash;which is inevitable. In the latter case, the benefit is paid to the legal personal representative and/or the holder's dependants. That is a most important inclusion in the bill. It makes clear that, while an individual can access a portion of the funds for ancillary purposes, an RSA is to be preserved essentially for retirement income purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is right to make this provision. It is right to remind all Australians that a fully government funded old age pension will be reserved only for those in real need. In January of this year the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reported the results of the latest RetireInvest survey of high income earners. It found that `while respondents expressed a desire for security and lifestyle when retired, this was not a strong impetus for goal setting.' It appears that the message about self&hyphen;funded retirement has just not been getting through.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1810">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to suggest that RSAs will contribute to an increase in savings for retirement purposes by offering tax incentives to those outside the work force or to those who have interrupted working lives. However, the coalition needs to be reminded against viewing RSAs through rose&hyphen;coloured glasses. Consistent low levels of national savings have proven to be a millstone around the neck of recent Australian governments. This initiative is unlikely to have any significant impact on savings until the bigger issue of our taxation system is reviewed. I repeat what I and many others have asserted in this place and elsewhere in the past: the current tax arrangements are overly complex, expensive and onerous to comply with. They amount to a very substantial set of disincentives to voluntary savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opening up of the superannuation industry to a greater number of players is not going to see a quick fix to our national savings problem. Until the government embraces a thorough overhaul of the tax regime, initiatives like this one will meet with only limited success. The government has described RSAs as being simple, low cost, and low risk. They will be capital guaranteed and will be protected against any downward adjustment to the value of investments, ostensibly underwriting individual accounts or by negative investment returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, a number of senior industry professionals have expressed concern over the decision to allow awards and workplace agreements to offer consumers a choice of up to five funds. They perceive that this will be expensive and difficult to manage. They also suggest that this arrangement is inappropriate for members who will gravitate towards risk free but poorly performing investments, and that this needs to be addressed if the concept of the RSA is to be successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's decision to allow banks and other financial institutions to compete with the superannuation industry participants could have a positive impact on small business. As Mr Mercer, in his ASFA address postulated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Life offices and superannuation funds typically invest upwards of 70 per cent of their assets in the securities of governments and medium&hyphen;large corporations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On average, less than 9 per cent of life offices' and superannuation funds' financial assets are held as wholesale deposits in the banking system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Mercer predicted that it is unlikely that superannuation funds will develop either the expertise or the infrastructure that is necessary to support lending to small business in the short term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nor am I suggesting that the introduction of RSAs will solve the plethora of challenges facing the small business community. They simply will not. Every <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> small business index produced since August 1996 shows that this sector continues to trade under recession&hyphen;like conditions, despite the fact that the economy is on track for solid growth of something like 3.5 per cent during 1996&hyphen;97. However, banks remain the major creditors to small businesses. The introduction of RSAs may, therefore, well see an increase in the availability of finance for small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government delivers on its election promise of reducing the compliance burden for small business by 50 per cent, and if it comes up with meaningful industrial relations reform, one could expect the improved availability of finance to be of real benefit to small businesses. The spill&hyphen;over effect of that, of course, would be on the wider economy and it would be significant indeed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1811">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of retirement savings accounts is a sensible initiative, but it will not see the end of the expectation that many Australians have of fully funded government pensions. The government's aged care policy makes it clear that those who can afford to provide for their care in the nursing home will be expected to do so. The coalition needs to be equally emphatic in developing policy that promotes self&hyphen;funded retirement. It is fair and reasonable to expect that people remain financially independent for as long as possible. By opening up the superannuation market, the government has made a feasible step down that path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RSAs will encourage greater freedom of choice as well as increased competition between funds. This proposed facility seeks to improve equity for low-income earners and allow those not in the conventional work force to access a retirement savings fund. Most analysts agree that the introduction of RSAs will see casualties both in the existing superannuation industry and in some of the new RSA providers. But most admit that increased competition will result in initiative designed to reduce costs as well as the introduction of new services and should therefore be supported.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOPA Australia is shocked to learn of the resignation of Dr Rob Liddell from the position of Director, Office of Aviation Medicine, Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Dr Liddell, the longest serving manager within CASA, is the very type of person CASA can ill afford to lose. As the administrator of aviation medical policy he has shown qualities that have stood him apart from the general tone of CASA's policy making mechanism. Dr Liddell brought a fresh approach to the Aviation Medicine Branch, no doubt in no small part due to his having worked as a line pilot in the airline industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">His progressive philosophy has perhaps best been demonstrated by his policy towards pilots who have had coronary artery disease treated by bypass surgery. These pilots would in days past have been barred from further flying activities, but now they may be recertified fit to fly providing they pass certain medical criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Liddell has at all times been approachable to pilots and medical examiners alike, but always conscious of his obligation to the safety of the travelling public. He is open to arguments, and open to persuasion, provided the evidence be put logically. In short, he has approached his job in an open and forthright manner. Whilst AOPA does not always agree with the decisions made by Dr Liddell, he is respected by this Association for his integrity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter of resignation reveals a deep crisis within CASA which likely goes far beyond the confines of the Office of Aviation Medicine. AOPA considers it a matter of extreme urgency , in the interest of the safety of aviation in this country, that the matters raised by Dr Liddell be addressed without delay. AOPA similarly, urges you, Minister, to use your influence to reverse Dr Liddell's decision to resign. If there are to be resignations, those who have brought about the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1815"> crisis described by Dr Liddell should be leaving not the likes of Dr Liddell.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) See response to 1(d) above for the text of the letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Dr Liddell's letter of resignation to Mr Keith was dated 15 November 1996 and was hand delivered to Mr Keith's office at 9.15 am on Monday 18 November 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) CASA has no record of any formal communication between AOPA and Dr Liddell since August 1996. I am not privy to private communications and am unable to answer this part of the question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) As indicated in my joint statement with the Governor of the Reserve Bank on 14 August 1996, the Government strongly supports the monetary policy framework which requires the Board of the Reserve Bank to set official interest rates with the objectives prescribed in the Reserve Bank's legislation. The Government has welcomed the three reductions in official interest rates which occurred in the second half of 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The automatic imposition of additional charges for late payment is a response, by way of legislation, aimed at encouraging payment of taxation debts by the due date. The additional charges also deny late payers an advantage over those who do pay on time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some taxes, an additional interest component operates to compensate the revenue for the loss suffered during the period the amounts were outstanding. This interest may be compared to what is acceptable commercial practice for use of funds 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1817"> and it is calculated on a base using the thirteen week Treasury Note rate of interest. (Hence, changes in market interest rates are reflected in the additional interest rate penalty, albeit with a lag.)</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. Telstra does advertise discounts applicable to local telephone calls.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) All States have been included in the advertising.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra has promoted plans in a variety of ways (see answer to question 2).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Apart from the War Cemeteries in Australia and Papua New Guinea, the only historic wartime sites for which my Department, through the Office of Australian War Graves, is responsible are certain sites of very limited extent in which have been erected Australian Battle Exploit Memorials.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since establishment of the war cemeteries on Gallipoli in the 1920s the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has taken the view that the battlefield should be allowed to remain in its natural state and that no attempt should be made to preserve or reconstruct the wartime earth works. That approach was adopted in respectful recognition of the blood that has been shed on those battlefields and the many symbols of tragedy that the earth contains.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1823">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Department of Defence compulsorily acquired 25 properties in the vicinity of the Land Warfare Centre at Canungra in 1971. The property previously known as Killarney Glen was one of those acquired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The land was acquired from Mr P M Fitzgerald.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) It is understood that family members occasionally live on the property. Defence has agreed to allow Mr P M Fitzgerald to continue to occupy the area referred to as Killarney Glen for as long as he has a personal need for the property. This arrangement is not transferable to other members of his family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Defence has recently constructed additional training ranges to the north of the area in question. The area which was Killarney Glen is now  designated as part of the buffer zone surrounding the new range areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Except for the administration and accommodation area, and a small area of about fifteen hundred square metres in the south east sector of the training area, all of the Land Warfare Centre, including the area in question, is currently listed on the Register of the National Estate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) In November 1996, the Australian Heritage Commission advised Defence of the intention to separately list the area described as the Back Creek Landscape and sought comment as appropriate. Defence indicated that it had no objection to the proposed listing but did seek to clarify the incorrect inference that Killarney Glen and Land Warfare Centre were two separate properties. The Heritage Commission has now indicated its agreement with the Defence position. This new listing will result in a segment of Land Warfare Centre appearing in two separate listings in the Register of the National Estate.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
