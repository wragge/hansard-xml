<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill responds to the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v. Teoh (1995) 183 CLR 273, which was handed down on 7 April 1995. In that decision, the court found that, by entering into a treaty, the Australian government creates a `legitimate expectation' in administrative law that the executive government and its agencies will act in accordance with the terms of the treaty, even where those terms have not been incorporated into Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The court also said that, where a decision maker intends to act inconsistently with a treaty, procedural fairness required that the person affected by the decision be given notice and an adequate opportunity to put arguments on the point. If not, the decision could be set aside on the grounds of unfairness. The High Court made it clear that such an expectation cannot arise where there is either a statutory or executive indication to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court's decision gave treaties an effect in Australian law which they did not previously have. The government is firmly of the view that this development is not consistent with the proper role of parliament in implementing treaties in Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a longstanding principle that the provisions of a treaty to which Australia is a party do not form part of Australian law unless
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those provisions have been validly incorporated. Under the Australian Constitution, the executive government has the power to make Australia a party to a treaty. It is for Australian parliaments, however, to change Australian law to implement treaty obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons, on 25 February 1997 the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and I made a joint statement which set aside legitimate expectations arising out of entry into treaties. This was a clear expression by the executive government of the Commonwealth of a contrary intention referred to by the majority of the High Court in the Teoh case. The joint statement of 25 February 1997 replaced a joint statement which was made by the previous government on 10 May 1995. However, the 10 May 1995 joint statement continues to apply to decisions made between the date of that statement and 25 February 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 25 February, we also announced that legislation would be introduced into the parliament to displace the legitimate expectation in administrative law which would otherwise arise out of the entry into treaties. This bill fulfils that undertaking. It is a clear statutory indication to the contrary as discussed by the High Court in the Teoh case. It gives this parliament a role in restoring the effect of treaties in Australian law to that they had prior to the High Court's decision in the Teoh case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In passing this legislation, the parliament also will be reasserting its proper role in changing Australian law to implement treaties. Indeed, the bill complements the treaty reforms this government initiated on coming into office. One of the principal aims of those reforms was to enhance the role of parliament in scrutinising treaty action by the executive government. Those reforms included the tabling of treaties in parliament prior to the government taking action to fully become a party to a treaty, the preparation and tabling of national interest analyses for each treaty to which it is proposed Australia become a party and the establishment of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to examine treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures giving the parliament a proper role in the treaty making process could
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5546"> have been introduced by the previous government. However, it was too intent on keeping parliament in the dark about treaties. This veil of secrecy now has been lifted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the terms of the bill itself. The bill will restore the situation which existed before the Teoh case. That is, if there are to be changes to procedural or substantive rights in Australian law resulting from adherence to a treaty, they will result from parliamentary and not executive action. Indeed, this proper role of Commonwealth, state and territory legislatures is emphasised in the sixth paragraph of the preamble to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 5 of the bill gives effect to the statement by the majority of the High Court that a legitimate expectation arising out of entry into a treaty by Australia can be displaced by executive or legislative action. Clause 5 provides that no legitimate expectation providing a basis at law for challenging an administrative decision can arise out of the fact that Australia is bound by an international instrument or the fact that an enactment produces or refers to such an instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The term `international instrument' is defined in clause 4 and covers, amongst other types of instruments, treaties and conventions. To fall within the definition, the instrument must be binding at international law. The definition also covers parts of such instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terms `administrative decision' and `enactment' are also defined in clause 4. The act will apply to administrative decisions made after it enters into force. However, the term `administrative decision' extends to an administrative decision reviewing or determining an appeal in respect of a decision made before the commencement of the legislation. The 25 February 1997 joint statement will continue to apply to decisions made between 25 February 1997 and the date of entry into force of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unclear from the decision of the High Court in Teoh's case whether state and territory administrative decisions may be the subject of legitimate expectations arising out of treaties. This uncertainty could not be allowed to remain. Therefore, the bill is
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expressed to extend to state and territory decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since ratification of a treaty is a Commonwealth executive action, it is entirely appropriate for the Commonwealth to legislate to control the effect of that action in Australian domestic law generally. The states and territories all support Commonwealth legislation on this issue. However, they differ in their views on whether the Commonwealth legislation should be applied to state and territory decisions. Therefore, clause 6 of the bill contains a roll-back provision. This excludes the operation of the bill in relation to state or territory administrative decisions where the relevant state or territory legislature passes, or has passed, legislation having the same or similar effect as this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that it will be open to a state or territory to have its own legislation of similar effect. South Australia enacted such legislation in 1995. Therefore, the bill will have no application to state administrative decisions in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nor does the bill prevent any state which wishes to do so from passing a law or taking its own executive actions in relation to treaties accepted by Australia which might themselves create a legitimate expectation. In that case, the legitimate expectation would flow from state law and not the Commonwealth executive act of ratification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 7 puts it beyond doubt that parliament is not affecting the way in which treaties may otherwise have relevance in Australian law. Let me mention a number of existing uses covered by clause 7.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, this bill will not affect the operation of treaty provisions which have been incorporated into Australian law. For example, it does not affect the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which are given the force of law by the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1967.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the bill will not affect the operation of an act which provides for the redress of grievances in respect of alleged breaches of international instruments to which Australia is a party. For example, the bill does not affect the operation of procedures available
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5547"> under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the bill does not affect the operation of legislation which provides that compliance with an international instrument is a relevant consideration in making an administrative decision. For example, under the air navigation regulations, compliance with Australia's bilateral air services agreements is a relevant consideration in making various decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the bill does not make compliance with an international instrument an irrelevant consideration in making an administrative decision where that would otherwise be consistent with the scope and object of the particular statutory provision. Fifthly, the bill will not affect the use by courts of international law in the form of treaties in the interpretation of statutes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, it will not affect their use of international law as a source of guidance for the development of the common law. This use of treaties as one source for the development of the common law is to be distinguished from the High Court's finding that treaties gave rise to legitimate expectations in administrative law. It is the legitimate expectation aspect of the Teoh decision with which this government and the previous government disagreed. That is the aspect addressed by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 25 February 1997, I stated that I looked forward to continuation of bipartisan support on this issue. The strength of feeling which the opposition, when in government, demonstrated on this issue was no more evident than in the speech given by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) to the Mason and Beyond conference in September 1995. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My lack of enthusiasm for Teoh is not especially a function of my lack of appreciation of how it has narrowed the gap between international and domestic law: rather it is a function of my belief that Teoh creates a decision-making environment that is unworkable in practice, and that it goes further than the court was compelled to go by any legal principle, or should have gone, in upsetting the present balance between Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. The pre-Teoh balance was a delicate one, to be sure, but nonetheless one perfectly attractive in theory and workable in practice.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There can be no doubt that those words are his own. They encapsulate the reasons why this legislation is necessary in order to restore the proper role of this parliament in the implementation of treaties. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The coalition went into the 1996 election with a strong policy commitment to bring about an up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date and workable copyright law, and specifically to legislate to recognise properly the moral rights of authors and artists. The comprehensive protection of moral rights of authors and artists is something for which Australia's creators have been agitating during the last few years. Provision for this is the single most important reform in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also reform the law of ownership of copyright in the works of employed journalists and the law governing importation of goods with copyright labelling or packaging, and introduce much needed streamlining or modernising of the operation of some areas of the act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Moral rights for authors, artists and film directors and producers</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, which is the main international convention on copyright and of which Australia and 124 other countries are members, `moral rights' are:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the right of an author or artist to be identified with his or her work&mdash;known as the right of attribution; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the right to object to alteration or other derogatory treatment of the work that would
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5548"> be prejudicial to the author's or artist's honour or reputation&mdash;known as the right of integrity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The rights apply to literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works and to films, but not to sound recordings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Personal honour and reputation are already protected by the laws of defamation. The law of passing off enables professional authors and artists to prevent another person representing himself or herself as the creator of their business output, including copyright works. The provisions in the Trade Practices Act against misleading or deceptive conduct could also be invoked by authors and artists. Some provisions in the Copyright Act already protect specific aspects of moral rights&mdash;for example, the duty to refrain from falsely attributing a work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this fragmentary and incomplete coverage by Australian law of the Berne convention moral rights obligations has been increasingly criticised. Among other common law countries that had a similar approach to moral rights protections, the United Kingdom and Canada introduced improved moral rights legislation in 1988, and New Zealand largely adopted the UK model in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill that I am now presenting honours this government's 1996 election policy commitment to the introduction of comprehensive moral rights and does so by reference to the international standards set by the Berne convention. It is not just fulfilling international obligations; it is also acknowledging the great importance of ensuring respect for the integrity of creative endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right of attribution will be an important advance for authors, artists and film producers and directors, because they have no comprehensive right beyond any relevant contract to require attribution. The right to take action against false attribution is essentially a consolidation of existing provisions in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right of integrity will provide a more certain and uniform level of protection than the laws of defamation, which vary from state to state or territory, and will, consistently with the Berne convention, last as long as copyright in the work; that is, life of the creator
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> plus 50 years or, in the case of films, 50 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises the concerns of users of copyright&mdash;such as broadcasters, advertising agencies, filmmakers and newspaper publishers&mdash;that these rights will unduly hamper their existing practices. It is understandable that they fear use of moral rights by creators as an additional form of leverage to extract higher returns for the use of creators' works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if a user of a work respects the rights of the creator&mdash;that is, acknowledges, where reasonable, the authorship of the work and, where reasonable, avoids treatment that is prejudicial to the reputation of the author&mdash;then the user does not owe the author anything and does not need the author's permission in making the intended use of the work. In contrast, a user of one of the copyright economic rights&mdash;such as, the right to copy, to publish, to broadcast&mdash;must always have the copyright owner's permission, express or implied, unless the use comes within a statutory exception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In determining whether non&hyphen;attribution of authorship of a work is an infringement of moral rights, a court will have to consider whether the omission was reasonable in the circumstances. Reasonableness will depend on a number of relevant factors that must be taken into account; notably, the nature of the work, industry practice and whether the creator was an employee. Whether alteration of or dealing with a work infringes the right of integrity will also be subject to a similar test of reasonableness based on relevant criteria. Further, there will be no infringement of moral rights by a particular act or omission if it was consented to by the creator or if it was covered by a waiver by the creator of one or more of their rights for the work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, it should be emphasised that the introduction of moral rights, in particular the right of integrity, is not intended to impede or adversely affect the time&hyphen;honoured practices of parody and burlesque. The moral right of integrity is not intended to stifle satire, spoof or lampoon any more than does the existing law of defamation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5549">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Experience in other countries suggests&mdash;and the government envisages&mdash;that enforcement of moral rights through the courts will be an exceptional occurrence. The main impact of the new legislation will, it is hoped, be to build upon good existing industry practice and, where necessary, to raise awareness in an educative way of the need to respect the creativity of authors and artists. In those exceptional cases in which a creator feels forced to take action, courts will have the discretion to order a range of remedies, including damages, injunctions, publication of apology or reversing infringing treatment of a work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Journalists' copyright</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A general rule under the Copyright Act is that copyright in works created in the course of employment belongs to the employer, who has engaged and paid the employees to create the works. However, there has long been an exception in the case of employed newspaper journalists in regard to use of their works other than for the purpose for which they have been employed; that is, newspaper publication. Thus, those journalists have copyright for the purpose of book publication and photocopying of their articles, pictures or cartoons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the impact of new technology, the way that the act divides copyright between the publishers and employed journalists has become out of date. In regard to electronic uses of the employees' works&mdash;for example, selling of on&hyphen;line access to the public&mdash;the government accepts that the publishers' copyright in their employees' creations should now extend to electronic rights, and the bill provides for this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the book rights now held by employed journalists in their articles and pictures will stay with them. The existing right of the employed journalists to authorise photocopying of their articles, most notably in press cuttings services, will also remain with them. While the publishers have indicated that they do not oppose this, they have been concerned at the possibility that photocopying could impact on the circulation of their publications.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not satisfied that photocopying by press cuttings services up to now has had such an impact. Nevertheless, the government sees justification in giving publishers a right of objection to the making of photocopies of more than 15 per cent of a newspaper or magazine other than those pages containing full&hyphen;page advertisements. Where the copies are being made for several or many clients, as is done by press cuttings services, the right to object in the bill will operate in respect of any one client, not all clients in aggregate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Copyright packaging and labelling of imported goods</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1988 a report by the Copyright Law Review Committee recommended to the then government that copyright in packaging or labelling of imported goods should not be able to be used to control distribution of the goods. Copyright control over importation of copyright items&mdash;such as CDs, books and software&mdash;is a controversial matter, and the government is currently reviewing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, control of importation of non&hyphen;copyright items, such as bottles of liquor, by exercise of the copyright in the label is an inappropriate restraint of legitimate trade and, as recommended by the CLRC, it should be ended. This bill will implement this clearly desirable and long overdue reform. This change will not, however, relax existing controls over importation of goods with labelling or packaging that consists of copyright materials made without the consent of the copyright owner in the country of manufacture.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Streamlining and rationalising other areas of the existing act </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other provisions in the bill, while of a more technical machinery nature, introduce much needed streamlining or modernising of the operation of areas of the act, including:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the provisions allowing governments to copy copyright material, subject to providing equitable remuneration to copyright owners;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the provisions allowing institutions serving persons with print or intellectual disabilities to make special editions of works to help
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5550"> those persons to have access to copyright materials;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the provisions allowing educational institutions to copy materials for teaching;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the provisions establishing the Copyright Tribunal;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the provisions governing the remedies that may be awarded by the courts for copyright infringement; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the provisions for border interception of infringing imported copyright material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes some formal amendments such as updating the references to broadcasting legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important bill for copyright creators because it delivers to them comprehensive moral rights which are so important in reaffirming respect for the creative role of authors, artists, film directors and producers. It is also important to copyright owners in facilitating payment to them for uses of their works under various statutory licences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is, at the same time, important for large institutional users of copyright, not just governments but all the educational institutions, in streamlining the procedures for them to account to copyright owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill includes important changes to ownership of copyright in works of employed journalists which recognise the impact of new communications technology on the delivery of newspapers and magazines. In that regard, further changes to copyright in the new communications networks are likely after the government has considered the new international copyright treaties concluded at a diplomatic conference in Geneva last December.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This bill includes a micro&hyphen;economic reform in lifting copyright control over distribution of imported goods with copyright packaging or labelling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, this bill is a very substantial first instalment of the government's commitment to bringing about an up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date and workable Copyright Act. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill introduces a statutory exemption for the Austudy and Abstudy schemes from the operation of the marital status discrimination provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, the Austudy and Abstudy schemes discriminate on the basis of marital status in two key ways. Firstly, there are differences in the way legally married students are treated as compared with students in de facto relationships. Secondly, there are differences in the way legally married students are treated in comparison with single students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of these differences go to the broader issue of the assumptions of dependency which underpin Commonwealth allowances generally. Rates of allowance and the income and assets tests, including those applied to receipt of rent assistance, are based on the assumptions which also underpin other Commonwealth allowances that a person with a partner has access to the financial means of their partner to meet their combined costs, and a single person who is independent of parental assistance does not have the opportunity to share costs for accommodation and other living expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to these broader issues, a number of the problems which Austudy and Abstudy have in relation to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 are specific to the schemes. Unlike the social security situation, the recognition of de facto relationships in the Austudy context would generally result in increased eligibility for benefits. In the social security context, beneficiaries actually have a financial
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5551"> disincentive for establishing de facto relationships as their combined eligibility is reduced as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Austudy, a person who is married is considered to be independent for purposes of the scheme, and is eligible for a higher rate of Austudy than the rate payable to a student who is considered to be dependent. If de facto relationships are treated the same as marriage&mdash;that is, as a ground for independent status&mdash;there would be a financial incentive for establishing the existence of a de facto relationship so that the student is eligible for a higher rate of Austudy. This would make it difficult for the scheme administrators to verify the legitimacy of de facto relationships. Abstudy experiences similar problems under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in relation to living allowances, income testing and eligibility for rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Austudy and Abstudy schemes initially had a legislative exemption from the operation of those provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 proscribing discrimination on the ground of marital status. The Austudy and Abstudy schemes currently have an administrative exemption from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in relation to the marital status provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The administrative exemption expires, however, on 31 December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Non&hyphen;legislative options for dealing with this issue have been explored, however, these would have serious social or financial repercussions. Failure to take the action proposed would mean that complaints could be made under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 once the existing administrative exemption has expired. It is therefore necessary that this amending legislation be in place by 1 January 1998. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill provides for this government's commitment to two initiatives. The first is its commitment to lift the requirement for at least 10 per cent of enrolled students to be indigenous before a non&hyphen;government non&hyphen;systemic preschool, school or vocational education and training institution can be funded under the indigenous education strategic initiatives program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment leaves in place the requirement for there to be a minimum of 20 students in a non&hyphen;government non&hyphen;systemic school and a non&hyphen;government non&hyphen;systemic VET institution and for there to be a minimum of five students in a non&hyphen;government non&hyphen;systemic preschool. These limits will avoid the administrative expense of providing small amounts of money to small numbers of scattered students. It will also avoid the situation where there will be little or no benefit to individual students from the provision of small grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment will enable institutions where there are significant numbers of Indigenous students, but these students represent less than 10 per cent of total enrolments, to qualify for funding under the act. Experience has shown that the 10 per cent requirement has excluded some institutions from receiving supplementary funding in respect of their indigenous students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second amendment will permit the adjustment of grants under the indigenous education strategic initiatives program in line with cost increases for the period up to 30 June 2000. The appropriations for these years are in subsections 13b(4), (5), (6) and (7) in the principal act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Introduction</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill contains several important amendments to five existing acts, the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Airports Act 1996, the Air Services Act 1995, the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 and the International Air Services Commission Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Air Navigation Act 1920 Amendments</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments concern the security screening of passengers boarding large commercial aircraft within Australia. The amendments represent a minor change to Australia's aviation security regulatory framework based on operational reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, arrangements under the Air Navigation Act 1920 make individual aircraft operators responsible for passenger screening for certain domestic and international aircraft operations. The responsibility for segregating passengers who have been screened from those who have not also currently rests with the airlines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In larger airport terminals around the country the favoured method for segregating screened persons before they board an aircraft is to screen into sterile areas. Sterile areas offer savings in security costs by minimising the required level of screening staff and equipment compared to screening passengers at individual gate lounges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the increasingly commercial approach being taken by airport terminal operators to non&hyphen;aeronautical revenue raising, more and more commercial activities, such as retail outlets, are being located within sterile areas, where the departing passengers tend to congregate. These activities are controlled by the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> operators of the passenger terminal buildings through the terminal operator leases and not by the airlines. The operation of these commercial activities, particularly the need to restock out of hours, and some of the delivery practices for goods and services do have an impact on the security of the sterile area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, the government proposes to centralise the responsibility for sterile area access control and passenger screening into the one organisation. This will be achieved by making terminal operators primarily responsible for passenger screening at sterile areas.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In summary, these amendments will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">ensure that airlines remain responsible for what is carried on their aircraft and for passenger screening when a sterile area is not used to segregate passengers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">ensure that airlines remain responsible for the segregation of their passengers between a sterile area approved under the new arrangements and their aircraft;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">make operators of terminals, in which sterile areas operate, responsible for access control and passenger screening, with the Department of Transport and Regional Development having the power to designate the sterile area and any conditions of operation; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">ensure that these arrangements are sufficiently flexible to allow the department to designate an airline or airlines (or other persons, with their consent) to be responsible for passenger screening into a sterile area where local circumstances indicate that this would give better security outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Airports Act 1996 Amendment</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes a minor amendment to the Airports Act 1996 that allows fees to be levied under regulations made for the purposes of environment protection at leased airports. This will allow partial cost recovery of administrative expenses associated with processing administrative and other approvals under the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Air Services Act 1995 Amendment</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Airservices Australia's primary function is to provide for the safe navigation of aircraft. This is essential in a large country with
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5553"> population centres separated by long distances. Australia's aviation industry plays an important role in providing rapid, safe and reliable communication links&mdash;it is one of Australia's key strategic industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Airservices plays a vital role in this industry, providing essential air traffic and other services to all participants. Given Airservices' special position, the government believes it has a key role to play in encouraging and promoting the overall benefits of an efficient aviation industry. Airservices will continually review the services it provides to ensure it is meeting industry's genuine needs and is not placing impediments in the way of growth in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To this end, Airservices must continually strive to provide its services by the most cost effective means, at the same time structuring its pricing as far as practical to ensure industry participants are paying for the services they actually use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I need to emphasise, however, that the change to legislation will not, in the government's view, require Airservices Australia to ensure the viability of any individual operator; nor will it require that the aspirations of any particular aviation sector be met. The Airservices Australia Board will be expected to take this objective into account in their strategic planning, principally, and I will be writing to the chairman to this effect.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 Amendment</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment will ensure that de facto spouses are included among the members of a passenger's family for the purposes of being eligible for the compensation available under the act in the event of the passenger's death or injury as a result of an air accident. De facto spouses are currently excluded from compensation and this is contrary to the Commonwealth's own policy and legislation relating to discrimination on the grounds of marital status.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">International Air Services Commission Act 1992 Amendments</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this government came to office, capacity for international services to and from Australia has increased by 17 per cent over
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the accumulated capacity increases of the past 50 years. That equates to an additional 135 Boeing 747 scheduled services per week available to fly to and from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with this massive increase in capacity available for Australian and overseas carriers to service the Australian market, there has been a rapid increase in the sophistication with which Australian carriers have approached their operations overseas. Like many Australian businesses, the future growth of Australian international airlines can be enhanced by operating effectively and efficiently in overseas markets. As part of this development, Australian carriers will be seeking to establish networks combining overseas markets into a potentially fully integrated service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1992, when multiple designation of Australia's carriers on international routes was introduced, the International Air Services Commission has been allocating Australian capacity for services between Australia and other countries in a process that has been widely acknowledged as transparent, independent and equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While not a major aspect of previous Australian carrier operations, the International Air Services Commission Act did however prevent the commission from allocating capacity between points outside Australia available to Australian carriers under Australia's air services arrangements. The amendments in this bill will allow the commission to rightly assume responsibility for this function from the Department of Transport and Regional Development in an orderly manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment represents the final step in ensuring the complete independence of capacity allocation from capacity negotiation and will provide certainty to Australian scheduled carriers by confirming the commission's role as the single independent authority for allocating all rights available under air services arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the structural complexity of international air services increases and Australian carriers become more sophisticated in the way in which they apply allocations of capacity to particular markets, the commission will increasingly be called upon to consider the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5554"> nature of any cooperation between Australian carriers or between Australian carriers and foreign carriers and how that might affect the use of the capacity that the commission allocates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill therefore provides additional guidance for the International Air Services Commission on what constitutes a `joint international service' for the purpose of allocating capacity, without reducing the commission's flexibility in their determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also makes some technical amendments, including the removal of definitions of new and shelf capacity which are now redundant, the inclusion of a provision to allow the commission to revoke a determination at the request of an Australian carrier to whom that determination relates and a new provision to ensure that the proposed amendments do not affect current operations between points outside Australia by Australian carriers. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of this bill is to implement a package of enhancements to Australia's marine cargo liability regime. The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991, which is often referred to as the COGSA, deals with liability for loss or damage to sea cargoes. The package is the result of extensive negotiations with, and agreement by, all affected interests&mdash;shippers, cargo owners, carriers, shipowners, marine insurers and maritime lawyers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seek leave to table the document which records the package of changes which maritime industry interests have agreed should be made to improve our marine cargo liability regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XT4">Mr RONALDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The COGSA operates by applying as domestic law in Australia an international convention and several protocols collectively known as the amended Hague Rules. However, the COGSA also provides for the possible future implementation of an alternative international convention commonly known as the Hamburg Rules.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill I have introduced to amend the COGSA deals directly with two of the seven items in the industry package&mdash;the Hamburg Rules trigger now contained in the COGSA, and arbitration in Australia. The other five items in the industry package, dealing with documents, coverage of importers, deck cargo, duration of liability and liability for delays will be implemented by regulations to be made under the act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Hamburg Rules trigger</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hamburg Rules, although a more recent convention than the amended Hague Rules, have attracted very little support from major trading nations, including Australia's major trading partners. The Hamburg Rules trigger was first due to operate on 1 November 1994. Prior to that date there had been vigorous debate between shipper interests proposing the implementation of the Hamburg Rules and carrier interests opposing this. In October 1994, both houses of parliament passed resolutions to defer consideration of the question of acceptance or repeal of the Hamburg Rules for another three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following this resolution an industry working group developed a compromise solution in which carriers conceded significant extensions in the protection offered to shippers in return for the removal of the automatic trigger for the Hamburg Rules. I would like to congratulate the industry interests concerned on the spirit in which this process was conducted. This bill implements that compromise solution developed by industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5555">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, the automatic trigger provision will operate again on 20 October 1997 to bring the Hamburg Rules into force in the COGSA, and action is therefore needed to prevent this. This bill will remove that trigger and the requirement for a resolution of both houses of parliament. In its place, provisions are inserted for the minister to conduct a review from time to time of the desirability of bringing the Hamburg Rules into force in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Provision for arbitration</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry has concerns that, under the existing legislation, arbitration has not been available as an option for resolving disputes. The act will now make it clear that arbitration in Australia does not offend section 11 of the COGSA.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Regulation making provision</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill includes a power to make regulations to implement the highly technical elements of the industry&hyphen;endorsed package dealing with:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Coverage of a wider range of contracts of carriage, including electronic documents by the COGSA;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Providing coverage for importers in some circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Coverage of cargo agreed to be carried on deck, in certain circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Extending COGSA coverage from the current `hook&hyphen;to&hyphen;hook' coverage to `terminal&hyphen;to&hyphen;terminal' coverage; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">(e)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Providing limited recompense for shippers' losses due to delays, except where the delays are excusable delays according to criteria well understood in the maritime industry, and which will be defined in the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These changes will extend the protection which the COGSA offers to Australian shippers, particularly exporters. The concepts behind these changes can be simply expressed. However, given the nature of international conventions, the modifications to the amended Hague Rules to make these changes are technically complex and lengthy. Given the need not to overburden parliament's business agenda and recognising that the resources of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Office of Parliamentary Counsel are under pressure, it is quite appropriate that such technical matters be handled by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, the bill includes a very precise regulation making power which will enable the subsequent drafting and making of regulations to implement these changes. This might be regarded as a `Henry VIII clause', which is a clause that permits the making of regulations which have the effect of amending the operation of an act. However, such clauses are used in Commonwealth laws regularly, and enable the expeditious passage of legislation. The regulations are, of course, subject to disallowance, and will be required by the act to be made only after consultation with relevant industry stakeholders.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, while the amendments will enhance the operation of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991, they will have no impact on Commonwealth revenues or outgoings, and no direct financial impact on the industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill seeks to make an amendment to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 to ensure the effectiveness of subsection 50(2D) of the act which prevents land claims over stock routes and stock reserves. The background to this matter is that the previous government entered into a memorandum of agreement in 1989 with the Northern Territory concerning the granting of community living areas to Aboriginal people
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5556"> in pastoral districts in the Northern Territory. As part of the agreement, the Commonwealth undertook to proclaim a 1987 amendment to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 preventing the making of land claims over stock routes and reserves. This amendment was made because it was never intended that stock routes and reserves should be available for claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment was proclaimed in 1990. However, it appears that it may be technically deficient. The effect of the amendment as drafted is that, while the claims cannot be heard by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner as a result of subsection 50(2D), they remain registered. This means that there is some doubt about whether the Northern Territory government can deal with the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments reached an arrangement that an effective amendment be made in exchange for the Northern Territory accepting Commonwealth proposals for amendments to the Northern Territory's Pastoral Land Act 1992. The aim of these amendments is to expedite the granting of community living areas to Aboriginal people, particularly those being dealt with by the Community Living Areas Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, once agreed to by parliament, will conclusively eliminate stock route and stock reserve claims by removing any doubt about the effectiveness of subsection 50(2D) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The amendments contained in this bill before the House will commence on proclamation, with a 12&hyphen;month limit on the time within which the proclamation is to be made. The intended proclamation period has been provided so that, in accordance with the 1995 agreement with the Northern Territory, the amendment can commence the same time as the Northern Territory's amendments to its Pastoral Land Act 1992. There are no financial implications arising from this bill. I commend the amended bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill 1997 is one of the more outrageous pieces of legislation that has been put before this parliament in recent times, not merely because it seeks, contrary to the election commitment of the new government, to privatise Australian National and, incidentally, subsequently privatise the government's holding in the National Rail Corporation, not merely because it threatens large numbers of jobs and significant rail services, not merely because it is based on a gross exaggeration of the financial problems from which Australian National is currently suffering and not merely because it surrounds itself with an entirely fictitious $2 billion reform package which is almost totally comprised of existing obligations on the part of the federal government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is particularly most outrageous about this legislation is the content of the legislation itself because in effect it empowers the two ministers named&mdash;the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport&mdash;to do whatever they like with respect to the future of the rail industry in this country. The bill empowers the two ministers to sell, by their own decision, any assets of Australian National, to set up companies that can be used as halfway houses to transfer assets to private owners, to transfer the Australian National debt to the Commonwealth, to amend or repeal any acts of this parliament or the transfer agreements between the two states involved and this parliament and to wind up the Australian National Railways Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, the parliament is being asked to hand over all of its powers with respect to the legislation surrounding the Australian national railway system to the two ministers. It is being asked to completely abrogate any responsibility that it has for making decisions with respect to the future of the rail system without being told what the two ministers are
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5557"> going to do with these powers. The two ministers, and the government with them, are saying, `Trust us. Give us the power. We intend to flog off Australian National. We may sell it in bits. We may sell it as a single unit. We cannot give you any guarantees about services. We cannot give any guarantees about jobs. We have some general propositions in place.' That is all the parliament is being told and it is now being asked to simply give carte blanche to the two ministers to do whatever they like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has a number of objections to the legislation, which I will get to later, that are contained in the second reading amendment that I will move at the end of my contribution. We also intend to move a set of amendments in the consideration in detail stage relating to the question of the future of the proposed track authority. I will deal first with the background to the situation that faces the parliament with respect to Australian National. In April last year the Chairman of Australian National, Jack Smorgon, wrote to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) indicating that the anticipated loss of Australian National for the 1995-96 year of $26 million was now anticipated to be over $100 million. Naturally, the minister sought to blame the former government and commissioned Mr John Brew to conduct an inquiry into the cause of this financial difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister sought to make cheap political points about the number of job losses and line closures that had occurred in Australian National in the preceding 13 years&mdash;naturally failing to point out that equivalent things had occurred throughout the state systems over that period largely relating to the changes in demand, changes in the freight task and, particularly, changes in technology and productivity. In my own state of Victoria, for example, we have seen very substantial reductions in employment similar to what has occurred in the equivalent systems in places like South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The losses that were anticipated were not unusual in Australian National history. If we go back to the last couple of years of the former conservative government, we see that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in 1982&hyphen;83 Australian National recorded a loss of $106 million. In today's dollars that is roughly $192 million. In 1981&hyphen;82, there was a loss of $73 million and in today's dollars that is roughly $146 million. We have seen a pattern over a number of years where there has been a substantial subsidy from the Commonwealth to the operations of Australian National. It has varied from time to time, but it has generally been fairly substantial, albeit often nowhere near as substantial as rail is subsidised in other parts of the Commonwealth by the state systems and in other parts of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally speaking, direct government subsidisation to rail is the norm throughout most of the world. The effective community subsidisation that goes to roads through the direct construction of roads and the financing of roads and also through indirect costs associated with road trauma, pollution and the like is very difficult to compare to the direct subsidisation that goes to rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the more recent figures for Australian National, we see that in 1992-93 it had a bad year because of the recession, 1993-94 was one of its best years for a long time and 1994-95 was not such a good year but not much worse than 1993-94 and certainly better than some of the years in the early 1990s. So, for the last full financial year figures that the former government had available to it, Australian National was basically doing reasonable well relative to its history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In December 1995, the chairman spoke to the former Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), who was told not that the organisation was in financial trouble but rather that there were questions with respect to the current CEO and that the board wished to deal with those matters, which could potentially include dismissal. The then transport minister indicated quite properly that the government was almost in caretaker mode, an election was pending and it would be more appropriate for such matters to be dealt with under the auspices of the incoming transport minister and transport administration.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5558">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the wake of that, the government then instigated the Brew inquiry which was essentially a very narrow accounting exercise that looked only at the balance sheets for each of Australian National's businesses. It anticipated that the loss for the 1995-96 financial year would be somewhere between $130 million and $148 million. It identified the creation of National Rail in 1991-92 as the key reason for the decline in Australian National's fortunes which, I hasten to point out&mdash;a fact that the minister does not ever mention in the House&mdash;was ultimately forced on the Labor government by the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government wanted to have National Rail's functions essentially as part of Australian National, but the states refused to do that. In order to create an integrated interstate rail system, which achieved massive improvements in the public sector deficit with respect to rail freight, the former government separated National Rail from Australian National. That then had an adverse consequence for the operations of Australian National because the bulk of its profitable activities were now part of an another organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brew inquiry recommended wholesale closures and sell-offs and made a range of fairly harsh recommendations based on very narrow consultations and a very narrow perspective on the overall operation of Australian National and the rail industry. No consideration was given to the nature of the rail task. No consideration was given to the role of rail in the overall transport network, the interaction between rail and other modes of transport. No consideration was given to the significance of community service obligations and the current operations of things such as the passenger services or the grain lines in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No serious analysis was made of the performance of management, something which particularly sticks in the craw of many AN workers. No analysis was made of the merits of separating out all of the various components of AN's operations and setting them up as separate businesses, following a very popular management fad which we can see throughout most of the private sector in recent
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> times and, indeed, in some parts of the public sector of separating different components of an industry, particularly on a vertical basis, and establishing them as autonomous business units with an attendant array of considerable transaction costs and complications that, in my view, mostly will cancel out or even end up as an overall negative relative to any efficiency gains that may be attained by that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of Labor's return to order motion in the Senate, the Brew inquiry report was forced to be made public, albeit a slightly doctored version. In the debate that followed the minister first claimed that the Labor Party in government did nothing about Australian National's problems. Then a day later, when the report had been released and Australian National had issued a press release calling for expressions of interest for the sale of a substantial part of AN's businesses, the minister then sought to blame this on the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, on the one hand, the former government did nothing to address AN's financial crises but, on the other hand, when it became clear that AN was already moving to sell off substantial parts of its operations this was blamed on the former government. Of course it soon became very clear when a letter leaked from the minister to the Chairman of Australian National, dated 15 August, that the actions Australian National were taking had been taken specifically at the request and instruction of the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final blow to the credibility of the Brew report came in September of last year when it emerged that Mr Brew had, shortly after submitting the report, engaged himself in discussions with one of the front runners, the Great Southern Railway Corporation based on Macquarie Bank, to buy parts of Australian National with respect to possibilities that he may become a consultant. In fact, the discussions had reached a stage where Macquarie Bank and the Great Southern Railway Corporation felt it was appropriate that they could advertise their prospective running of Australian National in the future, mentioning the fact that they would have the unique expertise of John Brew on board as a consultant. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5559">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, although no agreement was finalised, Mr Brew obviously had it in his mind when conducting his inquiry that at the conclusion of that inquiry there would be some substantial opportunities for people with rail expertise to make a dollar out of the dismembering of Australian National. As far as the opposition is concerned, that tainted the whole inquiry, and the inquiry really does not amount to a great deal in the overall perspective that we need to develop with respect to the future of the rail industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we saw in November the reform package, as it has been dubbed in Orwellian language, from the minister in which the minister announced the total privatisation of Australian National with respect to the main line interstate track. It was originally all of the mainland track, but it is now the main line interstate track on the mainland. This could occur either as a totality or in pieces. The government's ownership of its share of National Rail would also be included, even though that was not recommended by John Brew and was a good illustration of the government's hypocrisy on this issue. Australian National was being sold, we are told, simply because its finances were in difficulty and it needed private ownership to get it back on an even keel and the government needed to get out of a potentially spiralling deficit with respect to rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, on the other hand, the government's share of National Rail was also going to be sold even though National Rail was doing quite well, was roughly on target to achieve its five&hyphen;year objective to a commercial break&hyphen;even point, albeit with one or two problems on the way but nonetheless doing quite well, and had, in the words of the minister's own department, improved the interstate rail transport freight deficit from $350 million in the early 1990s to $50 million in 1995-96. So the contradiction in the government's position was very strongly exposed by what it was actually doing. It was seeking to sell both, even though the NRC sale was not proposed by Brew and even though the justification for selling AN was completely irrelevant and not applicable with respect to NRC.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package that was put forward was almost totally fictitious. It included, for example, $580&hyphen;odd million relating to superannuation. What did that reflect? When you actually went into it, what it reflected was that for many years Australian National has been fully funding its superannuation but paying its obligations into consolidated revenue with the Commonwealth meeting its obligations from time to time. In other words, that $580 million was simply an existing obligation that the Commonwealth always had and always would have. Similarly, with respect to the debt, $790-odd million worth of debt was already a Commonwealth liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $50 million for the environmental clean&hyphen;up was based on an estimate put forward by Australian National with respect to the total cost that would apply if all of its sites had to be cleaned up&mdash;in other words, in effect, if all rail operations were closed down, which would be the circumstance in which you would have an obligation for an environmental clean&hyphen;up. In most cases, the contamination that this relates to is the sort of standard common&hyphen;or&hyphen;garden contamination you will get with any form of industrial or transport activity with land&mdash;things like diesel spills and the like. That $50 million is clearly something that may never eventuate. Some of it will, but the total is essentially an imaginary figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this so-called package there was no statement with respect to anticipated proceeds, a measly $20 million for regional assistance, no guarantee of jobs or services and no requirement on the buyers to keep any part of the existing AN network operating. The $20 million that was specified for regional assistance was described by the Chief Executive Officer of the Spencer Regions Development Association, Mr Rod Nettle, who I understand is a former National Party candidate for Grey, as `a Laurel and Hardy show' and `3,000 new beach barbecue sets' as being the net impact that would have, particularly in places like the Iron Triangle and Port Augusta. This was made in submissions to the Senate rail inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister claimed that the actual loss for Australian National was $250 million in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5560"> 1995&hyphen;96. First it had been anticipated to be $26 million, then AN suggested about $106 million, then Mr Brew suggested $135 million to $148 million. But&mdash;shock, horror&mdash;it had actually blown out to $250 million. What he did not tell us, and what he did not tell anybody else, was that the bulk of this $250 million was in fact one&hyphen;off asset revaluations that AN had undertaken over that period which have to be put in the accounts somewhere and do have some significance, but they are quite distinct from an ongoing deficit. It is reasonable to suppose that, if you have a situation where there is an operating deficit of a certain level based on current revenue and current expenditure, that will continue in the future unless something is done to change the situation, whereas an asset revaluation is a one-off exercise that will not reappear in the deficit in the following year and the year after that. But, of course, none of this was mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The actual operating deficit for AN in that year ended up being $69 million, $14 million higher than the $54 million that was the operating deficit in the 1994-95 year&mdash;not a great outcome and not a fantastic result by any means. Certainly, there were issues with AN that needed to be addressed, but these have been grossly exaggerated by the minister in order to justify simply getting the Commonwealth out of rail, removing the subsidies that have been there for a long time under governments of both persuasions and simply abdicating any responsibility for the future of rail transport in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then, we have had the expressions of interest process. A number of organisations, both Australian and foreign, have expressed some form of interest in buying parts of Australian National. We have had various statements of general intention on the part of the government but very little serious detail. I would suggest that the House take one step back on this issue for a minute to consider an interesting contrast. The most recent major total privatisation that we have dealt with, certainly in the transport area, has been the airport sales legislation. When you look at that legislation, it is very thick, substantial, very detailed and it puts forward a framework
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with respect to the future operation of Australia's airports, the obligations of the new owners and all of the regulatory structures that apply to that in considerable detail. It covers concerns about the environment, noise and the operations of airport owners vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis the airlines&mdash;not perfectly, one or two things were not properly addressed, but certainly, overwhelmingly, all of those issues were dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet in this instance&mdash;another transport privatisation which is of major significance to Australia's transport system and of major significance to Australia's transport users&mdash;what do we have? We have a very small bill, a bill that in effect says that the parliament empowers the ministers to do what they like. That amounts to an outrageous abrogation of parliamentary sovereignty, something that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), who is at the table, would have loved to have spoken about in opposition. No doubt she has different views about it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It means that not only the opposition but also the Independents and the minor parties in the Senate, who are entitled to represent their constituents, to be part of a debate and to be part of decisions about the future of the industry, are in effect being told, `You have a situation where you are being asked to empower the ministers to do anything they like, simply sign off, on the future of the system. Yes, there will be a few disallowable instruments involved in that, but ultimately you're going to be in a position where your ability to make decisions with respect to detail about the future of the industry has been taken away.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's specific objections to the legislation, more particularly to what it does not deal with and what it does not address, are as follows. Firstly, there is no reference at all to the establishment of the long awaited Track Authority&mdash;it has had various names; it was going to be Track Australia under the former government&mdash;and, effectively, the legislation empowers the two ministers to establish this authority without further reference to the parliament. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5561">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this legislation gets through in its current form&mdash;we will be moving amendments in consideration in detail to prevent this later on today&mdash;the proposed National Rail Infrastructure Authority, which will manage the track and which will be retained in Commonwealth ownership, will be able to be established by this government with no further reference to the parliament. Decisions about the types of access regimes that apply with respect to the use of the track, how it will be maintained, what sort of labour will be used and the types of funding arrangements will be taken out of the jurisdiction of this parliament with no further potential for the parliament&mdash;for people who represent constituencies in the parliament&mdash;to deal with those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is more particularly significant that there is no reference to this proposal when we consider the recent budgetary estimates that have been applied with respect to the Track Authority. In 1995, under the then Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, the Labor government committed itself to $370 million over five years for the Track Authority. This was reduced to about $240-odd million in the budget of last year. Again this year it has been reduced to $185 million, although the minister seems to be a bit confused because he put out a press release saying it was $175 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an extraordinary example of how little there was for transport in this year's budget, he actually sought to make a virtue out of a vice and put out a press release proclaiming how wonderful it was that the government was going to set up a track authority&mdash;something that the government had previously announced, something that the previous government had previously announced and something on which he was now proposing to spend less than half what the former government was going to spend. But he had so little to say and so little good news that he had to turn bad news into good news. I do not think too many people were fooled by it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue on which there is great concern on the part of the opposition, and I suspect other parties in this parliament, is that there are no details in this legislation with
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> respect to the regulatory arrangements that will apply with respect to the operations of the rail system. Clearly, there is a substantial difference, as there is in the airline industry. When you remove dominant public sector operation and replace it with private operation you have to have a different regulatory regime. There are questions of train control, operation, safety, access and all sorts of things that need to be dealt with. Again the parliament is being told, `Don't you worry about that. Leave that up to the ministers. We'll sort all that out. You don't have any entitlement to a say.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third issue the opposition is concerned about is that there is no guarantee with respect to services. People in western New South Wales, for example, are worried&mdash;and with good reason&mdash;about the future of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS>, which plays a very significant role for communities such as Broken Hill, Parkes and the like as a major transport artery. Others are worried about the future of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Overland</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ghan</EMPHASIS> and, of course, things like the grain lines in South Australia, the freight lines in Tasmania, and so it goes on. We are not being told anything. No guarantees have been given about the future of these operations or the future of community service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is particularly concerned also about a number of issues that apply with respect to the work force of Australian National. There is no labour adjustment program. Undoubtedly, if privatisation proceeds, some workers will get jobs with future private operators, but many will not. If those workers are in places like Port Augusta, their ability to access training to ensure they have some chance of getting future employment in alternative areas is very limited and very costly without there being a labour adjustment program, such as the program the former government put in place with respect to workers who had been retrenched from Australian National but which this government cut and now refuses to replace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no specific provision being made for most apprentices currently employed by Australian National, particularly people who are roughly in the middle of their apprentice
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5562"> ship; suddenly, they are going to be left high and dry. No guarantees have been given about their future. No guarantees have been given that they will be able to complete their apprenticeship, the learning of the skills in their acquisition of the trade for which they were taken on by Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no detail about the future shape of the industry, the future role that the industry will play with respect to the overall transport picture in the economic arrangements of Australia. There is no guarantee that predatory asset stripping will not occur, particularly with things like the workshops, where there are many private competitors and a significant oversupply of workshop capacity. One of the risks that this government should be guarding against, and the parliament should be concerned about, is the proposition that another owner may buy one of those workshops, strip it of its saleable or useable assets and close it down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, in recent weeks two issues with respect to the entitlements of workers have emerged with which the government has failed to deal and which are of considerable concern. Superannuation is one. The Australian National principal scheme, which was established seven years ago, does not have full vesting entitlements for workers who are deemed to have resigned. In fact, I think it takes 15 years before you get full vesting rights to the employer contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That means that it is impossible for workers who are in that scheme to get their full superannuation entitlements. But they are not resigning, even though they are deemed under the scheme to be resigning; they are being retrenched&mdash;they are being compulsorily retrenched in effect. They are being denied their full superannuation entitlements, yet an amount of $4&half; million in surplus is anticipated to be in the fund once all of these arrangements are completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we will be seeing somewhere in the vicinity of a third of the workers in Australian National being denied their full superannuation entitlements and, at the same time, the government&mdash;because it is the government who controls the decisions&mdash;effectively reaping $4&half; million out of their money. That
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is, money that has been put aside by their employer for them, for their superannuation, will be taken by the government. That is outrageous. It is something that the government has known about for some time and has refused to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final issue, the full detail about which I am still endeavouring to find out, relates to a small number of people who have resigned on ill-health workers compensation. After having been told that they would not get a redundancy, Australian National then apparently changed its mind and said, `Yes, people in that situation will be included in the redundancies, but not retrospectively.' It would appear that there may be some people who, since the minister's announcement, have resigned and who are now in a position where they are being told they will not get the redundancy but that those who are in the same situation who have not yet resigned will get the redundancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, the government is saying, `Trust us, give us carte blanche, give the two ministers the capacity to do what they like and&mdash;don't you worry about that&mdash;they'll make the decisions about the future of the industry.' It is abundantly clear that they have no vision, no strategy, no plan for the future of rail in this country; no sense of how rail can play a substantial, continuing role in our overall transport arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We disagree with the privatisation of Australian National; we do not support it. But our overall commitment, beyond that issue, is to the best available rail system with the most number of jobs, the best quality services and the greatest efficiency for the transport system in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that the Launceston <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS>&mdash;not necessarily renowned as a great supporter of the Labor Party&mdash;described our reasons for taking the response we are taking with respect to the legislation as reasonable. In fact, I quote from their editorial of 28 May: `Labor's declared reasons for deferral sound reasonable.' I think that says it all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unions are opposed to the sale for similar reasons. The representatives of the workers in Australian National have put
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5563"> forward similar justifications. However, the minister had the gall to stand up here the other day in question time and say that I did not have the guts to go to Port Augusta. I was there on Monday to talk to the workers for the second time since this issue has emerged. The minister has not been there since he became a minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former minister, the member for Kingsford-Smith, had the guts to front up there. He had the guts to go along when sometimes there was bad news, such as that involving more retrenchments. He had the guts to go there and talk to the workers and explain the government's position. This minister will not. There is a rumour that he might go there in July. That has been promised before, so we will wait and see.</PARA>

The opposition is concerned that further delay may damage Australian National further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us ask where the delay is coming from. It has taken weeks for this debate even to occur. The government has not been able to organise its own schedule to get the legislation quickly to this House&mdash;and, indeed, the same will occur with the Senate. The process of bidding, discussions and expressions of interest has been prolonged. So what is happening now is: yes, there is delay, but it is being caused by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has put its position out into the public arena very early. It has indicated to the government that there are a number of issues that it should be addressing and is failing to address and that the current legislation is completely unacceptable. The government, as yet, has failed to respond. We are throwing down the challenge to the government to address these issues&mdash;both the broad, big picture issues with respect to the future of rail in this country and also, importantly, the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> specific issues that relate to the interests of the workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment we have a fire sale. We have no plan, no vision for the future, no guarantees with respect to the future of services, no guarantees with respect to the future of jobs and no guarantees with respect to the future of those who cannot get jobs and their capacity to retrain. We have a situation where all of the other players&mdash;the unions, minor parties in the Senate and the Labor Party&mdash;are saying, `What we need is some detail of the government's plans and the capacity to address these issues, to actually play a proper role as a parliament, as representatives of the Australian people.' At the moment all we are getting is: trust us, carte blanche, abuse from the minister, and absolute hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the situations where the Senate and the parliament can exercise genuine accountability, can require accountability of the government. This government effectively is asking this parliament to abrogate its responsibility as a legislative body and simply hand over all power to the two ministers to make all decisions with respect to the future of the Australian rail industry without telling the parliament and without telling AN workers what it intends to do.

I said, `There is not much point sending faxes to the shadow minister for transport because I do not think he is going to let that on to anybody.' After hearing what he said this morning, it is clear that he has painted an entirely different picture. Labor wants to go on in the same old way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Losses for 1995-96 were likely to be around $150 million with debts and liabilities exceeding $1 billion. Yet Labor would like us to go on the same old way. Over the 13 years that Labor was in government, 7,000 jobs have gone. The Brew report commissioned by the government has been most useful because it has told us lots, but we did not have to rely
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the Brew report; we only had to speak to the workers who have worked for AN. I have met some whose fathers and grandfathers have worked on the railways, as have other colleagues of mine. But, no, the member for Kingsford Smith (Mr Brereton) as recently as January 1996&mdash;just a few days before the election was announced&mdash;was saying at the Islington workshops in my electorate that all was well, everything was on track, there was no need for anyone to be concerned. This was at a time when he had already signed off more jobs to the dust heap. It was a time when the election was about to be announced. Labor's record with rail is absolutely disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the shadow minister for transport, who has quickly disappeared out the door, really knows this. There is no better example than the fact that there is no member of the opposition from Tasmania or South Australia speaking on this legislation this morning. That is an indication that they know they have been wrong. No member from those states that are most affected is prepared to come in here and defend Labor and defend the fact that they have said they will block this in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators from Tasmania or South Australia will be doing their states no good at all by blocking this sale. Rail has been on the decline; there are difficulties there. Governments just have not managed it terribly well. When this government comes along after only 15 months in office and tries to do something, they want to spoil it. They would rather stand on their hopeless record than join us in a bipartisan way to see whether something can be done to maintain a viable rail industry for Australia and viable jobs for the people suffering from the lack of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has been to Port Augusta too.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the comments made by the shadow minister are not too difficult to rebut. Towards the end of his speech he said  that there were problems with superannuation. The government has already committed $112 million to refund redundancy payouts as well as $580 million to cover superannuation and an extra $90 million to cover unfunded contributions such as leave. Then we come in here and hear these unsubstantiated claims from the shadow minister for transport. It is an absolute disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister does not seem to want to believe this. He claims that he has the support of the unions, and this is what I find most amazing. In yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, a South Australian paper, the public transport union state secretary, Mr Rex Phillips, warned that any delay would cause `un&hyphen;needed heartache and grief for workers'. That is certainly the message that I have been getting from the workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might seem strange to some members on the other side that a Liberal member is hearing more stories from union membership than they are themselves. I have to say that I have enjoyed the trust which has developed through being able to represent workers from the Islington workshops over a period of years who know that when they ring my office they are going to get attention and be given assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note the transcript of an ABC radio interview from Port Augusta in the last couple of days. The shadow minister has claimed credit for visiting Port Augusta when there are people up there who thought he should have stayed away. The newsreader stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rail unions say they're worse off after a meeting with the federal opposition's shadow transport minister in Port Augusta on the future of Australian National. Lindsay Tanner has met about 50 work
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ers. The federal opposition has threatened to block the sale of AN but Len Scharenberg of the Australian Workers Union says that means no job guarantees for the workers. He says the opposition has turned its back on rail workers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the unions in Port Augusta. Later in the interview, when asked whether there was any point to the visit, Len Scharenberg said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well after a fair bit of soul searching the majority of the workers in Port Augusta had agreed to a sale, we seen that as the best way of keeping the workshops viable, and then to see our own people coming out and endorsing the blocking of the sale, it sort of left us with a bit of egg on our face.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also the faxes that I have had. He said, as he was walking out interjecting, that he had three faxes. I am just wondering&mdash;I know he is after the leadership at some time in the future&mdash;if he has been honest enough to tell the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) about the messages he is getting.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is unfair to prolong the uncertainty and urge you and your fellow ministers to do all in your power to allow the sale process to continue with the sale taking place as soon as possible.

<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what the workers, the union membership, supposedly your supporters, the people you have deserted, are saying. No wonder they are communicating with a Liberal member of parliament. They know they are going to get better representation. They know somebody will stand up in this place and put their case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the previous minister for transport in the last government had honestly consulted with them and acted on things, then there would not have been any need for a Brew report because he would have been putting changes in action then and the taxpayers of Australia
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would not be funding the debts that they are now having to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of government ownership of railways in Australia has seen a declining work force, declining market share and spiralling debts. Government ownership has resulted in the political intervention in the rail industry to the detriment of its long-term viability and, as I have already demonstrated to you this morning, to the detriment of the workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has allowed government owned rail operations to behave as monopolistic providers of services, inflexible in their practices and unresponsive to the needs of customers. The rail industry needs 10, 20 or 30 years planning and this has not been achieved when short-term political ends have dictated investment decisions, rail operations and reform. Last weekend, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> highlighted the problem of government ownership of rail where the New South Wales rail union is opposing efforts to reform rail maintenance in New South Wales, reforms designed to achieve greater efficiency in rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The involvement of the private sector in rail is not unique to Australia, once again something that you did not hear from the shadow minister this morning. It has occurred and continues to occur around the world&mdash;in Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States, Asia and even South America and New Zealand. Evidence from all countries demonstrates that, although the particular environments of each are different, the common threads of private sector investment, introduction of competition and provision of access have led to a revitalised rail and new opportunities in that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Countries where the private sector has become involved in taking over moribund rail operations have seen old lines reopened, new lines constructed, freight tonnages increased, new rail jobs created, private sector investment in track and rolling stock, and a much greater focus on customer service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already demonstrated to you this morning, the Labor Party's history of ownership of AN is appalling&mdash;job losses, line closures, freight lost and massive spiralling debt. Labor told the AN work force that all
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5567"> was well and that they would have jobs in the future. Yet the Labor Party secretly signed off hundreds of rail jobs and approved the business plans that would see further service reductions and job losses. The AN Commission itself knew that this was not true as the chairman advised Minister Sharp on his coming to office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, as I have mentioned, commissioned the Brew report to reveal the true position&mdash;7,000 jobs gone in 13 years; 50 per cent of the South Australian rail network closed and ripped up; a $1 billion debt with no way of servicing it; passenger rail services to Mount Gambier, Burra, Peterborough, Port Augusta, Whyalla, and Broken Hill all closed; a reduction in the frequency of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> services; and the closure of the Trans&hyphen;Australian rail service, a train that operated Adelaide-Perth and supplemented the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> which operates Sydney-Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brew report revealed that AN employees were being subsidised by the taxpayer by $30,000 per head per annum, and this would increase to $220,000 per annum if nothing was done. But today Labor says they do not want us to do anything about it. Business levels were decreasing and there was no way that AN could cover its costs. It was technically bankrupt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report revealed that the way the former Labor government had set up National Rail was the cause of much of AN's problems. National Rail was given all the best assets and the revenue generating interstate business, and AN was left with all the debt and no possibility of repaying the debt. AN was doomed from the day National Rail began, as Senator Collins is quoted as saying in the Senate references committee hearings in Adelaide and Port Augusta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government announced a $2 billion reform program to fix these problems. The government is selling Australian National and its shares in National Rail and is setting up a national track authority to bring single management to the interstate standard gauge network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of AN is supported by AN workers, as I have explained this morning. It is supported by a petition to the Senate signed
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by 120 workers of Australian National at Port Augusta. It is supported by the customers of Australian National. I have got copies of letters outlining this support. It is supported by the South Australian and Tasmanian governments. It is supported by the Australian Rail Association, the peak rail industry body with over 80 members. It is supported by Rail 2000, the rail lobby group in South Australia. It is supported by the AN Commission and management. It is supported by National Rail. As I have also said, evidence around the world supports private sector enterprise investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor, as we have heard from the shadow minister this morning, would not have us believe any of that. They are delaying the $20 million rail reform transition program and the benefits it will bring to rural South Australia and the metropolitan and north&hyphen;western suburbs of Adelaide. That $20 million is for the creation of long&hyphen;term, sustainable jobs. It is not for programs in which somebody goes in and comes out at the other end after six months and still does not have a real job. They are programs that will lead to long&hyphen;term, sustainable jobs. I have been chairing some consultative meetings on this issue. I am a member of the state committee looking at the matter. I know about the quality of many of the submissions that have been put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the first round of $10 million goes to the Port Augusta region, but $1.5 million will be available for the north&hyphen;western suburbs, some of which are in my electorate, and people there will benefit from that. But it will be held up; those programs will not go ahead. They will not stand a chance. That first round of $10 million will not be available until after this sale legislation is passed. So if Labor, Democrat and Independent senators wish to do something for South Australia and Tasmania, they know what course of action they can take when this legislation reaches the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate had a committee inquiry into the matter. It was interesting to note some of the things that were said during that inquiry. Senator Collins, as I have already mentioned, was quoted in regard to what had happened to Australian National when National Rail
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5568"> was set up. The colourful Mayor of Port Augusta, Joy Baluch, who stands up for her city, had things to say as well. She could not believe that any senator would be dumb enough&mdash;I think those were the words she used&mdash;to block the sale. Senator Collins asked her how many senators she knew. Her reply was, `Well, I know you, dear.' So from the city of Port Augusta there were strong words of support. Many letters, faxes and editorials in the media have been written in support of the sale, and many workers want AN sold. From the workshops at Islington, from the workers and unions, who obviously speak to me more frankly and more frequently than they communicate with the Labor Party&mdash;that party which is meant to be supporting them&mdash;there has been strong support for the sale of Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that after Labor's record during its 13 years in government they would join us in doing something about this. If the problems are not solved, there will not be a viable industry. Rail is important. As my colleague the member for Grey has told the chamber, rail has a proud history. It helped to open up this country. As I said, I have met workers whose fathers and grandfathers worked on the rail. They must be given a chance. We must look at ways of doing things differently. If there have been failures in the past, there is no point in going on in the same old way and having one failure after another. I call on all parties to get together on this, to do the decent thing and support the sale of Australian National.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The history of Liberal and National Party governments in respect of rail services in this country is a very shabby history. If the honourable member for Adelaide wants to refer, as her opening gambit, to losses incurred by AN, let me remind her that when we came to government in 1983 the loss incurred in the previous year by the Australian National Railways Commission&mdash;which at that time embraced all of its services, from Kalgoorlie across to Broken Hill and from Alice Springs down to Adelaide and all the country rail services in South Australia&mdash;in today's terms was $192 million. The AN which she is now referring to is the remnants left after the main&hyphen;line operations were taken out to be absorbed into the National Rail Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we are looking at is the result of the formation of the National Rail Corporation, which was strongly supported by those opposite when in opposition. They cannot have it both ways. If you are going to make comparisons, please make comparisons on a like basis, not a selective basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Adelaide referred to the performance of the government railway systems, as did the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in his second reading speech. He opened with these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian National's operations, in common with many other government owned railways, are characterised by a large and increasing debt and a declining market share. The performance of rail stands in stark contrast to the road transport sector, which has been very successful in addressing customer needs and therefore increasing its market share.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is cynical. It is dishonest. It does not present the picture. Whoever drafted those words knew when they drafted those words that they did not present to this parliament an accurate picture of what constituted AN or the problems with AN&mdash;the segments that were left following the formation of the National Rail Corporation. AN's operations were those sectors and those assets that were left. That had been drafted by a person who knew full well that the National Rail Corporation and revenue earning sections which had been taken out and placed into the National Rail
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5569"> Corporation had been removed. He should not demean all railway people and the performance of the decisions made by this parliament and by the people who manage those organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of AN, certainly the staff at AN, like all other railway people, are proud people. In the railway industry, where there are generations upon generations of people&mdash;starting in the last century&mdash;working in the rail system, they have good right to be proud. They were the people who developed much of this nation, albeit, they destroyed the horse-drawn transport industry and the river boat industry and, in many ways, the coastal shipping industry. But they were the state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art transport system in their time. That generation upon generation of service is a very proud service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have sat in the dust and talked to the people in Port Pirie and in Port Augusta and in Peterborough and in Whyalla on numerous occasions in the past. I very much understand and feel for those people. But what we are seeing in this situation, which is being quite cynically exploited by this government, is that you have people who have had disappointment upon disappointment, who see no future with this government for a publicly owned rail system. They see the sale, getting out and taking a redundancy package, as their only hope of some way out and some way into the future. That has been very carefully exploited by the previous speaker and by this government in the contributions that have been made by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look back to when Australian National was formed, it followed on from the 1975 legislation and then from National Party ministers from 1975 through to 1983 who were responsible for the administration of the Australian National Railways Commission. Their record was a very shabby record but, if you turn to the role that was played by that rail system, to put things in their proper perspective, you will see the posters of the Trans Australia line advertising their travel. They read something like `Trans Australia&mdash;see Australia in comfort', `Save days&mdash;travel Trans Australia'. We have gone from that to where it now takes 3&half; days to get to the west
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by rail and 3&half; hours to come back by air service. So the world has moved on and the nature of the services has moved on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is wrong with this legislation? There are two fundamental things wrong with the legislation. The first is the power&mdash;were this legislation to pass through the Senate&mdash;it would give to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) to virtually do as they will in respect of assets of the organisation and the formation of the national track authority. The second is there is no national strategy. It is not good transport planning to be considering the formation or disintegration of a rail system to the exclusion of all other forms of transport. There is no better source to go to than the recent report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on the Brew report. Their recommendation on page 60 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee therefore recommends that before proceeding with the sale process, the Government should develop a coherent land transport policy framework, taking into account financial, economic, social and environmental goals and recommending mid and long term investment programs for road and rail in all major corridors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a current recommendation, avoided completely in this parliament by this government. Let me go to the report from the national transport planning task force of 1994. Recommendation 2, page viii, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Road, rail, port and airport infrastructure investments and their funding arrangements should be considered within a framework that allows intermodal, network and corridor considerations to be evaluated transparently.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is the best report that has been done on transport needs and the establishment of a proper transport strategy in this nation's history. It is current. It is right across the three forms of transport. It is not being picked up in this legislation. There is no regard had to its recommendations or to its content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we can go to the meeting of this morning's House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Micro Economic Reform and the terms of reference that have been handed to us by the minister. These are the terms of reference for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5570"> the inquiry into the role of rail in the national transport network. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> How current administrative, institutional, operational and pricing arrangements can be improved to promote effective and efficient use of the national rail network, and to investigate the role of the Commonwealth and States/Territories in achieving consistency in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The opportunities to increase the participation of the private sector in the rail industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The opportunities to maximise access to, and utilisation of, the rail network.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Effective investment and ownership arrangements for the rail network.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Characteristics of international best practice in rail operations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are the terms of reference of the inquiry we are about to embark upon, but this legislation precedes all of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this is really from this government the blind leading the blind. There is a bit of a stunt. They see an opportunity to exploit. In respect of AN, they have misrepresented the situation to talk about AN's losses and the fabricated figures and the selective use of information by the minister and by those documents that have been circulated, particularly by Brew. Brew had a vested interest, which was what was disclosed, and he is happy to withdraw. His report, in my view, was not a report of integrity, was not a report of impartiality and was not a report designed to present the most accurate position and the position of the best interest of this nation and of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at all these things you can see that the government is going for a quick fix here. It is opportunistic. Let us look at it again from the broader view of what is best for Australia and what should be happening in this situation. The national transport planning task force report shows that in 1988&hyphen;89&mdash;these are the latest figures which were available&mdash;on a weight basis rail carried 23 per cent of the transport task in this country, road 74 per cent and sea three per cent, out of a total task of 1,337 million tonnes of goods or freight transported in that year. But, looking at it on a weight&hyphen;distance basis, rail's share rises from 23 per cent to 32 per cent, road's share drops to 33 per cent&mdash;most of road is short haul; it is metropolitan, intra&hyphen;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">urban, intra&hyphen;region&mdash;and sea's share rises from three per cent on a weight basis to 35 per cent on a weight&hyphen;distance or tonne&hyphen;kilometre basis, on a total task of 257 billion net tonne&hyphen;kilometres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at value it all changes again. Seventy three per cent of the expenditure on transport in the years 1988&hyphen;89 went on road, 19 per cent on rail, six per cent on sea and two per cent on air. That is the analysis of the foundation of transport in this nation. This legislation ought to give us the best set of integrated transport arrangements for this country; it should not just opportunistically pluck out information to deal with the situation on a budgetary basis to the exclusion of what is best for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that greatly worries me about all this is this government's ideology. We saw this ideology in the minister's second reading speech when he referred to AN's losses by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To a large extent this situation reflects the fundamental problems arising from government owning and operating businesses that are more efficiently conducted by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is bunkum. It is total misrepresentation. I am sure it was not written within the department. Those words came straight out of the minister's office. Ownership is not the problem&mdash;that is straight ideology; the problem is the nature of the system and the remnants of what was the Australian National Railways Commission and its interstate operations. This government's ideology is to sell it off: whatever it is, sell it. That is the policy of this government. If you can get a buyer, sell it. Based on that ideology, any business that is government owned and operated would be more efficiently conducted by the private sector. Ask some of the Bond shareholders. Ask some of the Alan Bond companies about that bit of ideology. Run through the stock exchange. Ask some of the shareholders in some of the other companies on the stock exchange. Have a look at all ideology about private versus public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another thing that concerns me about the nature of the transport task around the world. In the United States&mdash;the Mecca of free enterprise&mdash;there are two main rail
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5571"> operators in the west and two main rail operators in the east. With rail transport there is a growing tendency toward the provision of point&hyphen;to&hyphen;point services, door&hyphen;to&hyphen;door services. The European Commission is following the same line so that there is an integrated service: transport from one place in one nation to another place in the same nation or from one place in one nation to another place in another nation. A seamless transport system is being provided. It is all linked together. The two largest markets are looking at the integration of rail systems to get economies of scale, efficiencies of management and reliability of service. As I said, efficiency of service and reliability are so important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this country rail is being fragmented. It is a mickey mouse system in comparison with the systems in the United States and Europe and it seems this government is determined to make it a minnie mouse system by fragmenting it into smaller and smaller bits. Sure as night follows day, later on there will be a reconsolidation of rail systems in this country. The system will go back to being a larger system, because that is where efficiency and reliability of service come from. I have a great fear about the direction being followed by this government&mdash;it is simply ideological.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to what should happening, I have explained my concerns about having a series of micro&hyphen;systems when the world is moving to larger and more efficient systems. But the situation in this country will be further exacerbated because this government has a policy of opening up Australian coastal shipping to foreign shipping. The effect is that the cargoes which are being lost to foreign ships operating between Australian ports are not so much cargoes from Australian flag ships; they are cargoes from the National Rail Corporation. Rail and land transport cargoes are being lost to foreign shipowners and Third World seafarers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government does not have a transport strategy. It is operating in isolation on this issue. It is not taking into account other forms of domestic transport or the prospect of integration. The government has another policy which for several years has damaged the Australian railway industry. The target of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Third World seafarers and the foreign shipowners is not so much the Australian coastal shipping scene; the target is to hit the National Rail Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you understand this: effectively, Australian railway workers are being replaced by Third World seafarers. An analysis of the cargoes being carried under single voyage permits has been carried out&mdash;288 such permits have already been granted in the first half of 1996 and we are looking at a figure well in excess of 500 for 1996&hyphen;97. The analysis shows that the cargoes that are being carried are essentially cargoes from east to west and that they are containerised break bulk cargoes, not cargoes that are carried by Australian coastal vessels, which are mostly bulk cargoes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So here is the government's own shipping policy flying in the face of what purports to be its rail policy. That is why I support the amendment that has been put forward by the shadow minister, the member for Melbourne, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"the House declines to give the Bill a second reading until such time as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) the Government develops a coherent policy for the Australian railway industry;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) the government reaches agreement with South Australia and Tasmania on funding assistance for the development of their rail infrastructures;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Remember that in Tasmania the rail system is a fundamental part of their land transport system. I will come back to the amendment in a moment, but it underlines the fact that this government does not have a transport strategy. It has something that it wants to do in rail&mdash;in this case, in this legislation, that is based on an ideology&mdash;and it has something it wants to do, again based on ideology, in shipping, because it hates the membership of the Maritime Union of Australia. It cannot remove its blinkers to see that all of the wiser countries in the Western world are looking to expand their shipping industry because they recognise the value in jobs and financial turnover that comes from all the shore based industries that are associated with your own flag shipping industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5572">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment goes on in part (4) to say that the House declines to give the Bill a second reading until such time as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) the Government guarantees existing passenger service operations and concession arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) the Government guarantees the employment and training of apprentices currently employed by the Australian National Railways Commission until the completion of their contracts;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) the South Australian and Tasmanian Governments have put in place safety and regulatory arrangements for the rail industry;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) the Australian National Railways Commission demonstrates that all employees that have left Australian National since 24 November 1996 as a result of work related illness or injury have been offered a redundancy payment;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The last part deals with the vesting of employer contributions to employees that have left or leave Australian National after 24 November 1996. There are groups of employees, as the shadow minister mentioned earlier, who are not being fairly dealt with in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hopefully, the legislation will be amended in the Senate to make sure that those people are properly dealt with and that they do get a fair go. The other thing that is of great concern is that, in the event of these powers being passed on to the ministers by this legislation, they will not be accountable to the parliament and they will have a power that I think is unprecedented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recommend to members that they look at the report of the national transport planning task force, because it considers what is the best system of transport services for Australia the nation, and it points to the need to improve the efficiency and the linkages between road, rail and sea. It also points out that nothing much has changed. Rail has a natural advantage in about 40 per cent of cargoes; road has a natural advantage in about 40 per cent of cargoes; and there is about 20 per cent that is left to compete in the middle. Overall, we want to see a system that is integrated as a whole. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak in favour of the government's policy of the AN sale. I would like to take up a number of points, if the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris)
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> happens to remain in this chamber, on some of the comments that he made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the comments that I think should be corrected is this notion that this is driven by ideology; he said that we are selling everything. It is interesting that some of the greatest asset sales happened under the previous government&mdash;whether it was Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;having promised the workers of which on numerous occasions that they would not sell&mdash;or whether it is the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member talks about the reforms on the waterfront. An enormous amount of money was spent on waterfront reforms and today our container rate of shifting is still low. Indeed, the government strategy of a more efficient rail system will lead to greater efficiencies and it will lead to greater tonnage coming off roads onto rail and from ships to rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package is part of a $2 billion package. The AN sale is the beginning, and it will then move on to National Rail. The problems with AN today have been created by the previous government when they took out most of the valuable freight assets and put them into National Rail. That is why we have a situation today that we have to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that, as previous coalition speakers have mentioned, the unions support the package, the locals support it, the papers support it and the communities support it. Indeed it just highlights that the ALP are very much out of touch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This $2 billion package comprises: $325 million to the AN restructuring; $50 million to environment work to clean up potential sites; $800 million in retiring debts so that the future buyer of AN&mdash;whether it is as a whole or components of it&mdash;will be unencumbered; a large proportion, $580 million, to superannuation; and $90 million unfunded, which is very different from what the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has been saying in this parliament. There is also a further investment of $175 million in track access. The whole purpose is to develop a system that gives greater competition, greater flexibility and long&hyphen;term job security, and gets the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5573"> politics which have dominated the industry since Federation out of rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that it was the ALP and the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton)&mdash;who, I am delighted to say, is in the chamber&mdash;who left AN in the trouble it is in at the moment. This sale is concentrating on the assets of AN in South Australia and of course Tasrail. As has been mentioned before, in the Brew report&mdash;and, I might add, Brew did not have a vested interest, which aspersion was cast by the member for Shortland&mdash;when NR was established, all of the profitable routes were taken out of AN and it was left with unprofitable routes, enormous debt and an uncompetitive passenger service. As even Senator Collins said, it was doomed from the very day the plan was cooked up. He should know, as a senator from the Northern Territory which has been trying to connect that line from Alice Springs to Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look back at the history of AN and these crocodile tears that are coming from the opposition and to consider that 7,000 jobs were lost in 13 years under Labor. The financial loss of $150 million in 1995&hyphen;96 would continue if nothing was done. In South Australia, AN has $1 billion worth of debt. Indeed, passenger services have diminished and many lines have been closed&mdash;whether to Mt Gambier, Port Augusta, Whyalla or Broken Hill. And of course there is the far less frequent service of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless we do something now it will be a basket case and there will be no hope for those people in South Australia and regional areas. The sale of AN is an integral part of the future rail reform of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment AN has debt of $30,000 per annum per employee. On current forecasts that would move to $220,000 per annum in the next couple of years, if we did nothing. It would be irresponsible of this government not to make the hard decisions that it has made. Even more irresponsible is the opposition's blatant and opportunistic blocking of legislation when even their own workers want it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AN will be sold&mdash;there have been over 50 registered interests&mdash;either with totally vertically integrated components or broken up into parts. It may well be the three passenger
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trains, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ghan</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Overlander</EMPHASIS>. It may well be just the workshops at Whyalla. It may well be just Tasrail, which has worked quite well. Or it may be some of the intrastate tracks in that particular state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, if you look back at the history of AN, it was left in this deplorable state because all the valuable assets were ripped out of it and put into NR. And the member for Shortland stands up here and says that NR is a great success. It is carrying less freight today than it was a year ago. If you talk to the private operators who use it, whether it is SCT, TNT or Patrick, they will tell you it has got worse. At the end of next year when the agreement unwinds&mdash;let us hope that the New South Wales government, which has been dragging the chain on this, comes to the party&mdash;it will be unwound and it will be sold. The deal you put together for National Rail is one in which the Commonwealth has 73 per cent of the equity but only 49 per cent of the voting rights. We never had a chance from day one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look back at the history of rail. Five states have been rail players. When you go back to Federation, part of the problem is that we had three different networks&mdash;the narrow gauge, which is predominantly in Queensland, the standard gauge in New South Wales and WA, and broad gauge in Victoria. As we built the steel highway, this created problems for this country which have been naturally superseded in many areas by road, air or sea freight. The trans&hyphen;Australian railway, which linked Perth to Adelaide and which opened up the west, was completed in 1917. That was one of the carrots that got Western Australia into the federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the Labor government in the 1970s under Whitlam that tried to buy back the rail systems into a Commonwealth system. Only South Australia and Tasmania came to the party. That is why we are trying to sort out that problem now. If all the players had come together, maybe it would have been different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AN is the smallest of the rail operations in Australia. It has a track of about 6,151 kilometres capitalised at around $1.5 billion. VLine has 5,670 kilometres of track in Victoria
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5574"> and moves a smaller amount of freight. Westrail has 5,411 kilometres of track and is capitalised at $6.2 billion. In New South Wales, the old State Rail Authority, which has now been split up, has 8,000 kilometres of track and is capitalised at $15 billion. The big one is in Queensland&mdash;10,000 kilometres of track and capitalised at $26.5 billion&mdash;a vertically integrated railway organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is trying to build an integrated transport policy, particularly with rail. The beginning of this is the sale of AN so we can get greater competition, greater flexibility, better services, lower costs and a more viable operation that does not cost the taxpayer an enormous amount of money and gives hope to communities, particularly in South Australia and Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some salient points made by the previous speaker. Out of capital city areas, rail still accounts for 56 per cent of the non&hyphen;urban land freight. It is still the king of freight outside capital cities relative to trucks, which have 44 per cent of land freight. The trucking industry is seamless and reliable. It has about 20,000 operators, which is good for short haul. Like the trucking industry, there has to be greater competition put in for rail, just as has happened overseas in a number of other countries, particularly New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the success stories is West Coast Rail, which is now running on a private line in Victoria. They have increased services to Warrnambool and a number of other regional communities. They still have difficulties, particularly the interstate operators who are in a partnership&mdash;some of them with National Rail, some of them not. They still have to go through 13 different authorities to move goods from the Port of Fremantle or from Perth through to Adelaide and Melbourne. It is inefficient. To think that the previous speaker was standing up here espousing the efficiencies and the claims of National Rail is quite frightening considering that he was a previous minister for transport in an earlier period of this country's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP's position, particularly with One Nation, was that they directed an enormous amount of money, perhaps with the best of reasons, into rail. They built crossing loops.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Unfortunately, the crossing loops they built are too small now for the superfreighters coming from Brisbane to Sydney. They did not address the problems of congestion, particularly with freight trains in Sydney, where the rail links all hub into that area. They did do some positive things, I will hand them that. The standard gauge that went from Melbourne through to Adelaide was a positive move. But when they created this beast called National Rail, they saw it as their salvation and it just has not stacked up. This government has to clean that up and build so as to have not only some viable private operators but also a national track access regime, and that is what we are building towards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at the United Kingdom. For 120 years prior to 1948 all the railway systems, which were built after the Industrial Revolution, were actually privately owned, and they worked well. Of course, straight after the war when the Labour Party was put back into office it nationalised them all. That has been the case until recently when it was privatised, and that has worked well. The key elements are safety, reliability, lower cost and frequency of service; and this is where rail has not been able to compete, principally in freight but also in passenger services, in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New Zealand had a government owned railway until recently. It has been privatised. Transrail, as it is now called, has a large equity holder called Wisconsin, a major US operator, which came into it. The usual fears were voiced, but there has been a 15 per cent increase in passenger numbers. Instead of making enormous losses, Transrail is making good profits. It is actually building more track, expanding its services and more trains are running on time. That is what privatisation has done for rail in New Zealand. Indeed, the same is the case in the United States where most private operators are moving huge amounts of freight, where there are intermodal ports and where there is road and rail access. The system is seamless and it does not matter how it is transported from A to B as long as it gets there on time. That is where they have been successful.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5575">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is exactly the vision that we want in Australia with rail. That is why the sale of AN is critical. If we do nothing, as has been demonstrated by previous speakers, the losses will accumulate and the services will be cut back even further. AN never had a chance after the main interstate freight assets were taken out of it and transferred to National Rail. It has to be sold. We need to get private operators into those short intrastate lines, those workshops and those icons, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ghan</EMPHASIS> or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS>. They are losing money hand over fist; a private operator is needed in there who can use the services as a torch to attract not only domestic tourists but also foreign tourists. It will be done with government getting out of it. That is exactly the policy that the previous government was advocating when it privatised Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and, no doubt, would have done with Telstra if the now Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, had had his way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the vision, from the sale of AN, is to give a private operator access into this area and then to move on with the sale of National Rail to link up all the rail links&mdash;it is a bit hard in Queensland because of the different gauges but you can get to Brisbane&mdash;and to have private operators running on those lines with equal access for people. We will have a national rail infrastructure entity through which the Commonwealth will still retain control of those main interstate lines and tracks. Even with the sale of AN and the sale of those particular intrastate lines, the Commonwealth will still retain an interest in the actual land that they are built on, and that goes for the state governments as well. That is exactly what the workers want: to be given these opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we look into the future, we will have a viable east-west link where ships will dock in Perth, as they do now&mdash;and the member for Shortland was quite deceptive in what he was saying because ships are doing that now: they are coming into those ports like Perth and they want to&mdash;and their cargoes sent across the Nullarbor. They want to do it with Brisbane and Acacia Ridge, with the rail line put through to Fisherman's Island. Ships want to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dock there, put their cargoes on a train and get them straight through to Brisbane or through to Melbourne, which would be faster than sending a ship around the coast to the Port of Melbourne. Foreign carriers want to do that now. I might add that I got the impression that Australian National Line was held as a shining light in a previous speech today. That has made horrendous losses. It could not be sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the vision is that there will be intermodal ports that will be seamless; that cargo can come into this country, can get off a ship, can get on to a train, can get to an intermodal port and on to a truck or into those particular locations. The vision is the completion of the line from Alice Springs to Darwin, an integration of the rail infrastructure&mdash;which should have been done not just by the previous government but by other governments back through our history&mdash;and a viable transport system from north to south and from east to west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been 50 expressions of interest for AN. This is just the beginning. If this is done right&mdash;and it should be bipartisan because it is ALP supporters who will be the beneficiaries&mdash;there will be new opportunities and new jobs. It is disappointing to hear the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne, say that the only holes that he can put in this legislation concern the way the process has been conducted, not the spirit and the intent of it. I think the shadow minister should take his guide from Tommy the Tank Engine and go back home because he is not making a valuable contribution in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a good package. The government needs the sale of AN. It needs to rebuild, revive and rejuvenate rail not for nostalgic reasons, not for the romance of rail, but to get greater efficiencies, to get cargo off the roads and back on to rail and to get cargo to locations quicker. The way to do that is to sell AN and to give it to private operators. I do not believe, though, that we should have a monopoly situation; we do need to have adequate entrants coming into the market. The next step is track infrastructure and also
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5576"> adequate access rights. That is particularly important. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That says it all. The intellectual fortitude that the government brings to bear in the debate on the rail infrastructure of regional Australia is reduced to Thomas the Tank Engine. It is very sad to bear witness to an attempt by the Liberal government to sell out our national railway. It is the backbone of regional industry in this country, particularly in South Australia and Tasmania. It is very sad to bear witness to yet another attempt by the government to sell out regional Australia&mdash;selling off public assets and adding to the crisis in employment opportunities, particularly in our regional centres in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the evidence of the sell out. We have the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) tripping off to the UK to watch the cricket at Lords. Meanwhile, workers at BHP are still waiting for the Prime Minister to make good his promise to go and talk to them about their concerns and about the lack of a consistent, coherent government industry policy and a steel plan. The minister could not even be bothered to talk to the workers in National Rail as minister. He has been not been to major National Rail workplaces as the shadow minister has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a government getting more workers sacked with this potential sell off of the National Railways Commission. This bill refuses to guarantee existing services. There are at least 2,600 jobs in regional Australia, as well as vital railway services, that are placed at risk by this bill. This does not include all of the other workers who depend on the operation of our railways to keep their jobs. The government does not appear to care that this bill, which is still vague and fuzzy around the edges with regard to the real future of our national railways, is spreading fear and concern amongst railway workers all over Australia. The government is blackmailing battlers in regional areas who have given their lives to maintaining and developing our national railways. It has put a gun to their heads and is threatening to close the lines if the bill does not pass.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of government does this to people&mdash;revelling in the fear that they have been able to generate in the hearts of regional workers? People in regional Australia are being held to ransom by the government on this issue&mdash;support privatisation or you lose your jobs. There is no guarantee that they will keep their jobs if they do support this Liberal government's agenda of privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course there are railway workers who are scared in this environment and of course there are railway workers who are consequently attracted to the minor safety net of privatisation that is brought about under the threat that is perpetrated by this government. Of course there is a minor union that is concerned about the opposition's intention to oppose or to amend this bill. However, the SBU, the single bargaining unit, representing the majority of workers in AN has carried a resolution supporting the opposition's moves to oppose and amend this legislation. The coalition's pontifications about the support it purportedly has from AN workers is absolutely hollow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government plans to make all staff redundant, with the new operators being able to recruit staff as they wish, if they wish. The government has sold these people out without even ensuring that they will be able to get jobs with the new proprietors. The rail unions are asking for continued employment and training of current AN apprentices to the satisfactory completion of their contracts of training without being disadvantaged&mdash;that is, wage maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What undertaking can the government give that this bill will deliver for apprentices? Our young people in regional Australia need jobs. They need careers. They need futures. It is commonly known that there is a crisis of confidence amongst young people in regional Australia. There is a higher incidence of suicide and substance abuse among these people. This bill does nothing to reassure young people in regional Australia of their futures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Railway workers have indicated through their unions that they want to make a labour adjustment program a specific feature of the regional impact fund, with an increase to the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5577"> overall fund to support the workers who will lose their jobs if this bill passes. They are not asking for much&mdash;just to ensure that money will be available to clean up the mess once the Liberals have finished chopping up our railways and just enough money to address some of the economic and social problems that this bill will cause in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of these protections for regional workers and their families are in this bill. But more than that, workers have indicated through their unions that they are concerned not just about their own jobs but the regional economies themselves. They are concerned about the future of Australian railways for all of Australia. This bill will destroy the Australian rail industry as we know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The railway unions have started the fight for all other rail users as well as the workers, including the majority of industry players who move freight by rail and pensioners who travel by train, many people in regional Australia and throughout the land are affected by this bill. The unions have called for guaranteed service levels for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ghan</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Overland</EMPHASIS>, an overhaul of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Overland</EMPHASIS> rolling stock and guaranteed continued concession levels for pensioners on these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where are the guarantees from this government to industry in regional Australia? Where are the guarantees from this government for pensioners who need to rely on rail transport in regional Australia? There are none. This government is seeking to abrogate the responsibility of the parliament to people in regional Australia who rely on rail transportation. The workers have asked for the retention of all services and lines unless there is an independent public inquiry which determines that they can be closed. This already applies in South Australia. But this bill leaves the Tasmanian services and lines unprotected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why will the government not support the opposition's calls for a coherent rail policy? Why will the government not hear the opposition's calls for a coherent steel plan for that matter? Where is the member for the Parkes (Mr Cobb), whose electorate in western New South Wales stands to lose a great deal from his government's actions, in this
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debate? He is silent, complicitly supporting his government's attack on his electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The railway unions have called for a commitment from the government to intrastate rail infrastructure in South Australia and Tasmania and have opposed the sale of track infrastructure. Yet in its rail reform package in November last year the government provided inadequate funding for track upgrading to provide Australia with a decent interstate rail network. Now it has the temerity to turn around and say that this sector is not performing as well as it might. The government are out of touch with regional Australia. They do not know what the needs of regional are. They do not want to spend money to service those needs. Their solution is to sell out and then sell off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government does not understand is that rail is a vital link for Australian travellers and industries. Not everyone can do a John Sharp and jump the queue at the airport; many Australians cannot afford to travel by air. For all Australians an affordable, well&hyphen;maintained and cohesive rail service is essential. It is essential for developing and maintaining regional industries in Australia. Importantly, unions have urged the government to establish regulatory and safety frameworks in South Australia and Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians still remember and mourn the very few accidents we have suffered on our railways. Without adequate regulatory and safety frameworks, how will the government ensure that accidents do not occur? By abrogating the parliament's responsibility to the minister, clearly it cannot. There is no provision for any of these protections for our rail industry in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all of the pitfalls in this bill, all the bits of half&hyphen;thought&hyphen;out material that the government is peddling, the question has to be asked: what is the government attempting to do? John Howard continues to fiddle around while the Treasurer slashes and burns our national railways. He lets his minister for transport run around at the edges, with no idea of how to develop a coherent plan. But is this just incompetence or is it something more sinister? Why can't they tell us what they really want to do? Why release reports bit by bit? Why do they persist in frightening
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5578"> workers in regional areas by not giving them any certainty about what they are going to do with our national railways?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill places our fragile regional economy at risk in places like Port Augusta, where workshops and infrastructure facilities are under severe threat of closure. Closure of workshops at Islington will further reduce the already declining heavy engineering industry in Adelaide, not that this appears to worry the government. I am concerned that those people in regional Australia who looked to the National Party in the hope that in government that party would deliver regional growth have been bitterly disappointed. This bill does nothing for rural Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Railways are commonly in public ownership throughout the world and for good reason. For Australia to sell off its railways in the general economic rationalist agenda that this government is running just does not work, and there will be plenty of people out of work as a consequence. This economic rationalist agenda has failed to provide Australia with a coherent national rail policy. In fact, the economic rationalist agenda underlying this bill reduces any capability we may have of the national rail plan that we in this country need for our future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this bill, our railways will become a weak link in any regional employment or industry strategy. Who then does this economic rationalist agenda serve? This is where we get into the really gory bits. It is clear that it serves one group in this country and one group only. Why else would John Sharp appoint John Brew, who was proposing to act as a consultant to the Great Southern Railway Corporation, formed by the Macquarie Bank to buy and operate AN business, to conduct an inquiry into AN? Why else would the government delay the release of the full report of the Brew report and provide only an edited version of the executive summary of the report nearly three months after the report was provided to the minister for transport?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister for transport maintains that only the edited version of the summary was made available to protect commercial interests. This is Liberal code for protecting the interests of his mates. People in regional
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia should be very worried. Why are the interests of commercial firms more  important to this Liberal government than the interests of workers in our regions? And they are. Why else would the parliamentary secretary to the minister for transport tell the Senate that `no-one should assume the government will be implementing this report in making decisions about the future of the rail industry' when a press release was available which reflected key recommendations of the Brew report the next day?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has sold out the workers in regional Australia. This is a government which is prepared to sacrifice, to offer up, national programs and enterprises which should be owned by all Australians. This is a blood sacrifice that the government is asking people in regional Australia to pay. This is a treachery by the government. The government should be condemned, in my view, by every person in Australia for the sale of AN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of amendments that the opposition are seeking to move to this legislation. I would like to talk about two of them. One is that the government develop a coherent policy for the Australian railway industry. What is wrong with the government developing a coherent policy for the rail industry? Clearly, it is something which is well overdue. A lot has been made by members opposite about difficulties in  performance in rail in Australia. It is well known and documented that rail in Australia has been starved of funds. Certainly, a lack of infrastructure development commitment over many decades by Australian governments of successive orders has meant that it is problematic for rail in Australia to compete in perhaps the way that it might like to and in a way that would be in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course what we have here is a government that is intent on privatisation. After that privatisation regime has been unleashed, it will then release into the sector capital that has been held in abeyance. There has been a capital strike on rail in favour of road transport, in my view, and one that is contrary to the national interest. Regional Australia requires good rail infrastructure. Regional Australian industries require sound rail infra
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5579"> structure. This bill does not guarantee existing services. In the absence of guaranteeing existing services and where there is not a commitment for cross-subsidisation to regional Australia, people in the bush will suffer. Businesses in the bush will suffer. Pensioners who rely on rail transportation will suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also said that the government should guarantee existing passenger service operations and concession arrangements. What is wrong with that? Why can't the government guarantee existing passenger services? Is this really a way of closing down passenger services by stealth&mdash;flog it off and let someone else do your dirty work? It is an outrage. Why not guarantee concession arrangements? What is wrong with ensuring that pensioners can travel about, go and see their kids or their grandchildren by rail? They certainly cannot fly around the place like John Sharp can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A government that is seeking to privatise something, if it can muster the argument, needs to be questioned about why it would want to abrogate the parliament's responsibility and regulation for this sector. It has to justify why it is not guaranteeing existing services. So far, we have not been able to get a single line of rational debate from the government justifying why it should not guarantee services for the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do members of the community expect from the government for paying their taxes? What do they expect from us in this House? They expect good law and services. People in regional Australia particularly rely on things like cross&hyphen;subsidisation. That is at the heart of the debate about telecommunications. If people in regional Australia were paying full market rate for telecommunications that were not cross&hyphen;subsidised by people in the city, the argument is that life would become very difficult for them. The argument with transportation is that if people in regional Australia are not guaranteed services&mdash;if enterprise runs them at full cost recovery&mdash;then the community will become extremely isolated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot is made of the world being a smaller world these days with modern transportation systems. Unfortunately, those in regional Australia&mdash;the people in the bush&mdash;are going to find that the world is becoming a larger
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> place not a smaller place. It is going to be harder for them to get around and harder for business to freight their materials around because they will not be cross&hyphen;subsidised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increased urbanisation in this country has been the subject of a lot of research and discussion and, ultimately, debate in this parliament. In my view, increased urbanisation will continue not only unabated but hell for leather. People will continue to leave regional centres and the bush in general for the cities at a greater rate of knots when jobs disappear. Jobs will disappear when enterprise in regional Australia&mdash;business in the bush&mdash;goes bust because of the increase in cost of transporting products to cities and, ultimately, overseas. That oncost for doing business in the bush has to essentially be reliant upon an adequate national infrastructure, and this bill is about destroying that national infrastructure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill 1997 is a very important piece of legislation that the House is debating today. The debate, which I have been listening to this morning, has been wide ranging. I think it is important that we focus on some of the key elements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the name Australian National belies what it does. Australian National does not operate rail nationally around Australia. The previous speaker, the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), said that it services all of regional Australia. It does not. It does not service my part of Australia in the state of New South Wales or Queensland. The previous speaker's comments about the operation of rail in Australia, particularly the subsidies and cross&hyphen;subsidies within the passenger systems, should have been directed to some of his colleagues in the New South Wales government because of the way the rail operation is running in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the bill is to allow the sale of the non-interstate main line track rail assets of Australian National. Australian National operates SA Freight and Tasrail within the states of South Australia and Tasmania respectively, the Seat of Government Railway, contract rail and engineering services, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ghan</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Overland</EMPHASIS>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5580"> passenger trains. It is interesting to note a bit of the history&mdash;what is happening and how the government arrived at the decision to sell Australian National, which has put this bill before the House. The history of government ownership of railways in Australia has seen declining work forces, declining market share and spiralling debts. That is not just a comment limited to this debate and to this particular rail operation. It is across the board. Government ownership has resulted in political intervention in the rail industry to the detriment of its long-term viability. It has allowed government owned rail operations to behave as monopolistic providers of services, inflexible in their practice and unresponsive to the needs of the customer. Again, I note that the state Labor government in New South Wales is grappling with this same problem with its state rail operation and the costs. The rail industry needs 10&hyphen;, 20&hyphen; or 30&hyphen;year planning horizons, and this has not been achieved where short&hyphen;term political ends have dictated investment decisions, rail operations and reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition was elected to government with a commitment to reform not only the rail industry as part of the transport sector but also the overall transport sector. I think the National Commission of Audit identified to the Commonwealth government that reform in the transport sector of the economy could produce a massive improvement in real terms to the GDP of this nation&mdash;road, rail, sea and air, all those elements of transport. This government is about reviewing and reforming all those elements of the transport network in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition that is before the House today is a result of some of the decisions of the previous government and of the review undertaken&mdash;the Brew report to government, particularly about AN. The Labor Party's history of ownership of AN is not very good at all. It is a history of job losses, line closures, lost freight and spiralling debt. The Labor Party told the AN work force that all was well and that they would all have jobs for the future in AN. Yet the Labor Party secretly signed off on hundreds of rail jobs and approved business plans that would see further
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> service reductions and job losses. Yet the AN commission itself knew that this was not true and the chairman advised the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) on his coming to office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government was overseeing a declining service, spiralling debt and a government business enterprise that was getting itself into a lot more strife&mdash;as did ANL. We know the history of ANL. The former government tried to sell it, and could not. The taxpayers of Australia poured hundreds of millions of dollars into it. As a country, we are getting into the same situation with this particular government business enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to be realistic. Opposition speakers this morning have spoken about the jobs that are there and the jobs in regional Australia. What this government is trying to do is secure those jobs before they are all gone and beyond redemption&mdash;absolutely beyond redemption. Sadly, that is about where ANL is today: beyond redemption. At great taxpayer expense, we had the appointment of special consultants to try to salvage ANL&mdash;but it just did not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government now know that they should have acted sooner&mdash;and so they should have. The previous government probably reckon that they did fairly well, considering the different elements of their political party, in getting away with some of the privatisation exercises that they undertook whilst in office. In this and other debates in this place, we have listened to speaker after speaker commenting on track records and speaking with shock&hyphen;horror about the economic rationalist view of privatisation and what it will do and saying that, under the coalition government, it will just be a scorched earth policy of privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday in this chamber during a division, it flashed up to me that it was interesting to note the argy-bargy that occurred between both sides of politics about the division and who should be crossing the floor, who should be sitting wherever and the control being exercised by different political parties in this place. I remembered&mdash;as you will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;the division that took
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5581"> place in this House under the previous government on the sale of the second half of the Commonwealth Bank. You will recall that the very last thing the government of the day wanted was to have a division in this House on the sale of the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, a division did occur because two members who used to sit here in these seats, the then member for Wills and the then member for North Sydney, called a division to highlight&mdash;and particularly the former member for Wills&mdash;to the people of Australia the bleeding hearts in the left wing of the Labor party who were all voting to sell the Commonwealth Bank. They were voting to sell the Commonwealth Bank; and they had voted to sell Qantas, they had voted to sell Australian Airlines, they had voted to sell CSL and they had voted to sell our share in the Snowy Mountains scheme and a whole raft of government enterprise businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet it is amazing how short that road to Damascus is and how quick the conversion takes place when flicked back onto the other side of the House. All of a sudden they are anti-privatisation&mdash;it is the dogma of the economic rationalists; it has nothing to do with good management. It was all to do with good management when the Labor Party were in government, but it has nothing to do with good management of government business enterprises today. That is the Labor Party that is opposing this bill today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing that the coalition has always been consistent about&mdash;and this has included 13 years of opposition whilst the Labor Party was running this country, and running a similar agenda as far as the management of government business enterprises was concerned&mdash;has been the privatisation of government business enterprises and assets that were not seen as a core responsibility or activity of government. In this, we consistently supported that government then. We had some credibility on this issue in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put to it you: the Labor Party did not, and does not, have any credibility in this debate. It does not. I have the greatest of respect for the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). But when the former government sold the first half of the Commonwealth Bank, they signed
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> off on the prospectus and said that the remaining shares of the Commonwealth Bank would remain in public ownership. If it were a private operation that had been putting out that prospectus, then surely there would be some prudential rule somewhere that would call that statement into question. But the former government just went straight over the top of that&mdash;`we're selling the other half'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That particular division yesterday was interesting to note. It just brought back to my memory that other particular division in this place when the government members and opposition members all sat over there, supporting the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, and we had a couple of Independents here. As for the members of the left wing of the Labor Party, where were they? They were over there. They did not even go outside of the doors. That is how much control was exercised by the government of the day. They did not even leave the chamber and abstain; they were in here voting to sell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of this government business enterprise is based on the fact that we want to maintain those jobs with AN. We want to give those people the opportunity to keep working in the rail industry. These employees were based in this diabolical situation with this government business enterprise as a result of the Brew report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brew report revealed some appalling mismanagement, as well as the fact that over 13 years 7,000 jobs had been lost out of AN. Who was in government? The Labor Party. Fifty per cent of the SA rail network was closed and ripped up&mdash;ripped up. If we have any chance of resurrecting rail in Australia as a major element of its transport infrastructure, how will we do it when the rail lines have been ripped up? Then there is a $1 billion debt, with no way of servicing it. Passengers rail services to Mount Gambier, Burra, Peterborough, Port Augusta, Whyalla and Broken Hill are all closed. Also, there is a reduction in the frequency of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> services and the closure of the trans-Australian rail service, a train that operated Adelaide-Perth and that supplemented the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS>, which operates Sydney-Perth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5582">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brew report revealed that an AN employee was being subsidised by the taxpayers of Australia to the tune of $30,000 per annum, with this increasing to $220,000 per annum if nothing was to be done. What the Brew report did identify was that there was no do nothing option. There was no `do nothing' option, which is being proposed in the amendment that has been put forward by the shadow minister&mdash;a do nothing option. The Brew report indicated that that option did not exist; that, to be a responsible government, we had to do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the attached correspondence from Brew to the minister, he quoted that `in comparative terms, the overall loss and debt position of the ANR is four to five times that of the Australian National Line'&mdash;which the previous government attempted to sell and could not. I repeat: four to five times. So why did the previous government not take any action on this, apart from ripping up line and ripping up jobs? The question is still unanswered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This financial year ANR's total losses is likely to exceed $130 million and there is no prospect of it making a profit in the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He later said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The situation has been deteriorating for some time and the Department of Transport in 1992 and again in 1995 provided formal advice to the then government and suggested urgent action was needed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">No do nothing option&mdash;`urgent action was needed'. Was there any urgent action? No. We all know that there certainly was not. That has been highlighted in that report to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to note in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> that one of the actions the previous government did take as far as AN was concerned and the reshuffling of the Commonwealth's involvement in rail when setting up National Rail was to hive off a lot of profitable sectors to National Rail. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> indicates that the loss of primary business from Australian National to the freight carrier National Rail has impacted heavily on Australian National to the point that debt levels in the structure of Australian National had to be addressed. That is exactly what we are doing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are addressing a chronic situation in an attempt to save taxpayers' money and to try to secure the remaining jobs of those people with Australian National in the rail industry. If we take the do nothing option of the shadow minister, there will be no chance of any redemption of those jobs. The people who currently have those jobs recognise that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister was reported in a radio interview in South Australia recently as stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was indicated to me in advance that the majority of workers there were of the view that the sale should now proceed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The compere said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So given what the workers have said to you today that they would like to see the sale proceed and get it over and done with. Is that likely to change your opposition to the sale at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The shadow minister, Mr Tanner, replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, it is a factor in our consideration but . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The compere said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are not inclined to pull back at all.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The shadow minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, that is right. Some put that view others didn't. We have got plenty of other workers in other parts of the organisation with a different view. We have also got to take into account the interests of the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I remind the shadow minister of that comment that he made; that we also have to take into consideration the views of the taxpayer. That is exactly right. There are the jobs that are involved that need to be secured for the future of AN and there is also the interests of the taxpayers. The taxpayers at the moment are sinking a lot of money into keeping AN in public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are fairly salutary comments by the shadow minister, who has come in here and moved a do nothing amendment. Anybody who has taken any time to investigate the situation of AN is recommending against the do nothing option. He highlights in that interview that we have to take into account not only the workers' views but also the views of the taxpayers. That is exactly what the government is doing. We are looking after the interests of the taxpayers and the interests of the workers of AN. They want that locked in. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5583">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was another radio interview with Mr Len Scharenberg regarding the shadow minister's visit to South Australia. The newsreader said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rail Unions say they're worse off after a meeting with the Federal Opposition's Shadow Transport Minister in Port Augusta on the future of Australian National. Lindsay Tanner has met about 50 workers. The Federal Opposition has threatened to block the sale of AN, but Len Scharenberg of the Australian Workers Union says that means no job guarantees for the workers. He says the opposition has turned its back on rail workers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Len Scharenberg went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After a fair bit of soul searching we, the majority of the workers in Port Augusta, had agreed to a sale, we see that as the best way to keep the workshops viable, and then to see our own people coming out and endorsing the blocking of the sale, it sort of left us with a bit of egg on our face.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I suppose when he is talking about `our own people', he is talking about the Labor Party, the people who are supposed to protect the jobs of workers in Australia. They are not. Their own blue collar work force that supports the Labor Party can see it. Why can the shadow minister not see it? He just cannot see it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the evidence, all the inquiries that have been undertaken that are before the House and the public in this debate indicate that the government is taking the right path with regard to the sale of AN. The only people who cannot see it and who will not see it are the opposition, the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of AN is supported by everyone except the Australian Labor Party. It is supported by the AN workers. It is supported by a petition to the Senate signed by 120  workers of AN at Port Augusta. It is supported by the customers of AN. It is supported by the South Australian and Tasmanian governments, but not the South Australian opposition parties. They are not supporting it; they are in bed with the Commonwealth opposition parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale is supported by the Australian Rail Association. The sale is supported by Rail 2000. The sale is supported by the AN commission and management itself. The sale is supported by National Rail. Why will the Labor Party not support it? Because they have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> become a populist party. That is all they have become. They have junked their commitment to reforming Australia to take Australia in a healthy state beyond the year 2000. They have junked all of that to become a populist party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do the Labor Party want to continue their appalling record as far as AN is concerned? They have locked themselves into becoming the populist party of Australia. We used to think it was only the Democrats that took on that mantle, but now the Australian Labor Party have joined them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to some comments made by the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who is also the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Micro&hyphen;economic Reform. The member referred to the terms of reference that our committee has received from the minister with regard to rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those terms of reference include a report to this House on the reform of rail in Australia and the best way to go. This is the commitment that this government has to rail in Australia and the future of rail in Australia, along with the commitment the government wants to make to the workers of AN to secure their jobs in the future in the rail industry and the commitment that the government wants to make to the taxpayers of Australia to ensure that all government business enterprises are run in a commercial fashion and that we are not wasting taxpayers' money on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are prepared to make the hard decisions, we are prepared to debate them in this place, but we are not prepared to go down the populist lines that the Labor Party have gone down on this issue and a number of other issues since they have become the opposition in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia.

It was an attempt at populism catering to what the Labor Party sees as a ground swell of support&mdash;support, I can tell you, that is simply not there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to the debate on the railway, having lived for years alongside the track and having worked as a fettler on the railway back in the days when Australian National was owned by Charlie Ryan, I have some interest in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth about Australian National is that it was probably the best run railway in Australia, certainly up until the time that Julian Grill became the Minister for Transport in Western Australia and reformed the Western Australian railways, which would now arguably be the most efficient railway system in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Chairman of Australian National was a Don Williams, who was a brilliant, dynamic engineer. He had visions for rail transport across Australia and he wanted Australian National to take over that rail transport. But apart from being a brilliant engineer, Don Williams was also a bit on the arrogant side and certainly did not tolerate fools gladly. It was for this reason that he was totally unacceptable to the railway system of Victoria, which was hopeless, and New South Wales, which, while being very large, was also moribund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was quite clear that those states were never going to countenance an amalgamation or a takeover by Australian National, so the government of the day was forced into another alternative and set up the National Rail Corporation. The problem was that, having set up the National Rail Corporation, it then took from Australian National a lot of its equipment and all of its business, leaving Australian National with all its debts. Australian National had no way of servicing its commitments and it had no option other than to go broke and become a big burden on the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be made very clear that the failure of Australian National had nothing to do with the workers. The workers of Australian National were, in my view, long&hyphen;suffering and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committed and were given a very, very poor deal. There is absolutely no doubt that the failure of Australian National lies with the actions of the previous government, and it gives me no great pleasure to say that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no job guarantees, contrary to what the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), who spoke before me, said. The act says that all staff will be made redundant and must reapply for their jobs with whoever purchases Australian National, or parts of Australian National. I believe it will be sold in parts because I cannot see anyone wanting to take up the whole lot. But still, it is a much better option than no jobs at all, which is the only other option I can see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a flaw in the government's bill, that is, as I see it, it will make Australian National simply a custodian of the permanent way. It will be responsible for maintenance of the permanent way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You simply cannot maintain a permanent way unless you have rolling stock. Right now, service development is being impeded on the trans line because Australian National do not have the wherewithal to carry their requirements for maintenance. So I think it would be very wise for the minister to amend the act to allow Australian National to still have some motive power of its own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This could be done if they were to use the services offered by Aries Engineering in Perth, who have developed a high rail system where they use a truck&mdash;in this case, a Kenworth truck&mdash;which can move on and off the rail in two minutes and is capable of hauling up to 1,000 tonnes. It recently did shunt tests in Kalgoorlie where it successfully shunted very large loads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This system would be ideal for Australian National, and they want it. They have their rest centres set in place along the trans line and they could use this assembly in the same way that they used their sugar train in the past, which was called `the bomber going the other way'&mdash;a slow goods train used for stopping at the various sidings to service those sidings and to also carry the equipment needed for maintenance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5585">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge the minister to not listen to the vested interests that want to keep this at a distance and would encourage Australian National to acquire this equipment available from Aries Engineering in Perth. There is one problem at the moment. To test this equipment, the company is required by some law to have $100 million of public indemnity insurance and a second policy of $20 million which appears to me to be for the same thing. This might be all right to impose on a rail system hauling large trains continually but, for someone running test operations, it is obviously a nonsense. It is a fiction which could easily be overcome if they agreed to have this operating under the existing insurance of Australian National or if they were to apply the same sort of insurance that this assembly would need to have it worked on the roads, where the risk is much greater. To have that in there is either incompetence on the part of the bureaucracy or a clear attempt by the bureaucracy to stop this very worthwhile development happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from enabling access to the permanent way for maintenance purposes, there is also a local service commitment. I was involved in the opening up of the Nullarbor for pastoral industry&mdash;the last great pastoral development that will ever take place in Australia. When those stations were started, there was a clear guarantee that they would be serviced by Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequent decisions, taken mainly at government level, made it simply uneconomical for Australian National to want to service the intrastate positions. If Australian National were to reinstate this truck&hyphen;powered tea and sugar train or bomber train, it would also be able to service those sidings once more. I looked at the figures recently. On the Nullarbor, where pastoralists have an urgent need to de&hyphen;stock some of their properties which have excess stock, it is simply uneconomical at the moment to ship them to the only market, in Peterborough in South Australia. This could be accomplished by a vehicle powered by the Aries concept much more efficiently and cheaply than the railways could possibly do it in their present set&hyphen;up. It would serve a very useful purpose in terms of land care on
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Nullarbor and it would certainly help to make those places viable&mdash;places for which I believe the government has an absolute responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter that concerns me is this: we are told that Australian National will be the custodian of the permanent way and people will be allowed access to the permanent way. I think this is a good idea. But what we see happening already&mdash;and I cannot get answers from the minister's office&mdash;is that people are saying, `Yes, we want to use the permanent way for haulage.' One company in Kalgoorlie wishes to haul limestone into Kalgoorlie for the mining industry. Some of this would be made into lime and some would simply be crushed and used as an alkaline reagent in some of the processes. The company has already put in an order for railway equipment. It has already put in an order for a loco which it is seeking to buy from a state rail system. It is being hampered in getting access to the railway system. I suspect this is because of vested interests. If it is not, the only other explanation can be bureaucratic obfuscation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the minister has an absolute responsibility to consider this application now and let these people get on with what looks to me to be a very viable and worthwhile operation&mdash;an operation which will cost the government nothing. They will pay for access to the railway. That access must involve reasonable fees. It certainly must be no more than the large companies pay. But it will help to support the gold industry, which is very important to Australia. It will help to support employment and it will help to keep the railways viable. I simply need to know why it is not happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing that must be done immediately is that we must stop the destruction of existing carriages. I know there are tenders now being put out for the acquisition of stock carrying carriages which were probably destined to be scrapped. I believe this must be stopped until we assess the need for these carriages. Refurbishment would obviously be a much better option than building new equipment. It would be scandalous if we allowed these carriages to be scrapped by any railway system in Australia until there was a clear
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5586"> understanding of the need for this equipment. So many times in the past we have scrapped perfectly good equipment and then put out tenders to buy new stuff. I certainly hope that does not happen on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian National is very important to Australia. It links east and west. It is the link that is capable of taking traffic off the Great Eastern Highway. The Great Eastern Highway, from Kalgoorlie to Perth, is already overcrowded. We now have B&hyphen;doubles and road trains operating beyond Northam. I believe there will be a serious accident there. I have driven along that road and I felt intimidated by some of these convoys of vehicles. It is much better to have them on the rail. It is also much safer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must look at railways. The government says it has an absolute commitment to rail. Rail is triumphant over long distances, particularly on flat terrain. That is the nature of Australia. Australia, more than any other country, is made for rail. I refer particularly to east&hyphen;west routes. It must be remembered that east&hyphen;west rail routes in Australia have generally been profitable. The massive losses have been on north&hyphen;south routes. The reason is that for the last 70 years governments have not bothered to keep up the infrastructure on those lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear from the government how efficient road transport is compared with rail transport. Road transport has a clear advantage because the government charges an excise on fuel. It charges that partly for the construction of roads, so heavy trucks using roads get some benefit from the excise. All the reports have shown that it is large trucks that do the damage to bitumen roads, not motor cars. So the motorists subsidise the trucking industry on the road; the truck industry gets a benefit from the excise, some of which does go into roads. But railways pay that excise, too, and railways do not get anything like the benefit. The railway has to pay for every centimetre of its permanent way; it has to pay the full cost. Quite clearly, this needs to be looked at if we are going to have a truly level playing field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that this legislation needed to be brought before the House. However,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quite clearly, it was needed. I say to the minister that there must be some competition. I believe Australian National could provide that competition with the National Rail Corporation. I believe Australian National can provide the intrastate services to which the government should have an absolute commitment. I believe it has a duty to provide those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Passenger trains could expand their services enormously if there were some intelligent promotion of tourism. Passenger trains would benefit from having two classes of travel&mdash;first&hyphen;class, which would be very good, and the price would need to go up, and a real steerage class which could provide competitive rates for backpackers to cross Australia. In my view, that class of travel would need to be quite basic in order to keep the cost down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I do urge the minister's office to take heed of what I have said. There are enormous achievements and developments that can take place. They will not take place if it is left to rail, because rail is totally stultified at the moment. They are frightened to do anything. The people of Australian National have actually told me that. They simply dare not make decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the minister's office has to show that leadership, give access to people who will not access the permanent way and certainly amend the legislation to allow Australian National to keep some locomotive power of its own so that it can be self-sufficient in providing for the maintenance of the permanent way. After all, if that job is not kept up or it is forced into using expensive contract services, it will not be long before we are back in this House bemoaning once more the problems of Australian National and seeking even more privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that for railways like this the permanent way should at least be in the hands of the government, and I think the maintenance of it is obviously better provided for in the main by employees employed by Australian National rather than contract teams. I say that with some experience, having worked on the railways and seeing the contract teams in specific areas, but in general maintenance I think it is going to be in Australian National's

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANR's total loss is likely to exceed $130 million&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">we subsequently found that it was more than that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and there is no prospect of it making a profit in the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I make the observation that, if you look back over the last decade and you look at the parliamentary reports, as far back as 1988 a parliamentary inquiry of that era made it quite clear that they expected AN to be breaking even within the next three or four years: that is, by the early 1990s, Australian National should have been in the position to be breaking even.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting that in the AN annual report of 1995-96 there is a deliberate act by the Labor government to defer all of this to post-March 1996, post the election. The blatant irresponsibility of that action in itself indicates the Labor Party's inability to come to terms with reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a representative of a federal electorate my responsibility is to the people of that electorate. It is well known that the seat of Grey has been a Labor seat for many decades, up until 1993. The city of Port Augusta was known as a traditional Labor city. When I was first elected, I did not receive a particular swing in that city, and I would not have expected to. The traditional party lines were drawn, and it is much the status quo. But, as I became familiar with my role as a representative, I became far too familiar with the neglect of rail by the Labor Party. I could not believe that something could have been left to stagnate in the way that Australian National was. Brew makes the comment that `the decisions that Labor made with the Australian National Railway and the National Rail Corporation meant, in effect, death by a thousand cuts' for Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to my theme of representing people. The people of Port Augusta should never have been placed in that position over many years. As people who have got out of the rail industry over the last year or two have said to me, nobody should be treated like that, with that sort of uncertainty. You either have a positive future and look forward with a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5588"> growing industry or you at least hold the status quo. You just do not leave an organisation there hanging out to dry. That is effectively what the government did to Australian National. Brew makes the following point:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The situation has been deteriorating for some time and the Department of Transport in 1992 and again in 1995 provided formal advice to the then Government and suggested urgent action was needed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government ignored that advice. I come to today's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Transcontinental&hyphen;Port Augusta</EMPHASIS> , written after the visit by the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). The Transcontinental's headline reads: `Too little, too late&mdash;Delays surrounding AN's sale costing contracts says workers'. There we have it: an epitaph for the Labor Party written by its own supporters. An article by Ben Osborne in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Transcontinental&hyphen;Port Augusta</EMPHASIS>  today, Wednesday, 18 June 1997 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One worker said the doubt surrounding AN's future had recently cost it a contract with BHP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"They looked at us and said no, we don't know if you have a future so they gave it to someone else," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Who did they give it to?" Mr Tanner asked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"NRC and Goninan's&mdash;the one you mongrels set up," the worker replied.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There we have it once again: AN laid out as a sacrificial lamb. That is what Mr Tanner had to confront at Port Augusta this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government, confronted with those realities, had no choice but to act. In November 1996 it introduced a $2 billion package to revive the rail industry in Australia. That package, as has been said by previous speakers, comprises: redundancies, $112 million; superannuation, $580 million; outstanding contracts and liabilities, $125.7 million; assumption of the AN debt, $779.4 million; regional systems package, $50 million; environment clean&hyphen;up, $50 million; establishment of the National Track Authority, $161 million; AN subsidy, $30 million; unfunded provisions, leave and workers comp, $90 million; and other costs&mdash;that is, managing the sale&mdash;$8 million. The business of cleaning up after Labor and putting rail onto a new path was no easy matter.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, I say to the parliament and to the community generally that the only people who are not supporting the sale of AN are the Labor Party. The supporters of the sale obviously are the Commonwealth; the South Australian government; the Tasmanian government; AN management; the AN Commission; the Australian Rail Association; Rail 2000; National Rail and its managing director, Mr Vince Graham; customers of AN, including the Australian Wheat Board, the Australian Barley Board, SA Cooperative Bulk Handling and the South Australian Farmers Federation; the Mayor of Port Augusta, Joy Baluch; the corporation of the city of Port Augusta; the Northern Regional Development Board; the Spencer Regional Development Association; the Australian Workers Union in Port Augusta&mdash;and, may I add, the Trades and Labour Council in Port Augusta; and, most importantly, the men and women employed by AN in Port Augusta, Islington, Port Pirie, Port Lincoln, Ceduna&mdash;throughout South Australia&mdash;and Tasmania. The only opposition, as I said, is from the shadow minister and the Labor Party. I do not think they have even started to understand the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to share with the House Mr Tanner's comments when he was interviewed on ABC Radio 5CK. When asked whether Labor's position would change if it was clear that workers wanted to see AN sold, Mr Tanner said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly we will be taking close account of the work force's view and the union's view, but we also have other responsibilities . . . responsibilities to taxpayers ultimately as well.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How about that? He suddenly remembered the taxpayers. His government has cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by absolutely absurd bad management. Anyway, he ultimately remembered the taxpayers. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the views of the work force are a critical component in influencing our overall decision, but they're not the only component.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was indicated to me in advance that the majority of workers in Port Augusta were of the view that the sale should now proceed, much as they don't like it, but they feel they need to be put out of their misery, and I think that probably was accurate . . .
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5589">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The interviewer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given what the workers have said to you today, they would like to see the sale proceed, yet it is over and done with. Is that likely to change your opposition to the sale at this stage?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the key answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ah, no, it's a factor in our consideration, but ah . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The interviewer later said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the workers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">don't feel like you're prolonging the agony.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And the reply:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oh I think some people possibly do have a view that Labor should get out of the road . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Exactly! Labor Party: get out of the road and let us get on with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to remind the House of the facts about AN. The losses in 1995&hyphen;96 were $250 million. The debts stand at $800 million. Employment has collapsed by 7,000 jobs over the past 13 years; you do not have to be Einstein to work out who was in government over the last 13 years. Since 1991, 4,300 of the 6,000 jobs have been lost. Fifty per cent of SA's rail network was closed by Labor and ripped up. The passenger services&mdash;Mount Gambier, Burra, Peterborough, Port Augusta, Whyalla and Broken Hill&mdash;have all been closed. The list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will address the issue of the apprentices. It is expected that there will be fewer than 50 apprentices who have not completed their training at the time the sale is finalised and redundancies are offered. A number of organisations have indicated an interest in taking the apprentices on, including the Spencer Gulf training group and similar schemes in metropolitan Adelaide. The new owner will be keen to employ apprentices, particularly those whose training is more advanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House, the nation and the communities of Port Augusta and metropolitan Adelaide can be assured that both the Commonwealth and the state governments will be seeking to ensure that young people still being trained will not be disadvantaged by the sale. I repeat: they will not be disadvantaged by the sale. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to the conclusion of my comments on this sad and sorry business. I can only plead to the Labor Party&mdash;I refuse to beg&mdash;because their conduct does not require me to do other than to put the facts before them and say, for the interests of the people of Port Augusta and the people of South Australia, I ask you to proceed with this legislation posthaste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not wish you to, because of your conduct, get benefit from it, but I say to you in the national interest&mdash;remembering what the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) said to me about the transport task and the future of rail&mdash;that the future of rail can be quite dynamic. There is a great future for the rail industry of Australia. We need to give it the dynamism, the strength, the private enterprise ethic and the investment to enable it to perform the transport task for the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been much discussion since 1915&mdash;even in the last decade and in recent weeks&mdash;about the Alice-Darwin railway. I think it was Senator Bob Collins who said in the 1993 election, `No-one believes us anymore because, every time someone says they are going to build the Alice-Darwin railway before the election, they renege on it afterwards. So no-one really takes us too seriously.' We know the previous Prime Minister Paul Keating was not a fan of that railway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, there is a growing body of opinion and growing body of evidence which will make that rail a viable concern. I have always been one who said that it could only be a viable concern if it were based on a properly structured rail industry. This gives us the opportunity to have a properly structured rail industry which will enable projects like the Alice-Darwin line to proceed for the national good and for the good of the export industries of Australia particularly and to assure the jobs of people throughout South Australia and Australia linked particularly to the export production but also directly to the rail industry and associated industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my final minute or two I say that, over my four years in the parliament, I have great respect for the rail industry and for those people who work in it. It is a tough industry. I am used to working with heavy equipment
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5590"> and I am used to working with my hands, but the rail industry is all heavy equipment and it requires particular skills to operate in an effective, efficient and safe manner. I have nothing but respect for those forebears and for those people who currently work in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In no way can those people who work in the industry now and those who have recently left the industry be held responsible for what has happened. It has been the poor leadership of government which has led us to this situation. Therefore, with the new coalition government's proposals we will go forward into the 21st century with a strong rail industry, which I will be proud to support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is somewhat ironic that we are discussing the Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill here today because 142 years ago in September 1855 the first rail journey occurred in Australia between Sydney and Parramatta. The railway was then owned by the government. It was only because the private consortium called the Sydney Railway Co. had gone bankrupt that the government had to step in and take it over. Today we are debating doing the reverse because the government has gone bankrupt. We are going to hand it back to private enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides a flexible framework to sell all of Australian National's assets, except the interstate main line track. AN, as previous speakers have said, operates the interstate rail passenger services as well as the South Australian freight within South Australia and Tasrail freight within Tasmania. National Rail, which handles the interstate freight, commenced operations in February 1993. It was hived off by the previous government, which set up AN as it exists today to fail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we are going to hand AN over to a new rail operator completely free of debt. It is interesting to look at the Brew report that was set up by the present Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) after we came to government. The present minister has done a magnificent job in this area. The Brew report revealed that a scandal had taken place in this country that had been covered
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up. We were left with massive debt and this story was hidden from the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The story of AN is a history of mismanagement by the previous minister, as he has mismanaged the aviation industry in this country in the past and also ANL, our shipping line. We have had to start to sort out those areas as well. It just goes to show that the previous government could not handle money and could not run a business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Transport and Regional Development had advised the previous minister in 1992 and 1995 to do something and he did nothing. On coming to government we were landed with debts in excess of $1,000 million&mdash;an outrageous situation! He told us that for the last year&mdash;that is, 1995-96&mdash;AN would lose probably $25 million. What did we find when the figures came in? Debt for that year alone of about $250 million. This is for an organisation that runs only three trains for heaven's sake&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> between Sydney and Perth, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ghan</EMPHASIS> between Adelaide and Alice Springs, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Overlander</EMPHASIS> between Melbourne and Adelaide. That is the sort of debt it has been clocking up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brew report showed that the average debt per employee was about $30,000 per year. If things were left running as they were, that debt would have amounted to about $220,000 per employee by the year 2000&mdash;incredible! Already the accumulated losses per employee is of the order of $415,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workshops were overstaffed by about tenfold. We have 500 people in some workshops with work for only 50. They had 230 carriages when they needed about 140. The saddest situation of all was what had happened to jobs. When we handed it over in 1983, there were about 10,500 employed with Australian National. Today it is about a third of that, about 3,500 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a shocking situation all round. We have a declining work force, a declining market share and spiralling debt. If we go back a few years to 1971-72 and look at the figures for market share, the Sydney&hyphen;Melbourne run had 48 per cent of the freight. Today it is about 22 per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5591">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of all that we have had a series of inappropriate government interventions which led to decisions being taken for short-term political ends rather than a long-term vision. We have ended up with a monopolistic provider of service with inflexible practices which are unresponsive to the needs of the customer and an organisation which is starved of capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution to all that is to get the government out of both the passenger side as well as the freight side, which will come later, and get private enterprise in. You can inject capital into the areas that need it. You can bring in expertise. You can bring in new ideas and you can bring in enthusiasm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a pipedream; it has been done on virtually every other continent of the world, except possibly Africa and the Antarctica where they do not run trains. It has been done in Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, Asia, South America and even our near neighbour New Zealand, where you virtually cannot get into second gear and you are running up against the coastline because of the small size of the country. New Zealand has turned a deficit of $150 million around to a profit of $50 million or more in the short few years since it has been privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those other areas, private operators have taken over moribund rail operations, reopened old lines and constructed new lines. Freight tonnages are up. There has been a focus on customer service and new jobs have been created. It has been done in New Zealand and it has been done elsewhere and we are going to do it in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government was in power for 13 years. In that time 7,000 jobs went and it created a $1 billion debt. There was no way to service the debt. Also, 50 per cent of the South Australian rail network was ripped up or closed down. It closed quite a number of passenger rail services. One of them ran in my electorate between Adelaide and Broken Hill. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> services were wound down. It closed the Trans-Australian rail service, which supplemented the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS>. So it is a sad story overall.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We found when we took over AN that it was a bit like the Labor Party after 13 years: bankrupt and moribund&mdash;an incredible legacy. We have decided to pay off the debt, to bring in private enterprise, to create a single entity to control and manage access in a non-discriminatory way to the line and virtually to operate interstate passenger and, later on, freight services similar to the way the roads are run now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government owns the roads, but anybody who has got proper licensing can have access to the roads. We have done it with roads. We have been doing it for hundreds of years. Why cannot we do it with rail? It is an unremarkable thing to do in that sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as paying off debt goes, there is quite a bit to pay off. The restructuring costs are going to amount to $344.4 million. There is an interest bill of $9.1 million. We are injecting $20 million in regional assistance because of the restructuring that will take place. We are going to upgrade the track at a cost of $175 million. We will give AN a subsidy of $30.1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale management costs will amount to something of the order of $8 million. We are going to acquire the AN debt of $779.4 million&mdash;that figure has risen since then. We will pay out all the superannuation of $580 million, although that may have fallen somewhat since that figure was given out. We have had to find a total of over $1,900 million over and above the black hole figure that was in the budget to get the federal rail system in this country up and in a respectable state to be handed over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we can get private operators involved, it will be the lifeblood of the rail system in this country&mdash;particularly AN, which we are debating here today. We were worried about who would be interested in the passenger services. We were more confident of who would be interested in the freight services&mdash;and that is to come later. But, despite that, 56 serious expressions of interest came in. We have narrowed those down to 16 and a decision on that is imminent&mdash;within a matter of weeks or a short few months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the future operator or operators will be much more responsive to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5592"> customers and will be able to provide up&hyphen;market tourism. For example, the Indian Pacific that runs through my electorate between Parkes and Broken Hill can be promoted for the first time as a world&hyphen;class tourist experience, the same as is done with the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Orient Express</EMPHASIS> in Asia and Europe, with the Canadian Rocky Mountains train and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blue Train</EMPHASIS> in South Africa. It is done in other areas of the world and should have been done in Australia many years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If private operators come in, we will see a surge of confidence in rail. We are already seeing it to some extent in freight now. We have got SCT and TNT operating between Melbourne and Perth. We have got Patrick who have not long started up between Melbourne and Adelaide. Only the other day I had the great privilege and honour of opening facilities of the FCL organisation, who are going to operate freight services between Parkes and Perth. On that line between Sydney and Parkes and Broken Hill and Crystal Brook, north of Adelaide, through to Perth, the closest point to Sydney where you can double&hyphen;stack containers&mdash;because of tunnels and bridges, et cetera&mdash;is Parkes. FCL have come in there on the conjunction of the east&hyphen;west rail line and the north&hyphen;south road line&mdash;the Newell Highway between Brisbane and Melbourne. It is an ideal point to start this operation. They are going to double&hyphen;stack containers&mdash;containers up to 48 feet long. We saw the first loaded to go to Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That will be a service running five days a week over and back. You put a container on the rail in Parkes and 60 hours later it is being unloaded in Perth. I pay tribute to the managing director of FCL, Bill Gibbins, who started that company in 1974. He borrowed about $3,000 from the State Bank of Victoria and I think he was one of the few who paid his debt back! FCL has grown into one of the biggest container freight services today. It is a great tribute to the traditional history of some very colourful transport operators that we have had in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That east&hyphen;west rail line is underutilised by about fourfold. It is the shortest, quickest and flattest rail journey between Sydney and Perth and it should be used more. I am delighted to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> see that it is being used in this manner. The thing that tipped the success in favour of FCL using this operation was that they finally won the Email contract to shift whitegoods. They have taken whitegoods off roads for long distance and they are now putting them on rail, which is something I believe we all want to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that the Newell Highway, which cuts north&hyphen;south through Parkes, is 1,682 kilometres in length between Brisbane and Melbourne. In the future I think we will see a lot of containers coming down by road into Parkes to be loaded on rail to go west to Perth. There is tremendous potential there. We have only had 600&hyphen;metre length trains in New South Wales in the past. They are stepping up in length now. A 900&hyphen;metre train is equivalent to 45 semitrailers or 24 B&hyphen;doubles and 1,500&hyphen;metre freight trains are equivalent to 75 semitrailers or 40 B&hyphen;doubles. We can now get some of that freight off our roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said all that, there is a pressing need to get this legislation through. Everybody wants it&mdash;everybody except the federal Labor Party. They are so out of touch with the rest of Australia. Australian National wants it&mdash;the operator that we are talking about here today. The users of the service want it, which includes the passengers, of course. The workers in Australian National want it&mdash;they have even presented a petition to parliament, I believe. And the coalition government, of course, wants it. Everybody wants it&mdash;except the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a letter here from Mark Carter, the executive officer of Rail 2000. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We support the sale of AN. If we delay this process any further, what you are going to see is that there will be no rural rail services in South Australia, and the same is true for Tasmania.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our view is that the sale proceed as quickly as possible.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, all Australians are in favour&mdash;except for the Labor Party.

The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) has just spoken and I thank him for his contribution.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I just want to go through some of the contributions from the other side and I will talk about the shadow minister shortly. I want to speak about the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel). On what authority the member for Fraser is talking about matters in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5594"> the regions is absolutely beyond me, but I suppose we should not be surprised given that, after the Canberra by&hyphen;election, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said that this is a clear message from regional Australia. You might be interested to know that the Electoral Commission actually describes the electorate of Fraser as being inner metropolitan. These are the Labor Party regional members talking about it when they are coming from seats that are described as being inner metropolitan. That is utter hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought the other interesting comment from the member for Fraser concerned the need for a rail vision&mdash;for a rail policy. This government has been in power now for some 14 or 15 months. We, indeed, have a rail policy; it is in this legislation. I do not know where the member for Fraser was over the past 13 years of his government, but they had no policy. That is why we are in this diabolical mess that we are now in which is affecting a very special group of Australians&mdash;the workers involved in AN; the workers who were, effectively, over 13 years, tossed onto the scrap heap by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then heard from the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who is probably better known as the cabotage kid. How you can get that into a speech about rail is absolutely beyond me, but I suppose I should not be surprised because I am sure he goes to bed muttering `cabotage' before he goes off to sleep. He talked about the US rail system and what was being done, and how successful it was. The US rail system is now predominantly run by the private sector. They have turned around a moribund rail system and made it successful, and that is exactly what this legislation is designed to do&mdash;to turn around a moribund situation. I am glad that he raised it, but he should hang his head in shame for not getting his facts right about who was doing what and where. I suppose you could say that there are none so blind as those who will not see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to turn to the shadow minister, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). In the 7&half; years I have been here I have never heard, and I very
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> much doubt whether other members who have been here for longer would have heard, a speech about a matter of such importance in this country which lacked so much passion. The member for Melbourne simply did not have his heart in this debate. I rather suspect that that is because the troglodyte quads have got to him&mdash;Beazley, Evans, Crean and Ferguson; the ones who have destroyed the young braves&mdash;and he is very much in that category. He put his head up with something which he thought was appropriate for new Labor and they knocked him down. They knocked him down with great passion. Of course, when you have a Leader of the Opposition who is intent on muzzling young MPs and knocking on the head those who pretend to have a bit of vision, you can see why this flame has flickered and gone out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The alternative is that the member for Melbourne did not believe the things he put in his paper, `Populism and rationalism'. If he did not, he should say so; if he did, then the troglodyte quads should apologise to someone who is trying to do something constructive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most disappointing aspect of the speech from the member for Melbourne was his lack of vision about the rail sector and his blatant attempt to blame every single person involved in this except the ones who are truly guilty&mdash;the party that he represents. I will talk only about that today because that was all that the member for Melbourne wanted to do&mdash;apportion blame to everyone else. The classic was to attack the author of the report, Mr Brew himself. In my view, that was a disgraceful attack. It was a grubby attack on someone who did no more than tell the facts of life about what the former government had done in relation to AN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just go through the Brew report again, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I think the House should be aware of it. I know other members have made some reference to it. Seven thousand rail jobs were lost in 13 years. Fifty per cent of the South Australian rail network was closed and ripped up. There was a $1 billion dollar debt&mdash;a one thousand million dollar debt&mdash;with absolutely no way of servicing it. Passenger rail services to Mt Gambier, Burra, Peterborough, Port Augusta,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5595"> Whyalla and Broken Hill were all closed. In South Australia alone 16 lines&mdash;1,300 kilometres of track&mdash;were ripped up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brew report went on to talk about the level of liability and the subsidy by the Australian taxpayer which currently stands at about $30,000 per annum but which would increase to about $220,000 if nothing was done. Business levels were decreasing and there was no way known that AN could cover its costs; it was technically bankrupt. The report also revealed a very interesting fact: that it was the way that the Labor Party had set up NR that caused AN's problems. NR was given all the best assets and the revenue generating infrastructure; AN was left with the debt and no possible way of repaying it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Someone was quoted as saying that AN was doomed from the day NR began. Was that the minister for transport? Was it me? Was it John Brew? Was it one of the AN rail workers? Was it? Do you want to know who it was? It was, in fact, Senator Collins. Senator Collins is reported as saying in the Senate References Committee hearings in Adelaide and Port Augusta that AN was doomed the day NR began.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have announced a $2 billion reform program to fix the problem. That is just part of our rail policy. A part of any policy must be to fix the problems before you head into the future. Ah, the shadow minister has arrived.</PARA>

They have put themselves out on a limb from industry, from AN workers, from users, from the South Australian Farmers Federation and the list goes on&mdash;you name them, I have got pages of messages from them.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not for one minute think that the member for Melbourne is not concerned about families, but he needs to be acutely aware that, by being rolled on this issue by the troglodyte quads, he has left the very people that he should be supporting in an incredible lurch. It is those people&mdash;not the multimillion dollar industry people, not those with vested interests&mdash;the workers themselves, who have pleaded with him to do something about it and let the sale go on.

And where has the invisible man been? Nowhere. But he sits across here during question time smiling and with that stupid little giggle talking about what the government is doing in relation to Newcastle.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments relate to one particular issue, and that is the future track authority that is proposed by this government, which was also proposed by the previous government. The net effect of this legislation before the parliament today is to allow the government to constitute that track authority to make decisions with respect to its operations, its functions, its activities and how it will be financed without any further reference to the parliament. This, in effect, means that a major Commonwealth statutory authority will be established with a new set of functions without any reference to this parliament. The purpose of these amendments is to extract from the legislation the specific references in the legislation that would enable this to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going through the amendments item by item you will see that, in effect, what they do is take out any power with respect to the two ministers named in the legislation to take action either to amend legislation or repeal it insomuch as that may refer to the prospective track authority or any dealings whatsoever in the interstate mainline track assets of Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated earlier, the opposition believes it is outrageous that the government has come to the parliament with a piece of legislation on such a major issue that simply states that the two ministers concerned, the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance, shall, in effect, have complete power to make all decisions with respect to dealing with that organisation, including the power to declare acts of this parliament repealed or amended.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point that I think needs to be made, particularly to those who have been fairly free with their interjections, is that in Labor's last year in office  youth unemployment was a staggering 32.3 per cent. This government's priority is about to give young people the opportunity of obtaining a job, and we are making changes to the system that are designed to achieve just that. This will be a uniform set of arrangements for all young people. It involves the amalgamation of payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter that has been long called for by a large number of welfare organisations, and I welcome particularly the support of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, who today have said: `We have been asking for better support for this group of young people for many years and finally their needs are starting to be recognised.' They make the further point: `Homeless young people are often forced to drop out of school or training simply because financial pressures are too great. Sixteen&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who come to our services have to meet the same costs as other young people living independently and the extra $12 a week are much needed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That change, the amalgamation of payments, is something that has been long supported and sought. It was a matter that the former government decided not to address. I do not know the reasons for that. The change will mean that the majority of young people will be unaffected as a result of the change and 137,000 will be better off. The changes remove the disincentive to study which saw the dollars of the unemployed&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what was happening in your electorate. This change will ensure that those young people will be in a position to undertake studies. This is not about putting the unemployed down; it is about bringing students up. It is designed to encourage the maximum skills possible. The fact is that young people were three times more likely to be unemployed if they left school at the year 10 level than if they left at year 12. So this is about keeping them in education. It is about giving them vocational
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> skills as well as the opportunity to study for degrees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just tell you of the nature of the change: 41,000 students will benefit from the abolition of the $1,000 per annum Austudy minimum entitlement requirement; 16,600 students will benefit from the independence criteria, which are more lenient than those which currently apply under Austudy; 19,900 former students will gain from the abolition of the waiver period; around 15,000 unemployed and 19,500 students, most of them under 18, who are living away from home and/or are independent will benefit from receiving an increased rate of payment; and 9,300 continuing students aged 25 and over will benefit from the alignment of rates with the youth allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All youth allowance recipients will have access to the $500 loan advance currently available to the newstart allowance recipients. For the first time young people will be entitled to rent assistance. This will be up to $75 a fortnight.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is true. Around 70,000 students will benefit from the extension of rent assistance with an estimated average gain of $31 per fortnight. It is important for those in rural areas because very often they have to travel away from home to study. It will be very important in assisting them.

Customs now operate to the 200 nautical mile EEZ.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. As the Acting Prime Minister has already indicated, this government's policies in relation to apprenticeships and traineeships in relation to the Green Corps have been very pro young Australians. The introduction of the youth allowance is but another measure to encourage young Australians and to give them an incentive to go into education and to get the skills they will need throughout their lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to place this in another economic context. It is this: nothing could be more anti the young people of Australia than the policy of deficit and debt of the Labor Party. The policy of deficit and debt of the Labor Party was a selfish policy. What it essentially said is that the Labor Party would use funds it did not have today to try to buy votes and send the bill to the young Australians of tomorrow. It is the policy of this government to rescue the young Australians of tomorrow from that crushing burden of Labor Party debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In five years from 1990, the Labor Party ran up cumulative deficits of $58 billion for a cumulative loss of 50,000 jobs&mdash;a cumulative loss of 50,000 jobs over five years on nearly $60 billion of borrowed money. That borrowed money did not just go away. That borrowed money has to be serviced year in year out by the Australians of today and the Australians of tomorrow who will be paying taxes to fund what Mr Beazley, the finance minister who presided over that economic melee, did. As a result of his failure as a finance minister, generations of young Australians are going to be servicing the debts that the Keating Labor Party and the now Labor opposition have visited on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the policy of this government, first of all, to get the government living within its means and in the course of the next financial year not to borrow but to repay Commonwealth debt. For the first time in a decade the burden on future generations will be lessened in the forthcoming financial year, as opposed to the Labor Party policy. These are the government's efforts: firstly, to balance the Australian accounts; secondly, to reduce
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5606"> interest rates; thirdly, to reduce government debt; and, fourthly, to give the young people in future Australia a go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake: the Labor policy of deficit, debt and high interest rates was an anti-youth policy. It was condemning future generations to a crushing burden of debt and taxation from which they would not have escaped had it not been this government's determination to turn it around. I suppose having created the problem the Labor opposition then sat around and took every step they could to try to prevent the solution to the problem. They came in here. They voted against measure after measure. They were determined to inflict a continuing deficit and debt misery on future Australians. The best that can be said is that they were unsuccessful in their efforts. The Australian economy is back on track. The fiscal accounts will be balanced. Debt will be repaid and young people will be the great beneficiaries of that economic program.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Herbert, who has a real interest in this matter, for his question. He is a constant battler in his quest for a better performance for Australia's meat industry and its exports. I am very pleased to be able to announce that after detailed negotiations with their Chinese counterparts the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service officers in this country have successfully concluded a very important agreement on health conditions for the export of slaughter cattle to China. It is the beginnings of what I think will develop
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5607"> into a potentially very, very significant export trade. It effectively opens the door for large numbers of our cattle to enter the Chinese market. It should result in a major boost to trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that the Chinese plan is to import 60,000 head each year for the first three years of the agreement, after which an expansion to 100,000 head per year is likely. This represents a deal worth potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. Hard&hyphen;pressed beef producers from the southern areas of Australia will particularly benefit, but right across the nation there will be increased support for prices in a sector that at the moment is experiencing real difficulties. As trade builds, it will reinforce Chinese confidence in Australia's health status, potentially open direct opportunities for live cattle exports to other geographical areas as well and is, in general terms, very good news for rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night, we signed a memorandum of understanding with China over anthrax designed to avoid disruption to trade in the event of disease outbreaks here. This is very important indeed. People have to have security in our capacity to handle these things. Both agreements demonstrate the government's commitment to opening Asian markets to Australian agricultural products and keeping them open, having opened them in the first place under the Prime Minister's supermarket to Asia plan and reinforced, if I may say so, very ably and in a very committed way not only by the Minister for Trade but also by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point should also be made that these exports are absolutely essential for jobs, especially where we really need jobs and that is out in the regions where unemployment has been very high. The point can also be usefully made that we could, with perhaps just one out of three or four of our farmers, produce enough food or fibre for our domestic markets. All the other farm sectors and industries and the employment in those industries that support the farm sector depend upon export markets for their livelihoods, for their jobs. So the opportunities of the sort that I have just outlined give us a real chance not only to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I owe him a lot. He put me off left&hyphen;wing politics for life. The subject was the morality of power. The member for Bradfield asked me about the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5608"> income tax system. It is true that the Australian taxation system does not equitably share the burden between the various bases that are used to collect tax in Australia. In Australia, by international standards, the indirect tax base is a narrow base and is a declining base. Conversely, the income tax base has borne more than its fair share in relation to the raising of revenue in Australia. Australia's top marginal tax rate of 47 per cent cuts in at about 1&half; times average earnings. The second top marginal tax rate of 43 per cent is also very high and cuts in at a little over average earnings itself. They are the marginal tax rates&mdash;notwithstanding the relief given by the coalition to families under the family tax initiative, which of course was vigorously opposed by the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And in particular by the member for Werriwa, who interjects now. He was opposed to the family tax initiative and reducing the tax burden for families. That means that, whilst Australia's top marginal tax rates are quite high by international standards, they cut in at very low multiples of average earnings. Part of the reason is that our indirect tax base is a declining tax base. The Australian indirect tax base is principally focused on goods. In modern economies it is the services sector of those economies that is growing the fastest and taking an increasing share of gross domestic product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will often hear manufacturers in this country complain that the indirect tax system features so heavily on goods. Because it features so heavily on goods, the indirect tax system is a special disadvantage for manufacturing industry. Obviously those who have an interest in manufacturing industry would support a broadening of the indirect tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One cannot overlook the difficulties of the income tax system because of the way in which it impacts the incentives that there are to try to avoid the application of the income tax system and the level of advising and costs that go into avoiding the operation of the income tax system in Australia. It is important for any government to constantly attend as
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> well to closing down loopholes in the income tax system and broaden the base of the income tax system in Australia. This government has a very proud record of achievement in relation to this. It was this government that closed down the R&amp;D syndicates which had become an absolute haemorrhage in relation to the income tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, you will hear the Leader of the Opposition interjecting because the Leader of the Opposition wanted to preserve R&amp;D syndicates&mdash;a CJO that thought that, if they could offer a way of avoiding income tax that was being closed down by this government, they would go to those people who were using them and, in an effort to try to buy cheap votes, oppose the closing down of R&amp;D syndicates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well may he turn his back at this point. It is a matter of shame for the Australian Labor Party which was not prepared to support measures to widen the income tax base. Nor could we forget it was the Australian Labor Party that was opposed to the superannuation surcharge. There was great concern in the Australian Labor Party to income earners earning over $85,000 whose tax concession had changed from 33 per cent under the ALP policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bradfield asked me about those sections of the community carrying the heaviest taxation burden. One of the reasons why the PAYE taxpayer carries such a heavy burden of income tax has been the number of avenues that have been open for high income earners to avoid their fair share. That is one of the reasons why the PAYE taxpayer carries such a heavy burden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What were the chief mechanisms for high income earners to avoid their fair share of income taxation? R&amp;D syndicates were a ripper. They made paying income tax quite voluntary. The superannuation surcharge for somebody over $85,000 gave you a 33 per cent tax concession if your salary was sacrificed&mdash;and the Labor Party opposed reducing the tax concessionality; the Labor Party opposed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you had over $135,000 of annual income, infrastructure borrowings made it voluntary to pay tax, if you got into the right scheme.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Who introduced them? The infrastructure borrowings were introduced by the Australian Labor Party, now crying crocodile tears as a result of this government's efforts to clean up the income tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has taken a very robust view to making sure that we protect the PAYE taxpayers. And again, with CJO, cheap jack opportunism, the Australian Labor Party opposed those measures. The friends of the tax schemes, the Australian Labor Party, opposed those measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, Mr Speaker, if you are looking at improving the Australian taxation system, of course it is important to widen the indirect tax base. But it is also important to make sure that the income tax base is wide and is not easily avoidable. That is very much a part of this government's approach to taxation. The only regret we have is that, when we do do it, we cannot rely on the Australian Labor Party for any help whatsoever.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have placed a very heavy emphasis on a strong relationship between Australia and Indonesia. The strength of that relationship reflects not only the geopolitical importance of Indonesia to Australia but also the geopolitical importance of Australia to Indonesia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of the meeting in Bali I had the opportunity to discuss at some length the bilateral relationship between Australia and Indonesia with the Coordinating Minister for Production and Distribution, Mr Hartarto.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Speaker's ruling be dissented from.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no more important function performed by this chamber than that it holds ministers accountable. That is absolutely the central feature of this question time process. The question that was just asked of this minister, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), goes to business relationships that he conducts at the point of time when he happens to be a minister. That is what the question was about. It dealt with the minister's position as far as his business involvements were concerned in relation to those three shopping centres which he has manifestly&mdash;and I would say, too, in breach of the standing orders and the requirements of this place&mdash;refused to place or failed to place in his register of interests. And that is another matter that this House will have to deal with at some point in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps it would have been easier to deal with now in regard to this dissent to your ruling had there been an honest return from this minister in the statement of his interests in this place. Had there been an honest return
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5612"> from this minister, there could have been no question that it was front and centre within the rights of members of this House to ask the minister questions about his situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The code of conduct, which every minister signs up to in this place and which is honoured more in the breach these days than in the observance&mdash;but which, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) admitted, is a code of conduct which effectively replicated that which was in place while we were in office and prior to our appointment to government&mdash;requires, among other things, that a minister shall not conduct the affairs of his businesses when he holds a ministerial position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just a question of appearance but also a question of absolute propriety. But appearance is important in that regard as well. When you go from simply stating whether or not those interests exist to active promotion of business concerns as far as a minister's portfolio is concerned, you are getting right at the heart of whether or not disinterested government is running this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can it possibly not be relevant for the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, who is conducting an inquiry into the situation of people with franchises, the situation of people in tenancies and the possibilities of oppressive conduct? He has answered an array of questions in this House; he has referred those matters to a parliamentary committee; he has had a report on those matters and is handling those matters for the government. And, I might say, he responded earlier on to a question about conduct in relation to franchisees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was still responsible for the development of government policy in that matter even though, while he is developing the policy on the question of oppressive conduct in relation to tenants, evidently the Prime Minister has removed that particular authority from him and he now finds himself in a situation where he has a question directed to the heart of his propriety on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Has he had contact with the Western Australian government&mdash;directly or indirectly, verbally or in writing, by lobbying, bringing pressure to bear or whatever&mdash;on behalf of his business interests? Has he had any discussions
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with a director of the Coles Myer board in relation to any of the tenancies in his particular holdings? And you rule that matter out of order. Frankly, Mr Speaker, there is no logic in that ruling. None. If there is logic in that ruling, then this House cannot query ministers as to the propriety of their conduct on anything at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just go through the code of conduct of ministerial responsibility.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers (this and subsequent references to ministers should be read as including parliamentary secretaries) must not engage in any professional practice or in the daily work of any business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I stress that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . or in the daily work of any business.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The central guideline is that they must not engage in any professional practice or in the daily work of any business.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If the minister has had discussions in relation to tenancies in his shopping centres, if he has approached directors who have in their control some capacity to determine whether or not somebody will take up a tenancy, if he has approached a state government with regard to any planning authorities that are associated with his business activities, if he is handling on a routine basis employment issues that pass across his desk&mdash;and I remind you, Mr Speaker, that earlier a question was asked on that in which he openly said he is handling those employment considerations&mdash;there can be simply no question at all that what the minister is doing is engaging in the daily work of his business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What else is the daily work of a business of a person who owns shopping centres other
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> than the question of who tenants the place, the terms and conditions under which those tenants go in, the terms and conditions laid down for the expansion or development of those places, the terms and conditions associated with the employees? What is daily work if that is not daily work associated with a business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do standards of propriety mean in this place if there is no capacity to identify a relationship between decisions being taken by a minister and the business practices of that minister? That daily activity that I referred to would preclude the minister from involvement, no matter what his portfolio was. That is a prohibition not simply against a minister's role as a minister and what his business interests might be. If that were going on it would not be required of us as an opposition to establish a direct relationship between the two. It would not be required of us to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case of course we can, because the ministerial portfolio covers the sorts of business arrangements in which he is directly engaged in his daily work. Were he to be the Treasurer, the Attorney&hyphen;General or the Minister for Defence, it would still be possible for us to question him in this regard because this prohibition does not simply go to direct relationships to the minister's duties; it goes to the activities of a minister generally. But in this instance it does go, so it is doubly culpable of the minister that he should confront this issue and that he should be capable of being questioned about it. If you rule that out in this place, Mr Speaker, then there is a deal of trouble for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister frequently defends his position now in words that I remember Charlie Court once saying that he did not want a minister to have the seat out of his pants. The Prime Minister says further that it is a good thing for him to have ministers in this place who have had business interests and the experience. I would not dispute that; I do not think it is a bad thing at all that members of this House should have had business experience. But there is a point in time when choices have to be made; when you become a minister, choices have to be made. You  either
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5614"> make a decision that you are going to be able to uphold your ministerial duties to the highest standards that are imposed upon you or you are going to do something else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are issues that ministers have to confront continually. Sometimes the appropriate response of a minister is to absent himself from cabinet if there is a clash, and a clash that is not likely to be regular. Sometimes there is a necessity to hand the responsibility for a particular portfolio's conduct over to another minister on a narrow area of that minister's position. But sometimes it is necessary for a minister to make a choice and to decide that he will either divest himself or put himself at demonstrable arm's length from a particular activity if he is going to be able to handle his affairs appropriately. One thing a minister cannot do under any circumstances at all&mdash;at least on a proper reading of these particular circumstances; and this is not a question of standing aside from a particular decision every now and then&mdash;is to engage in any professional practice or in the daily work of any business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know, Mr Speaker, that you would have trouble discerning what the government's intentions are in regard to the operation of a code of conduct. This would be, to some extent, mitigating what we believe to be an incorrect ruling, because this government has absolutely no standards when it comes to enforcing its standards. This government has run away from it repeatedly when questioned in this place, and it has to be said that these ministerial standards remain under review 15 months after this government has been appointed. We still do not have them finalised. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister made clear that, while they were going down the road of revising those ministerial standards, these ministerial standards would continue to apply. And so they should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recollect&mdash;and I have actually had the numbers asked of him&mdash;that when the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was on the other side of the chamber and in this place he was subject to 14 questions in relation to his piggery from Hewson, McLachlan and all at that time&mdash;and not one of them was ruled out. The former Prime Minister's defence consis
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tently, in so far as that piggery was concerned, was that he had absolutely no contact with the day to day conduct of that business. Question after question was trying to establish whether or not he had. Questions were asked as to whether or not he had intervened with the New South Wales government in the environmental processes that had been put in place, questions were asked as to whether or not he had intervened with consumer affairs in relation to New South Wales on some other aspects of it and questions were asked as to whether or not he had tried to influence local authorities in relation to the conduct of his piggery. You will recollect those, Mr Speaker, because you were in the chamber when those questions were asked&mdash;all of them asked directly of the Prime Minister at that time. There were 14 questions in all and not one was ruled out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been asked of the minister directly by the member for Cunningham is simply this: Minister, have you had contact with a director of Coles Myer; have you had contact with any person in the Western Australian government related to the conduct of your businesses in Bunbury? It is a simple question that goes to the very heart of his personal accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has to be said that, if you had sat down and worked your way through the particular propositions that are related to his declaration, you could be excused for thinking that maybe this was not entirely relevant. But by now I think it should be entirely obvious to you that one of the most misleading documents currently circulating in the chamber is the register of members' interests in so far as it affects the conduct of this particular minister. We have a petrol station and three shopping centres with 80 tenants in those shopping centres described as `Bunbury&mdash;various lots.' Perhaps it would have been a little more accurate if it had been `Bunbury, various, lots.' That might have been a more accurate description, but it would still oblige the minister to put those positions down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The common way in which this has been handled in the past has been for not the value of any particular shareholding to be outlined, not the value of any particular property
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5615"> obtained or owned to be outlined, nor necessarily its address, but an accurate description of what is owned. That is what has generally been required, and members conform. They usually say that they have a holiday home or a block of flats or whatever it is. They do not put down `Bunbury&mdash;various lots' for three shopping centres. An accurate rendition of this would have been `three shopping centres and one petrol station'. That probably would have been an accurate rendition, in so far as we know it thus far, of the member's interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that has not appeared here. The fact that it has not appeared here and therefore alerted you&mdash;as a person who is a diligent student, as the Speaker must be&mdash;of these particular returns on people's interests, you by now will have, nevertheless, had it firmly revealed to you by us that there are inadequacies here and there is a potential area of a conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was enough for the Prime Minister, at the beginning of this week, to take responsibility off him. The Prime Minister certainly now thinks this is relevant. That is why he took responsibility for one area of presentation to cabinet off the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs and handed it to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). Unfortunately, not much of it, just that part that deals with the cabinet submission process in cabinet itself. The development of those codes of conduct, however, remain within his hands, and the presentation to government was within his hands up until the beginning of this week, so anything that is historical in that regard is relevant as far as accountability is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new front has opened up here now with his responsibilities in relation to franchising arrangements and the potentiality of particular franchisees&mdash;both in his petrol station and, of course, in his shopping centres&mdash;to produce for him a conflict of interest in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I conclude this dissent motion&mdash;which I moved with very great reluctance and considerable surprise&mdash;by saying that you as Speaker must uphold the capacity of this House to query the government and the government's ministers' handling of all
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aspects of their portfolios. You must, above all, permit this House to be able to query a minister about a clash between personal private interests and ministerial duties. This is the only place in which these queries can be raised on behalf of the Australian people. This is the only place where confidence can be established for the Australian people that they are impartially governed. If the opposition is denied it in this place, it will be a precedent. No opposition has been denied it before&mdash;certainly not by us in 13 years in government&mdash;and you should act now to reverse your decision.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. Mr Speaker, I have to admit that when this question was actually put to you today I was somewhat staggered when you ruled it out of order. Perhaps I along with the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and your good self&mdash;not to forget, of course, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith)&mdash;would probably be in a better position to know about these sorts of issues because, quite frankly, the question that was put here and the reason we have dissented from your ruling did nothing more than endeavour to elicit questions and answers from the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) about issues which have been the subject of some discussion and concern in this place for a period of time now. It struck me as somewhat odd that&mdash;and in past history in this parliament your predecessors have allowed questions on a variety of issues which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has already referred to&mdash;a question of this nature should be ruled out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, firstly, at different times during the last parliament something like 14 questions were allowed to the then Prime Minister about his private interests in a piggery. It could well have been suggested then that it had nothing to do with his ministerial responsibilities and ruled out. But the learned Speaker of the time allowed it to pass. I am sure those that are now in government thought it was a great idea at the time. Secondly, we had the example of the honourable member for Fremantle
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5616"> (Dr Lawrence), who was under a degree of questioning in the last parliament, and the same thing applied when questions were put to her about the Labor Party that had nothing to do with her ministerial responsibilities and again were allowed to pass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Mr Speaker, I have to say we find it rather strange that this ruling has been handed down. We do so also for a number of other reasons. The first is that it has been clearly established in this place that the minister for small business has a conflict of interest when it comes to his ownership of property and his responsibility to develop small business policy on behalf of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have ascertained that that is the case from no other source than the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) removing from the minister's responsibility the response to the retail tenancy issues contained in the fair trading report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and giving that responsibility to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). We still have not worked out when it happened, because in question time on Monday the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs and the Prime Minister were still saying that the minister for small business had that responsibility. By 3.30 that was still the go. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> that night the minister for small business owned up and said, `Oh, that has now gone to John Moore, the minister for industry. They've taken it off me because there is a conflict of interest.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly&mdash;and this is another reason we have taken exception to your ruling on the question that was put&mdash;another area of conflict of interest has been exposed in relation to this minister, and that is the question of franchises. Looking again at the recommendations of the fair trading inquiry report, one can see that recommendation 3.1, which deals particularly with franchising, goes directly to the minister's personal interest because in his own shopping centres there are franchisees who occupy positions: Cash Converters, Chicken Treat and Farmer Jack's&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, on a further point of order: I am seeking advice because it will influence how I vote.

They asked if `any time'. Would that influence your judgment?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The simple answer is yes, but there is no point of order. I call the honourable member for Cunningham and encourage him to stay within the confines of the dissenting motion.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have dissented from your ruling in respect of that question because you have allowed other questions that go to eliciting information, or at least attempting to elicit information, from this minister about his dealings. The simple fact is that when questions were put to him today about franchising and whether there were any existing franchisees in his own stores and shopping centres he said, `I'm complying with the guidelines.' We are dissenting from your view that further questions about franchising, about his private dealings in shopping centres and about whether he has been talking with representatives of the Coles Myer board or planning ministers in Western Australia to get some advantage for his own business interests in Western Australia are out of order and whether that means you have taken the right option of ruling questions of that nature out of order. We would simply argue that that is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that needs to be made again is this: if this minister does not have any conflicts of interest and if you, therefore, subsequently have to rule further questions to him about his business dealings out of order, why then did the Prime Minister remove him from responsibility for retail tenancy issues? As a logical extension to my question as to wheth
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5617"> er or not you will continue to permit questions to this minister on other issues, the fact that he does have this interest in franchising again raises the question about who on behalf of the government will now respond to the recommendations of the fair trading inquiry report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If in fact this minister is removed, the question is: who do we continue to ask questions of in this place, given the Prime Minister is not here to give us some satisfactory answers? It also goes to the fact of whether you would rule these sorts of questions out of order if we addressed them to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, as the portfolio minister who has now been given some responsibility, the absent Prime Minister or the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), because I am sure he would have an interest in this as well. The simple fact is that, if there were no problems about this minister, his pecuniary interest declarations and the Prime Minister's code of ministerial conduct, we would not have asked these questions and we would not, therefore, be in the position where you have ruled one question asked by this side of the parliament out of order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition simply went to some very fundamental and basic points in support of why you should reverse your ruling on this matter. He went to the minister's real estate entry in the register of members' interests which noted, as we have all seen before, `Bunbury&mdash;various lots.' If this minister is to be believed, if this minister is to be taken seriously in this place and by retail tenants and retailers in Australia and their associations as being dispassionate, as being an advocate on their behalf, why did he not list in here that he is a landlord? Why is it that, three days after this report was tabled, he went out and said that, in terms of franchising, he does not agree with any of those recommendations and always wanted voluntary codes? Why is it that in last year's budget this minister cut the funding for the Franchising Code Council?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could ask a few questions like that, just as retailers have been doing. Many of the retailers in his own shopping centres have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been asking questions. We are trying to ask questions here and you are knocking them out. One of his retailers&mdash;I had better not identify her because he is her landlord&mdash;is reported as saying in the media, `He shouldn't be the federal minister for small business and such a major landlord. We have a number of franchises in our centre'&mdash;I have named those&mdash;`and I don't know how Geoff can be making decisions about what happens to franchisers either.' Neither do we. That is why we are putting questions that go to this minister's direct responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter links his hands&hyphen;on daily work and his hands&hyphen;on approach to his businesses to his still being a minister of the Crown. The Prime Minister brought down his ministerial guidelines, but quite frankly I think the Prime Minister set the high jump bar so low that they are not worth worrying about. These ministers walk through them as if they do not exist.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely, I intend to do just that. As I said to you earlier, Mr Speaker, we have a right and a duty in this place to put questions to ministers about their responsibilities. We have a right and a duty on behalf of constituents around this country to say to ministers: `Do you have conflicts of interest? If you do, what does that mean in terms of the Prime Minister's guidelines for ministers?' It means nothing. And if we cannot put questions in this place for fear that they are
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5618"> going to be ruled out of order by you, Mr Speaker, then we are indeed in a great deal of trouble.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all seen the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today, which concludes that this minister should go because there is  a conflict of interest. We have said that; we have established that. Retailers around this country are saying just that. They want us, on their behalf, to put questions to this minister about his dealings on a daily basis. Does he see the tax forms come into his companies; do those people that are managers of his shopping centres? Does that impact on our ability to ask him questions about whether that conflicts with the Prime Minister's code of conduct? And it does. The manager of one of his shopping centres, Colin, is reported as having said, `Well, I have to go and have a chat to Geoff occasionally to find out what we should do.' Is that part of the Prime Minister's guidelines? Is looking after shopping centres being divorced from day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day involvement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the Western Australian Retailers Association? They want questions asked, because they said in a letter to the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that you have already demonstrated your leadership in issues of conflict of interest, integrity and probity, in particular that of the banking vested interests, we see no reason why Minister Prosser should not be treated similarly to his colleague Mr Short.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is dead right. Mr Short is going to Europe to a banking job. Maybe the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs has to go back to Bunbury to engage in a full hands&hyphen;on approach in his own business interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We wish to put questions in this place about retail tenancy issues, about franchising, about the minister's hands&hyphen;on, day-to&hyphen;day dealings with his business interests and questions about whether or not there has been in some way an approach by this minister&mdash;now or at some stage when he has had responsibility for small business&mdash;about each and every one of his shopping centre developments, whether in the past or proposed. We would like to be able to do that without fear,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sir, of your saying to this side of the place that they are out of order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would ask you to go back and look at the Barlin book and some past history there, to get the historic <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> and look at what was allowed by your predecessors in terms of prime ministers and their activities.

We would say to you, sir, that it is incumbent upon you, having listened to the argument of the Leader of the Opposition and me, to reverse your ruling, allow that question to stand, allow the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs to come to the dispatch box and to tell us once again how he has not breached the Prime Minister's guidelines, how he should remain in control of responding to the fair trading inquiry report and why the retailers of Australia should have every confidence in him as a landlord that he will do the right thing by them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a question from one of the independent members. That question was put to him and he answered it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very technical issue. The question is whether or not the question that was asked was within the requirements of the standing orders. Before I answer that in detail, the simple facts are these. From a practical point of view, you ruled the question out of order. The opportunity to ask a question would then have gone to the government. Then it would have been the opposition's turn and they then could have asked a question which was in order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This claim that this ruling of yours has prevented them asking questions of the minister is clearly false. First, he has been asked three questions, which he answered. Furthermore, he would have been answering further questions on this very issue if only those on the other side, Mr Speaker, with all the experience of sitting in your seat and running tactics on the other side, had only been smart enough to understand what the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) pointed out to them in his engaging question to you. The point he made to you was: if the question had been properly drafted, would you have allowed it to have been asked? And the obvious answer is yes.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I had an interjection before which said, `Has anybody made such a ruling before?' For heaven's sake, read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> . It is there is black and white. You had no nexus; it was nothing to do with his ministerial responsibilities, and the question was clearly to financial personal interests of the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go on. This is an interesting little point that comes up in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As mentioned in the cases above, it is not in order for the personal conduct or private affairs of a Minister to be criticised by way of a question. A charge of a personal nature can only be raised by way of a direct and substantive motion. This fundamental parliamentary rule was re&hyphen;iterated by Speaker Snedden . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It then goes on to give the quote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another clue in this about the tactics. We had a number of questions on this issue yesterday. We sit here on the front bench and we get notes from our colleagues saying, `What is going to happen next? Are they going to do this or are they going to do that?' It was clear at the end of question time yesterday that they did not have enough for a censure motion. So we got no censure motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for what we have got today, in the tactics meeting they said, `Admission, admission.' There was nothing to run for a censure motion. Today, they pick up the papers, they see the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> editorial and they say, `Whoopee, we'll give it another run.' Do they run a censure motion? No. I would say that, in their tactics meeting this morning, the view would have been that it was quite clear that they did not have enough to run on a censure. The opportunity was provided today and an excuse was used. You did not have anything for a censure motion, so what do you do?
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5621"> You run an attack on the Speaker on the basis of a ruling that is as clear a ruling within the standing orders as I have ever seen in the whole time that I have been in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that there is no substantive motion. The fact of the matter is that, if you had not been so impatient, you would have been able to ask that question if you had properly worded it. That is the position. What an embarrassment the member for Kalgoorlie has been to you over the years, but what an acute embarrassment he was today when he asked the Speaker a question, basically on a point of order, which said, `If the question had been properly drafted, Mr Speaker, would you have allowed the question to have been asked and therefore required it to be answered?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did you say, Mr Speaker? Not that I am in any way attempting to involve you in this debate, Mr Speaker; it would be improper to do so. But, Mr Speaker, knowing you well, in your response the sense of accommodation you are prepared to afford the member for Kalgoorlie makes it quite clear that you actually do know what the standing orders mean when it comes to questions of this sort. Mr Speaker, you had no hesitation in ruling the question out of order. You had been considering the issues because the right honourable member for New England had put the issue to you quite squarely in the previous question. You clearly had it in your mind that this was an issue that you might have to address during question time today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought, with respect, Mr Speaker, without canvassing your views, that it was an option for you, in response to the member for New England, to in fact say, `Part of the question was in order and part of it was out of order.' But, Mr Speaker, you in your wisdom said, `No, the question was fair enough.' We accepted that ruling. Mr Speaker, in the hurly&hyphen;burly of the House, you have a discretion in the handling of these matters. You exercised that discretion in what you believed was a manner fair and consistent with the standing orders and reasonable in all the circumstances for the House to have these matters properly before it. So on that matter, Mr Speaker, we
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accepted your ruling. I was not up on my feet saying, `The second part is out of order. You want to support the member for New England.' There was none of that nonsense. Why wasn't I on my feet? Because the minister was more than happy to answer the question. He has got nothing to hide. He has complied with the ministerial requirements. He has complied with the requirements of disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a lot of talk about this disclosure of the ministers which says apparently&mdash;I have not even read the thing&mdash;`Bunbury various lots'. That is in the minister's own personal name. The other allegation is that he did not list certain properties, but those properties were held by the company and there is no requirement for him to go into the assets of the company of which he is a proprietor. If there was, we would have had the piggery! Every last little piglet would have been on the disclosure form! Was that the requirement then? No, it was not. So old CJO is putting up a new form of pecuniary interest declaration which, of course, he wants now but never wanted when the piglets were in charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Mr Speaker, we reject this on a very substantial basis, that is, this is a motion to dissent from your ruling. Mr Speaker, we do not like all of your rulings; we do not like them all and we would be dishonest if we said anything otherwise. But, Mr Speaker, if I could not say that, you would not be an independent Speaker. Mr Speaker, the fact of the matter is you exercise your discretion; you do so in conformity with the standing orders and on an independent basis. You have done so today. As I have shown as a matter of logic, as a matter of precedent, as a matter of common sense and as a matter of consistency, in every possible way the ruling that you gave, Mr Speaker, was entirely a correct order. On that basis, we have no hesitation in rejecting this motion of dissent. And we reject this opposition that has used this motion as a means to attack an excellent minister, a person who has done a first&hyphen;class job, and that is the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the member for Kalgoorlie asked me a series of questions concerning the recent arrival in the Torres Strait of a vessel with 139 people aboard. I undertook to provide further information when I was in a position to do so. I can now advise the honourable member that the group has told my department that they are from China's Fujian Province and that the steel&hyphen;hulled boat left China on 18 May this year. Departmental records indicate that this is indeed the largest single group of unauthorised arrivals to reach Australia for at least the last 10 years or so. The second largest arrival was a group of 118 Sino&hyphen;Vietnamese from China who arrived in Darwin in November 1994. All of the 139 people have now been flown to the Port Hedland detention centre where the facilities enable that group to be properly dealt with. That transport cost $337, and I do acknowledge that that is very significant amount of money.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some good things in this youth allowance change that the government announced yesterday. I think it is important to recognise the positive things that are in this youth allowance package. Ross Gittins commented in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  today that `Labor has reverted to default setting for oppositions, merely  opposing anything the government does.' That in fact is not the case. We do welcome some things in this package that was announced by the government yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, there are increased rates of payment for some people such as 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds living away from home, so long as they live away from home for work or study purposes, and for singles with children. We do welcome the increased flexibility, allowing people to combine part-time study and part-time work or looking for work. We also think that it is a very good thing to extend rent assistance to Austudy recipients. But, of course, as with everything this government does, that has a real sting in the tail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us remember what happened in last year's budget&mdash;something that is going to come into place on 1 July. Last year this government decided to cut rent assistance for people who share private rental accommodation. We know that most students do share their accommodation to cut down on costs. So they are going to face an increase in their rents as a result of this government's miserly approach to rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement with the government stops there. There are some very serious problems with what was announced by this government yesterday on the youth allowance. Let us first of all look at those young people aged 16 and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 17 and their families. It is not just the 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds that are going to be the big losers from this package but also their families. For those 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who have not finished school and who are not in full&hyphen;time education elsewhere, we understand that about 30,000 young people in this category will no longer get any assistance. These young people come from families who are, by definition, not wealthy, because there is already a means test on the youth allowance for these young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families with incomes as low as $25,000 will be facing a reduction in their budgets of $145 a fortnight&mdash;that is, $145 a fortnight&mdash;because their young 16&hyphen; or 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old cannot go to school, for whatever reason, and cannot find a job. That is a lot of money for low and middle income families that do not have that sort of money, $145 a fortnight, lying around to give to their young people to pay for food, to pay for travel and to pay for all the things that young people need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do agree that it is very important to encourage as many young people as possible to stay at school. Of course we want as many Australians as possible to finish year 12 or to go on to further education. We know that, if they do, their job prospects are much better. But we do think that these young adults should be encouraged to stay at school. They should not have the big stick taken to them, which is the approach of this government. They should be encouraged, not forced against their will because they have no other option. Can you imagine what it will be like for those young people at school who do not want to be there? They will not succeed at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the government, we recognise that staying at school and finishing year 12, or doing some other form of post&hyphen;school education or training, is not an option for every 16&hyphen; or 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old. I am sure that everybody in this House knows a 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old who just is not going to finish year 12. We will never have 100 per cent of our young people finishing year 12, no matter how nasty this government gets. We know that the best option for those people is, in fact, to get out in the work
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5626"> force and get a job as soon as possible, because that is what they want to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we will no longer know about those individuals, of course, is what happens to them, because they will not be counted as unemployed any more. As far as this government is concerned, they are just invisible, they do not exist. The government is not going to care about them; they are just going to be written off. That is the attitude of this government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Swept under the carpet.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PG6">Ms MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just swept under the carpet, as the honourable member for Banks says. These young Australians will have no choices, as a result of this government's changes. Looking for a job will not be an option for them unless, of course, their parents are able to afford to support their job search. Of course, those individuals in families that have the money to help them find a job will have a better chance. Families that can pay for their housing, their food and clothing, the phone bill and the bus fares will be okay. But for the families with no money, those unable to afford these things, there will be no help from this government in finding jobs for those young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The life chances of those children belonging to those families will be much diminished. As we discovered in question time from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), this government will not give them any assistance whatsoever with labour market programs, because these young people are to be written out of the system. They are no longer considered to be unemployed, so they cannot get any help from a labour market program, and neither can they get any assistance from the pathetic work for the dole program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not be taken in by the government's other response on 16&hyphen; and 17-year-olds. What the government is saying is that there will be 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships. Let us have a look at the truth. In fact, what we expect to happen is that there will be only a marginal increase in the number of apprenticeships and traineeships this year&mdash;maybe 3,000 places, at most. Under this government, growth in government apprenticeships has
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> actually declined; it has been cut by two-thirds. That is not what you hear from the honourable minister opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the $4 billion about which we have heard so much, the $4 billion that the government is going to put into technical and further education, what is the truth about that? That, of course, is the money that was already allocated&mdash;allocated by Labor for technical and further education.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PG6">Ms MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right&mdash;and then they cut it in this most recent budget by $72 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do the states think about this? State ministers have said to Minister Kemp that this is a `betrayal of trust over plans to expand the number of tertiary places'&mdash;a betrayal of trust. The states do not trust him, and you can be sure that the unemployed people will not trust him. The reason for the states not trusting him is that they know the $4 billion is not one cent extra; they know that it is $72 million less than they otherwise would have got.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they also know&mdash;and the minister knows this because he has put it on the public record&mdash;is that 60,000 people missed out on going to TAFE last year&mdash;60,000 people missed out on going. Yet, all these young people who are currently on the dole are being expected to find a place in TAFE. How on earth are they going to find a place in TAFE, when they have 60,000 others in front of them and absolutely no support from this government?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PG6">Ms MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When you came in, it was less&mdash;and now it is more. What will happen is that these young people will be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5627"> subject to a parental income test. Let us have a look at a few examples. One example is a female single parent with a 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;old adult and no other children. The mother is earning $28,000 as a clerk. What that family will lose per fortnight is $50. I will give another example. The father is a tradesperson earning $36,000 a year and the mother stays at home. This family will lose $121 per fortnight. I will give another example. The father is a tradesperson earning $36,000 per year and the mother works part-time as a salesperson earning nearly $10,000 per year. This family will lose $210 per fortnight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not wealthy families. These are low to middle income families who are having a hard time under this government. At every turn they face increases in their costs. What they are now being told is that, if they have a young adult living at home trying to find a job, they will have money taken out of their family budgets. These families will now have to pay for everything for their young people. The self&hyphen;respect of these young people will be taken away as they will have to front up to mum and dad and say, `I need pocket money. I am 19 or 20 years old and I need pocket money to pay to go on the bus or to go to the pictures or to try to find a job.' Let us remember that we have 27.5 per cent unemployment in the 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;old category.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="PRICE" NAMEID="QI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr Price</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So much for family values.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PG6">Ms MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly right. They do not care about families, and they certainly do not care about the young unemployed. This was going to be the big issue before the election that this government was going to address. What was the unemployment rate for this group before this government came to power? It was slightly less, at 27.4 per cent. The minister might like to address the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What these cuts to the youth allowance will mean to these young adults is basically that their lives and their family's lives will be that much worse. It is bad luck that you cannot get a job. It is bad luck that this government has done nothing to improve the state of the economy. It is bad luck that your family faces a whole range of other increases in costs as
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a result of its budget cuts. We know what they will have to pay for their medicines. We know what they will have to pay for child care. We know what they will have to pay if one of their elderly family members has to get into a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we know what they will have to pay if they have a young adult living at home who cannot find a job because of this government's ineptitude, because this government has no idea about how to fix youth unemployment. The only way it thinks youth unemployment can be fixed is by taking the big stick to the young unemployed and saying to them, `Get out of the way. Do not be seen on the unemployment statistics. If you are 18, 19 or 20 years old and you are still counted on the unemployment statistics, we will basically take away your self&hyphen;respect and your ability to stand up and make a contribution to your family.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is taking the big stick to low and middle income families&mdash;not to wealthy families&mdash;who cannot afford to lose $60 a fortnight, $120 a fortnight or $210 a fortnight. That is exactly what this government is saying to Australian families. It is giving them no hope. It is just taking out the big stick.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point I thought she was trying to make about the way in which this issue was being dealt with was that there was some manipulation of employment statistics by this measure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are about meaningful change, and what needs to be understood is what this measure has undertaken. This measure ensures that from 1 July we will have a single youth allowance which will provide income support to young people, including students, those who are looking for work and those who are sick. It replaces five different program payments which are in place now: Austudy for 16&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and certain 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, newstart allowance for 16&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and certain 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, a new training allowance for 16&hyphen; to 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and certain 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, the sickness allowance for 16&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and certain 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, and the more than minimum rate family payment for secondary students aged 16 to 18 not obtaining Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was the range of payments which had been severely criticised and I think constitute the very reason why the Brotherhood of St Laurence, in its statement today, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Brotherhood of St Laurence has welcomed the news that young people forced to live away from

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think you picked up the items that were mentioned by them, but let me just go through and deal with the further matters that are involved. It is important to note that this is not a savings measure. You would think, from the speech of the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), that we were about reducing government expenditure by these changes. What we have done is to introduce a youth allowance in which the government is helping young people by making income support arrangements simpler and more flexible. We have reduced the five payments to one and 13 different rates of payment to five. Customers will no longer be cancelled and have to reclaim different payments for minor changes in circumstances. It will be more effective in responding to the changing labour market by taking into account the full range of training and employment activities available for young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance removes the disincentive to study caused by differences in income support arrangements for young people under 21 years of age. For younger students in particular, it creates a real incentive to complete year 12 or the equivalent qualification before they look for work. It reinforces the government's message that families should
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5629"> support young people until they have achieved financial independence. It provides more assistance to young people who need to live away from home to study or to look for work, especially those from rural areas. As I mentioned in question time there are numbers of people who gain very significantly&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is important to note in relation to this matter is that most people will not be facing changed circumstances and over 100,000 people benefit as a result of the changes that are made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For full&hyphen;time students, currently Austudy recipients: around 70 per cent of the youth allowance population will gain. Seventy per cent of students who have to live away from home will qualify for rent assistance. Seventeen thousand students will benefit from a more lenient, independent assessment criteria than is now applied under Austudy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forty&hyphen;one thousand will gain from abolition of the minimum entitlement of over $1,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people aged under 18 years living away from home will receive a higher rate of payment and rent assistance would be available. This would include young people who are exempt from the requirement to be in full&hyphen;time study or training. All students will now have access to the $500 loan advance currently available under newstart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are very significant and very beneficial changes which, in overall effect, leave the vast majority of young people&mdash;378,000&mdash;unaffected, and 137,000 better off. If we look at those who are receiving reduced amounts, the numbers pale into insignificance in comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the situation. If young people are not able to access other forms of education&mdash;some comments were made about the extent to which educational opportunities may be available&mdash;if it is shown that those opportunities are not available, the young people will still be able to continue to access the range of benefits. Without even questioning whether or not the honourable member is right in relation to the allegations that she makes&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's highest priority is to provide young people with jobs. We have made that point.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Jagajaga, in her comments, was endeavouring to suggest that this government in some way was not inter
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5630"> ested in families. Let me make it very clear that this government is interested in families and we have put a great deal of emphasis on assisting families. If you look at the last budget, our family tax initiative will allow eligible families&mdash;including couples and single&hyphen;parent families&mdash;to receive a $1,000 additional increase in the tax&hyphen;free threshold for each dependent child aged under 18 years. Families with one child are eligible if their income is up to $70,000. With each extra dependent child under 18, the income limit rises by $3,000. In short, a typical single&hyphen;income family with three kids, of whom one is under five, will be better off by over $1,100 a year than they were under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the range of other programs in which the government has been involved, you will find that they are about supporting families. This contrasts with the sorts of speeches I was making in this House while Labor was in office when the rich got richer and the poor got poorer and when families went backwards. That was the outcome under the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have studies which demonstrate that that was the case. We have had the Henderson work on welfare and inequality, the Social Policy Research Centre work by Henderson and Jensen, the OECD study on social and economic inequalities and the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. All of these studies that came out between 1993 and 1995 focused on the Labor Party's period of tenure and found increasing inequality of income between the poorest and richest Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This work is confirmed by Professor Gregory of the Australian National University, who analysed data from 1976 to 1991. That is largely the period in which the former government had been in office. He found that, in that time, the richer suburbs' household incomes had increased by 23 per cent and the poorer suburbs' household incomes had fallen by 23 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was the neglect that we saw under the former government. This government has been about redressing those matters. We have had positive changes in a wide range of areas. It is not a bandaid approach; it is a holistic
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> approach focusing on the problems and not trying to simply cure them in the way in which the former Labor Party sought to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is taking a broader view. We have seen a range of areas in which changes have occurred which impact directly on supporting and maintaining families. There is the youth homeless pilot project, the parenting education program, youth activity services and the national youth suicide prevention program. I could spend time going through each of those, outlining them in a very positive way, but I think in the context of this debate it is important that I take the opportunity to reiterate what it is that we are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very significant change that we have announced. The Labor Party was asked to focus on&mdash;and I was on committees when it was asked this over and over again&mdash;a situation where you would have a single payment with a similar range of payments for people, whether they were in the social security system or the education system.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applying the parental means test to dependent young people under 21, not in full time education, reinforces the message that families should support young people until they have achieved financial independence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What a load of rubbish!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is fine if Australia consisted of 100 per cent functional families where mum and dad were deeply in love and the relationship had a solid foundation, where parents had the financial wherewithal to cater for their children's needs and where education was valued and children were fully supported to continue on to year 12. These families might have be in the majority in the years gone by, but those opposite must be smoking the weed if they honestly believe that this is the way Australian society is in 1997. If you are really honest, you will know that dysfunctional families are an ever increasing reality and those I mentioned earlier are under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, this proposed legislation is yet further evidence of the mean bastardry of those in power in Canberra&mdash;people who have lost touch with the reality of what is really happening in the suburbs of the low and middle income families of Australia. Who was leading the charge in depriving Tasmania's youth of benefits and placing Tasmanian low and middle income families really under the hammer? It was none other than Senator Jocelyn Newman&mdash;a Tasmanian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I heard of this draconian measure, my mind immediately turned to the dozens of families of former students of mine who would be hurt, and cruelly so, by this legislation. This is what it is all about: individual young people, real teenagers, who, because of circumstances beyond their control and that of their parents, are now being punished by this uncaring and poll-driven Liberal government. In honesty, all of us must be able to recount
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5632"> numerous examples, which are being dealt with daily by our electorate staff, of families and their teenage children under extreme pressure. Imagine what trials and tribulations they are going to face in the coming 12 months as a result of this draconian legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the minister want to see happen in Tasmania? She wants to see all of the 16- and 17-year-olds currently receiving the dole to re-enter the education system. It sounds find in theory, but examine it closely to see what a nightmare they are about to unleash on the Tasmanian education system. It would be fine if those teenagers were keen and enthusiastic about returning to senior secondary college or entering it for the first time, but all of us know that the reason many of them have quit the education system is because of the stresses already facing their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Imagine, if you will, having 500 of these teenagers&mdash;that is the number in my electorate at the moment who are going to be disadvantaged&mdash;turn up at Rosny, Hobart, Claremont or Elizabeth College. They would say, `We are here because, unless we stay here for two years, the benefits from the federal government will cease. We don't qualify for work for the dole, and there are no opportunities for us to gain meaningful employment. Here we are.' These colleges, as you all know, are flat chat trying to cope with ensuring that the students currently enrolled are able to fully benefit from the courses offered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke today with one of Australia's leading educators, Greg Suitor, Principal of Elizabeth College in Hobart, and asked him briefly about his views on the changes proposed by the minister. He was absolutely appalled. He believes that the moves will be not only very detrimental to the educational outcome of the children in his care&mdash;he said that his college and the others in Tasmania are bursting at the seams&mdash;but, having more students enrolled, especially many who clearly do not want to be at college, will create more behavioural problems and more conflict in his and the other educational institutions. Not only that, but there will be a devaluation of education, as teachers attempt to come to terms with providing educational programs for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these new students as well as serving those already under the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am amazed at the minister. If she is really concerned with the educational outcomes of these teenagers who are currently outside the system, why would she introduce such a move in the middle of the school year? Where is the logic in this? It is unbelievable. Has the minister and her department so little contact with the real world that they have forgotten when schools actually function? This reflects the truth behind what this measure is all about&mdash;punishing low and middle income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania has an appalling retention rate in the high 50s. It is the worse unemployment rate in the country and one of the highest youth unemployment rates. Our young people are leaving in droves. For the first time since 1941, Tasmania has a negative population growth. In order for people to enter for the first time or, in many cases, re-enter the secondary college system, there has to be some incentive or some benefit at the end. The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) would have you believe that everything will be rosy. He keeps replaying his CD single `Setting the conditions'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than the cruel and heartless coercion formulated by this government, which will really have a devastating impact on the many low and middle income families in Franklin and throughout Australia, we need a more fair and equitable approach to this complex issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that those opposite have trotted out the Brotherhood of St Laurence as a justification for the positive aspects of this new proposal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Those opposite want to extend the bewilderment that the current plethora of payments to young people presents. This proposal is about replacing five payments with one and replacing 13 different payment levels with five. Those opposite want to preserve the financial disincentive in the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5634"> current system for young people to pursue schooling and training to prepare themselves to develop the tools within themselves for a more positive outlook for their future. That is about building a capacity within themselves so that they can enjoy the opportunities that this country will undoubtedly offer in continuing volumes under a coalition government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor it was more attractive to a young person to be on the dole than to spend some time investing in themselves through study or training, because of their access to unemployment benefits, rent assistance and advances. We have sought to address that, but Labor wants to deny young people working toward their future the advantages of this package. It is disgraceful. On average we are talking about an advantage from this package of up to $100 per fortnight for rural and regional young Australians, and yet those opposite sit there and try to tell us that we are not interested in the young Australians doing it hard in this community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor oppose incentives for young people to improve  their skills. They are the champions of churning young people through a system without offering them any great hope. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) talks about youth unemployment. Need I remind her that, thanks to the Keating&hyphen;Beazley recession, youth unemployment rose from 27 per cent when they came into office to a staggering 34.9 per cent. Under Labor, the apprentice and traineeship levels fell to the lowest level, as a percentage of the work force, in three decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Franklin talked about his staff talking to his constituents. I actually talk to mine direct, because I find that is the best way of being in touch with what they are doing. Let me share with you one of the things they say. Some parents came into my office saying, `Bruce, could you help us talk to our son?' My constituents ran their own business and had an apprenticeship opportunity for their son, but the son was not interested. The son was saying, `Basically, I'm better off being unemployed than taking up your apprenticeship.' The reason is that the salary that was available under that apprenticeship could not match the unemployment benefits.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The parents said to me, `Bruce, what can we do to encourage our young people to think about their future and to stop for a minute and appreciate that perhaps forgoing a little bit of income or comfort in the short term is well worth it in the long term?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something I understand. Do you know how I started? I started by emptying parking meters in the City of Frankston just to get a start in life. That start was an opportunity. I though that while that was going on I could study and invest in my future. That is the sort of signal, the sort of message, that this package sends to young Australians. That is something that is being lost entirely by those opposite. This is about principle, good policy and programs to support its implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga seems more worried about the incomes of people in pinball parlours and others who benefit from young directionless people wondering what to do with the money in their pockets and the time on their hands. We are interested in the future of young people and in giving them a structure that they can work with so as to invest in their future. Contrast Labor's headline hunting with the coalition's plans for young people. This government has principles and policies in the programs it is putting in place to give young people more confidence about their future. We are seeking to address the failings of the current system and encourage young people to invest in their future. We are focusing on the causes of problems facing young people, not just the symptoms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government has clearly demonstrated its highest priority is towards young people, finding them work and giving them an opportunity for a brighter future. The youth allowance is designed to change the incentives that made investing in your future less attractive than being unemployed. Early school leavers who leave secondary education at year 10 are three times more likely to be unemployed than somebody who finishes their secondary education. Just think about that: they are three times more likely to be unemployed. We are saying to people, `Think
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5635"> about your futures and send the right signals through the policy structure that we are implementing.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance is an important social reform. It is tackling the concerns that have been expressed to coalition members and ministers by young people, families and the general community about the inefficiencies and confusing messages the current system sends. It is about income support for young Australians who need that support. It is about those who are investing time in education and training and who, through no fault of their own, have opportunities denied them. We are saying, `Let's reinvest in your future.' I think young people will respond positively to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is just part of a comprehensive plan about young people in our country. This is not just one issue; it is another part of a comprehensive plan this government is putting in place for young people in this country. We have got a youth suicide initiative: $31 million has been committed to the national youth suicide prevention strategy. We have got the Green Corps. We have got JPET, the job placement employment and training program that Minister Vanstone launched in my electorate. It tackles some of the most disadvantaged people in our community. Those opposite, including the member for Jagajaga, like to talk about this as if nothing else is going on in the world. What a ridiculous way to approach government!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has got a comprehensive program which it is offering to young people. It includes specific programs targeted to the needs of young people whose circumstances make them less able to take advantage of the opportunities available to them. We have the youth homeless pilot, and national youth week is on its way. We are investing in youth culture through the Loud program. We have got the work for the dole initiative. Young offenders have got some support from this government. We have got the family tax initiative. We have invested in family and relationship counselling. The member for Franklin alluded to the causes of breakdowns in relationships and families: we are investing in that as well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have additional money going into schools. And those opposite want to talk about people who are not of a mind to go into education, but they did nothing about them. We have the school to work apprenticeship opportunities. We have opportunities for people to study and get some vocational training. It might be 60 per cent of young people who do not go on to tertiary education, but it is higher than that in my electorate; it is higher in Dunkley. And they really appreciate that we are putting some effort into those young people who are not scholastically minded but who quite rightly believe that the government should be helping them with their start in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you have a comprehensive program that the coalition is offering, and this is just part of it. There will be 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in the coming year. We have more places in TAFE. We have overenrolment in universities. This is an exciting time for young people. And this again is part of a package from which they can look towards a better future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone on newstart allowance and sickness benefits yesterday will not have their payments affected. That seems to have been lost on those opposite. They talk about the means test that we are implementing. It is actually more generous than the Labor Party had. They are just a bit confused about fact and about chasing headlines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite distressing that the best thing the member for Jagajaga can do is carp, carp, carp. It is like `Retro&hyphen;Jagajaga'. She thinks about the past, looks backward. Even when she said that this is a sting in the tail, again it was a case of looking backwards at your tail, looking around for bees. We are actually trying to illuminate a path where you can avoid the bees in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I close with one simple message to the young people. I encourage you to think about your future. The government is, Ministers Vanstone, Kemp and Newman are, putting in place programs to help young people. Think carefully about the choices you make, because you carry them with you for the rest of your life. This is a very good part of a comprehensive program. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to conclude the remarks I was making prior to question time with respect to this group of amendments. They relate to the fact that as the Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill stands at the moment the government would be able to proceed with the establishment of the Track Authority with respect to the interstate main line track without further reference to this parliament. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving aside all of the other matters that the opposition has raised on the proposed privatisation of Australian National, it is very clear in our view that the parliament needs to be able to properly consider and establish a legislative base for the proposed Track Authority. It involves the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars of Commonwealth money. At this stage, we do not have any details of the proposed nature of the authority, the framework within which it will operate or the arrangements it will put in place for the access and maintenance of the track, and the way it will conduct its operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has moved four amendments, all of which have the net effect of removing the track from within the purview&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5637">the ambit&mdash;of this particular legislation. So, unlike the other aspects of the bill which, as the bill stands, would ensure that the two  ministers can deal with those parts of Australian National and the various legislative instruments which give effect to them in any way that they think fit, the government is obliged to return to the parliament at the appropriate time with legislation to establish the Track Authority for the maintenance, operation and upgrading of that track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate my concern on the broader framework of this legislation: that is, it seeks essentially to delegate all of the parliament's legislative powers to the executive. It raises some interesting questions about the relationship between the executive and the legislature and the separation of powers. It seeks, in effect, to abrogate all of the legislature's involvement in decision making for a major part of Commonwealth power and to hand it all intact to the executive&mdash;namely, the two ministers nominated in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to speculate about what would occur if this principle were to spread. We could conceivably get to a situation where the attendance of members at this parliament became less than relevant because there was very little business for the parliament to deal with as all the powers to legislate on matters that are commonly dealt with by this parliament had been handed over to ministers. In my view it sets a particularly bad precedent. It stands in stark contrast to the approach taken by the government over the privatisation of Australia's major airports. Very detailed legislation was put in place and a whole range of issues dealt with, including the regulatory framework and arrangements for the future operation of those airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the most specific aspect of the legislation which requires excision. The opposition maintains its opposition to the broad principle of the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is committed to establishing a national rail infrastructure entity to control and manage access to the national interstate
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rail network. This commitment is clear from the rail reform package announcement; from the second reading speech of the Australian National Rail Commission Sale Bill; and from the significant long&hyphen;term budget provision for capital upgrading of the track, which will involve $185.2 million to the year 2001.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states support the entity and discussions with them on the nature of the entity and its establishment are continuing. The transport industry has made representations to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) supporting the urgent need for the establishment of the entity. The bill provides the minister with the powers and flexibility to move quickly to establish an interstate track entity following agreement with the states. He has provided a commitment that he will keep parliament informed of progress in the establishment. The ALP amendments would reduce this flexibility, leading to potential delays until further legislation is introduced and passed by parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These delays will result in continuing uncertainty and instability for participants in the rail industry, delaying private sector take&hyphen;up of rail opportunities and industry jobs growth. Simply, we believe that these amendments are designed to further obstruct the reform process. On that basis, we do not accept them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again urge the Labor Party to review their decision on the AN sale. There is $20 million going into Tasmania and South Australia to try to help those communities, displaced workers and everyone involved in this industry to get back on track again. They are important and widespread projects and have been put together&mdash;consultations are taking place&mdash;with the relevant communities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate at this stage that there are some 38 amendments, which are being circulated, that I will be moving, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, to the Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Bill. These amendments go to one thing. The bill in its present form seeks to amend the Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Act to allow non&hyphen;judicial officers to issue warrants. It is basically that part of this bill that the opposition opposes. We support the other parts of the bill. The 38 amendments really go to that one issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will be pursuing this issue. We will divide on this matter and we will strenuously argue the matter in the Senate should the government not accept these amendments. The Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5639"> Williams), in his second reading speech, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, interception warrants may be issued by an eligible judge of a court created by this parliament. An eligible judge is one who has been nominated by the responsible minister, after having consented to perform the function.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes to provide for categories of persons, in addition to judges, who may be authorised to issue warrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are necessary because the eligible judges of the Federal Court have decided that they should no longer perform this function. I understand the judges have expressed a quite proper concern that the workload involved should not interfere with the performance of their judicial duties. In addition, there is a more fundamental issue involved. The High Court has recently indicated that the use of judges as designated officials to perform certain administrative functions may be incompatible with the judicial function, as it can undermine public confidence in the independence and integrity of the judiciary. The High Court has also specifically advised some judges against agreeing to issue interception warrants, because of the risk that the judge may subsequently be involved in a related proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What concerns me is that, on the face of it, the Attorney-General seemed to indicate in his second reading speech that this is coming from the judges themselves. The validity of the legislation was decided in the recent High Court case of Bruno Grollo, the applicant, and Michael John Palmer, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, and others, the respondents. A judgment in that case was delivered in the High Court on 21 September 1995. I have the unreported judgment in front of me. That is the judgment I will be quoting from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a court of six: Chief Justice Brennan and Justices Deane, Dawson, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow. There was a judgment issued by Chief Justice Brennan and Justices Deane, Dawson and Toohey joined in that judgment. I think it is worth while to go to the judgment because it actually nails the misconceptions that I think the Attorney-General is putting into the marketplace as to the necessity for these amendments. It really goes to the crux of why we in the opposition
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are moving these amendments. At the moment, the act states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those powers are now expressed to be conferred not on all Judges of the Federal Court but only on "a person who is" a Judge of a court created by the Parliament and who has consented to be nominated as an eligible Judge and who has been declared by the Minister to be an eligible Judge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The act was amended. Section 6D(1) of the current act reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">6D. (1)</EMPHASIS>  In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"eligible Judge"</EMPHASIS>  means a Judge in relation to whom a consent under subsection (2) and a declaration under subsection (3) are in force; <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"Judge"</EMPHASIS>  means a person who is a Judge of a court created by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(2)</EMPHASIS>  A Judge may by writing consent to be nominated by the Minister under subsection (3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(3)</EMPHASIS>  The Minister may by writing declare Judges in relation to whom consents are in force under subsection (2) to be eligible Judges for the purposes of this Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is important because they are amendments that were introduced and went through the parliament as a result of earlier cases. The judgment reveals that in practice the system of eligible judges has resulted in the conferring of power to issue warrants on 30 of the 35 judges of the Federal Court. Pages 17 to 20 of the joint judgment, which I will quote from extensively because it lays it all out, basically encapsulates all the concerns and puts into perspective why we will move the amendments that we will move and why the situation should remain the same. The joint judgment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the argument can be met by the adoption of an appropriate practice. A Judge who has issued a warrant in a particular matter can ensure that he or she does not sit on any case to which the warrant relates. That is the practice followed when a Judge has received information extra&hyphen;curially which might prove embarrassing to the impartial hearing and determination of a case. Of course, the risk of such a situation arising and, in particular, of a Judge discovering late in the day that he or she had issued a warrant on the basis of which evidence is to be tendered, is increased when there are but few Judges appointed to a Court.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The answer is to appoint more judges. If that is a problem then create more judges. It continues:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5640">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Australian Capital Territory, for example, it would be prudent for a resident Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory not to accept an appoint. But that is a matter for individual Judges.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The legislation allows for that. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mistretta</EMPHASIS> &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and the citation is (1989) 488 US at 407&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We are somewhat more troubled by [the] argument that the Judiciary's entanglement in the political work of the Commission undermines public confidence in the disinterestedness of the Judicial Branch. . . . The legitimacy of the Judicial Branch ultimately depends on its reputation for impartiality and non-partisanship. That reputation may not be borrowed by the political Branches to cloak their work in the neutral colors of Judicial action."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The joint judgment then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the issuing of interception warrants were reasonably to be regarded as a judicial participation in criminal investigation, it would be a function which could not be conferred on a Judge without compromising the judiciary's essential separation from the executive government. The judicial method of deciding questions in controversy has no application in exercising the power to issue an interception warrant. Not only is the application for an interception warrant made ex parte; the very issue of a warrant and the identity of the Judge who issued it are not disclosed. Unlike a warrant to enter, search and seize, its execution may go undetected by the person against whom or against whose interests the warrant is executed. Unlike a warrant to enter, search and seize, there is no return made on the execution of the warrant which permits a determination of its lawfulness, a review of its due execution and a disposition of the fruit of the execution. Because of the secrecy necessarily involved in applying for and obtaining the issue of an interception warrant, no records are kept which would permit judicial review of a Judge's decision to issue a warrant. Nor are reasons given for such a decision. The decision to issue a warrant is, for all practical purposes, an unreviewable in camera exercise of executive power to authorise a future clandestine gathering of information. Understandably, a view might be taken that this is no business for a Judge to be involved in, much less the large majority of the Judges of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But here is the crux. The judgment goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet it is precisely because of the intrusive and clandestine nature of interception warrants and the necessity to use them in today's continuing battle against serious crime that some impartial authority,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accustomed to the dispassionate assessment of evidence and sensitive to the common law's protection of privacy and property (both real and personal), be authorised to control the official interception of communications. In other words, the professional experience and cast of mind of a Judge is a desirable guarantee that the appropriate balance will be kept between the law enforcement agencies on the one hand and criminal suspects or suspected sources of information about crime on the other. It is an eligible Judge's function of deciding independently of the applicant agency whether an interception warrant should issue that separates the eligible Judge from the executive function of law enforcement. It is the recognition of that independent role that preserves public confidence in the judiciary as an institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other countries the same view has been taken of the desirability, if not the necessity, for judicial issuing of a warrant to authorise secret surveillance of suspects in criminal cases. In such cases, the European Court of Human Rights said in Klass v <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Federal Republic of Germany</EMPHASIS> &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the citation is (1978) 2 EHRR 214 at 235&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Court considers that, in a field where abuse is potentially so easy in individual cases and could have such harmful consequences for democratic society as a whole, it is in principle desirable to entrust supervisory control to a judge."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The judgment goes on further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the United States, the Fourth Amendment protection "against unreasonable searches and seizures" has been held to require prior judicial warrant authorising electronic surveillance. In the United States v <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</EMPHASIS> , the court said&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the citation is (1972) 407 US 297 at 317&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Fourth Amendment contemplates a prior judicial judgment, not the risk that executive discretion maybe reasonably exercised."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Court used the word "judicial" "to connote the traditional Fourth Amendment requirement of a neutral and detached magistrate".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on the judgment goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Canada, Estey J referred to "the vitality of the role of the court in the legislative plan as the guardian of the public interest" when discussing the legislation which authorised interception of communications. The statute law of New Zealand provides for judicial warrants for the interception of private communications. So did the laws of most of the Australian States and Territories. The function conferred on Judges of the Federal Court under the Act, being similar in nature to the function conferred on Judges of the Federal Court
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5641"> under the Act prior to the 1987 Amendment, "is not incompatible with their status and independence or inconsistent with the exercise of their judicial power". Nor is their present function inconsistent with the maintenance of public confidence in the discharge by the judiciary of its responsibilities in the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When you look at the judgment of the High Court in Grollo&mdash;there was the joint judgment  of four; then there was a separate judgment by Justice McHugh who dissented, who thought it was inappropriate, and then Justice Gummow did a separate judgment as well, he went with the majority&mdash;the court decided 5:1 that it is appropriate that judges do this. We understand that there is a bit of a problem in the sense of the workload but you can overcome that by appointing extra judges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alternatively, you do not need extra judges. The way the legislation has been amended and is currently framed you can designate particular judges to perform this duty so that you can have a panel of judges within the Federal Court who consent to do this. That way you will not have a situation where they should be doing the trials in particular instances. But it retains the confidence of the community because of judicial involvement, as the joint majority judgment that I just read out pointed out. It is because of the intrusive nature of this power and the potential for abuse that we are moving the amendments to say, `No, we in the Labor Party will not support a further watering down of this power. We want judges to perform this role. It has been tested and resolved in the High Court of Australia. The legislation has been upheld.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect, the Attorney-General was being a bit disingenuous in his second reading speech. By going to the primary source, Grollo's case, we see where the joint judgment points that out and, frankly, endorses that. I will go back to the particular paragraph, on page 18, and repeat it because it is important:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet it is precisely because of the intrusive and clandestine nature of interception warrants and the necessity to use them in today's continuing battle against serious crime that some impartial authority, accustomed to the dispassionate assessment of evidence and sensitive to the common law's
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> protection of privacy and property (both real and personal), be authorised to control the official interception of communications. In other words, the professional experience and cast of mind of a Judge is a desirable guarantee that the appropriate balance will be kept between the law enforcement agencies on the one hand and criminal suspects or suspected sources of information about crime on the other.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And that is the case in other countries as well. That is why we will fight this to the last clause when it comes to a vote in this House and, more particularly, in the Senate. We think the government is wrong. It is unnecessary. We know it is not necessarily convenient and judges of the Federal Court might not like doing it, but the legislation as presently drafted requires their consent. We think that is the appropriate way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other parts of the act we are not unhappy with. We support the spirit of the other parts of the act. The opposition will support those other sections of the act which are designed, in effect, to deal with the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission and which also go to the permitted uses of intercepted information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Tuesday, 10 June 1997, officials appeared at the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs&mdash;which is worth quoting&mdash;and were asked questions by Senator Bolkus. At page 97, Senator Bolkus states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to start off with a telecommunications interception bill question. I noted when he introduced the legislation, the Attorney said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court has recently indicated that the use of judges as designated officials to perform certain administrative functions may be incompatible with the judicial function, as it can undermine public confidence in the independence and integrity of the judiciary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can you tell us what case he was referring to when he referred to the High Court indicating that?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Reaburn replied, `Grollo.' The truth is that, when you go to the judgment of the High Court in Grollo, it indicated exactly the reverse of what the Attorney&hyphen;General said in his second reading speech. Further on, Senator Bolkus says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the next sentence he states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court has also specifically advised some judges against agreeing to issue interception
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5642"> warrants, because of the risk that the judge may be subsequently involved in a related proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was that also Grollo?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Reaburn replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also Grollo and the judges were the judges in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is not what the High Court said in Grollo at all. It recognised that there could be problems in those jurisdictions, but there are  procedural ways to overcome those problems. Whoever prepared the speech for the Attorney-General is stretching it, because that is not what was decided in Grollo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court pointed out that these problems can be overcome. That is why the power in the current act is not conferred on all Federal Court judges and why there is section 6D, with its subsections. We say the problems that the government say are inherent in the system can be overcome by designating specific judges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there are not enough judges, then appoint extra judges, because there is no price in this country, nor should there be, on justice being done or being seen to be done. That is why this intrusive element that the government wants to now pass on to non-judicial officers will be resisted by the opposition. At page 98, Mr Reaburn says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court had some concerns but not about validity. It was not a question of validity; they just had some concerns. The High Court expressed concerns that, in particular instances, the action of choosing to be involved in the issuing of warrants could be incompatible in various ways with the exercise of judicial office. Those remarks were remarks that were made in the course of the judgments in Grollo in which the overall result was to say that the scheme for having judicial officers granting warrants of that kind was constitutionally valid.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is not what they said in Grollo. A proper reading of Grollo shows that what the court acknowledged was that the amendments that we introduced were adequate and that this was a valid exercise of power under the separation of powers. They did point out that there could be some problems with administrative matters, but that they could be overcome. They have been overcome by the 1987 amendments to the act. What we did was
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> repeal section 18 and insert section 6D. Page 11 of the judgment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Parliament eliminated the indiscriminate conferral of power on all Judges of the Federal Court and thereby sought to overcome a factor which Mason and Deane JJ had regarded as a source of invalidity. The 1987 Amendment also repealed s 20 and inserted in its place a number of provisions which conferred on an "eligible judge" (as defined by s 6D) powers to issue warrants authorising, inter alia, interceptions of communications. </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So let it not be said that the previous Labor government was impervious to criticisms or problems that might arise in this area. What we did was refine the act and bring in amendments&mdash;and we say that we improved it. There was also the earlier case of, I think it was, Hilton v. Wells. So this argument about constitutionality was raised squarely in Grollo's case, but the court decided 5:1. As to why the situation should remain the same, I think there is compelling material to be found in the joint judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, it is as a result of inconvenience, or some perceived inconvenience, that these amendments are being brought into the parliament. That is not the way to run a judicial system. That is not the way to maintain integrity in the system. These are intrusive powers that need to be exercised very cautiously. That is why we in the Labor Party say that we are not going to support those amendments that allow non-judicial officers to exercise those functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position is that the short appearance before the Senate legal committee and a proper reading of Grollo give no comfort and no support for what the government is doing; indeed, no comfort or support for what the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) said in his second reading speech. I am not saying that it is a deliberate overstatement. We in the opposition understand that some people are not happy with the current arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is: is it constitutional? Is it a proper exercise of powers? The High Court has already decided that. What we say to the government is: if you go down this path, if you further water it down to allow non-judicial officers, then the system itself will be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5643"> subject to further attack, will bring itself into disrepute, and you will lend comfort to those who say that it is an abuse of power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, there are 38 amendments that go to just that aspect of the bill. I repeat: in relation to other amendments to the act, we in the opposition support those other parts of the amendment bill. We believe that the government has made out a case, and that there is a case for those other amendments. Briefly, I will repeat what they are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Police Integrity Commission was established by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Police Integrity Commission Act 1996</EMPHASIS>  (NSW) to prevent and investigate police misconduct.

That is why the functions that they have had under the current act and that have been tested were given to them in the first place. What we want is integrity. We want people to be confident that these powers are being exercised properly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the remarks of the member for Banks (Mr Melham) in relation to the Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Bill 1997. I support the amendments that he intends to deal with in the consideration in detail stage. This legislation, like most other items of legislation that go to issues of policy in the criminal justice system, deals essentially with extremely complex and difficult balances that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5644"> our criminal justice system needs to strike between competing public interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is clearly a public interest in the deterrence of crime. There is a public interest in assisting to the maximum our law enforcement organisations with a capacity to detect crime and to obtain convictions. That set of public interests needs to be balanced with the fundamental importance of civil liberties of our citizens to prevent unreasonable intrusions on the rights of citizens and to prevent as much as possible the abuse of powers that can all too frequently arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, those balances are not easy matters. They are not stuck in concrete for all time. They are balances that need to be reworked, redeveloped and clarified as circumstances emerge. Issues such as community expectations have to be weighed up in these sorts of considerations. A good example of changes in community expectations on these issues was graphically given last year when, on a bipartisan basis, a much more rational system of firearms legislation occurred in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Things develop in terms of technological change. The very rapid advances over recent times in forensic science mean that there is a whole set of additional challenges in terms of striking these balances. These were matters that some of us spoke about in the recent debate on the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The capacity of criminals changes over time and moves with technological development. That is why this parliament needs to be continually monitoring the way in which the financial transactions report legislation operates and the proceeds of crime legislation operates, for example. However, in keeping in touch with the balances that are required, we also fundamentally need to be confident in the administration of our law enforcement effort. We need to be certain that the intrusions into citizens' lives and the potential for abuse that I referred to before are adequately balanced. That is why the points that were made by the member for Banks are so fundamentally important in this debate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Banks has indicated, the bill deals with a range of matters other than the proposition of allowing persons other than Federal Court judges to issue interception warrants, the proposal being to permit deputy presidents and senior members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue those warrants. As he has indicated, there is a range of amendments that support access by the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission to the Financial Transaction Reports Act established database through Austrac. It also gives the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence access to those reportable transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Banks indicated, I think there are amendments to the Customs Act which will permit the AFP and the NCA to communicate information to agencies that they have obtained by the use of listening devices. There is a range of amendments that relate to the use of intercepted information in bail applications, in relation to proceedings in coronial inquiries and in relation to the operation of the Commonwealth and state proceeds of crime legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of a slight diversion, the Proceeds of Crime Act is increasingly giving concern to some of our law enforcement agencies operating at a Commonwealth level. The Commonwealth act requires the conviction of a person, the charging of a person or the imminent laying of charges in respect of an indictable offence before an application for a restraining order can be made. In recent investigations, the National Crime Authority apparently was advised by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions that it was not possible to apply for a restraining order under the Commonwealth act but that they ought to go off and make an application under the New South Wales drug trafficking legislation. That is clearly an absurd situation which this parliament ought to tidy up as early as possible, given that the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) seems to have a penchant for introducing all sorts of amendments to legislation when he is dealing with this telecommunications interception legislation and other matters.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5645">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General ought to put his mind to the importance of some amendments to the proceeds of crime legislation in relation to tidying up the problems that Commonwealth agencies are having at the present time, as I have indicated. The most substantial change that the opposition supports, other than the relatively minor ones that I have already referred to, is the proposal arising out of the royal commission into the New South Wales police service&mdash;the Woods royal commission&mdash;in relation to the Police Integrity Commission obtaining a capacity to get telephone interception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think all sides of the House got a bit of a spray from the royal commissioner in relation  to this matter. In his report he indicates that he was particularly cheesed off with the length of time it has taken for this particular matter to arise. He vents his spleen at the inability to obtain in ways that he regarded as adequate access to interception material in the context of his inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would hope that, as a result of this legislation, those matters have now been put behind us and the capacity of this new commission in New South Wales to address the problems that seem endemic in the New South Wales Police Service with respect to corruption can be assisted by this parliament authorising the capacity of that commission to obtain the advantages associated with telecommunications interception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said all that in the areas that the opposition supports, I want to come back to the principal themes that the member for Banks referred to. I do not want to go over&mdash;as inevitably I would be less elegant than he was&mdash;the arguments that relate to why this parliament ought not to confer on people other than Federal Court judges the power to issue interception warrants. I would, however, quote some evidence that was given by Mr Rozenes, the Director of Public Prosecutions, last year to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which was considering the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996. Mr Rozenes had the following to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no comparison, in my view, between the role that is required to be performed by the grantor of the certificate in this investigative exercise&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">he was referring obviously to the controlled operations legislation which authorises a senior police officer to authorise&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with that which is reposed in the federal court judge, or the  magistrate, or whatever it is who gives a warrant for either listening devices, or search warrants, or anything else, where there is a clear requirement that there be balanced the interests of the citizen who is about to have his property turned upside down, his premises invaded, his body samples taken, or his voice listened to, monitored, reported and recorded, on the one hand, and law enforcement requirements on the other. There, there is genuine balancing of competing public interest which requires additional involvement. But even that is currently&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and this is somewhat old information&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the subject matter of challenge in the High Court . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As was indicated by the member for Banks, that issue in the High Court has, in our view, been satisfactorily resolved by a very clear majority judgment in the Grollo case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Traditionally, telecommunications interception warrants have been issued only by people who are judicial officers. The issuing of the warrants is an exercise of executive power vested in a person who happens to be a judicial officer. A  judicial officer may refuse to exercise the power if he or she so wishes. Traditionally, those officers have been selected because they possess certain skills and have judicial experience&mdash;the sort of experience that the member for Banks quoted the High Court judgment as. I cannot quite pick up the reference here. It was somewhat more eloquently presented than I am doing, but examples of the sorts of skills that a judge can be expected to have are neutrality, detachment, disinterestedness and an ability to receive evidence, assess its credibility, evaluate submissions upon it and reach conclusions conformable with the law and which are expressed with efficiency and promptness in a stated conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could be argued that the deputy presidents and the senior members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal may have some of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5646"> those skills, but it could also be argued that they lack experience in the criminal jurisdiction essential to the performance of those powers. It could also be very strongly argued that they lack the status and the standing in terms of community expectations for the quite significant powers that reside in judges. For those reasons, in getting those balances right that I referred to before, it is singularly important that community expectations and confidence be considered along with this. With the greatest respect, I do not think it is sustainable that the senior members of the AAT carry&mdash;at least in the opposition's view&mdash;what a judge carries in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General, in his second reading speech, presented two reasons for the proposal he is making. One of those, which I think was pretty pathetic, was a concern about a lack of  judicial resources. The answer to that issue is clearly to provide resources for the administration of justice if that is required. For the Attorney to be coming into this House to suggest that the standards of justice can be downgraded on those issues is fairly unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An examination of the budget that is being presented to this parliament shows that there is a significant squeeze in the Federal Court. My understanding is that the Federal Court's workload has increased by approximately four per cent and that the Family Court's workload has increased by approximately 10 per cent. Certainly there is pressure on judges, but that does not seem to me to be in any sense an argument for downgrading fundamental balances that are required in our system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reasons the Attorney gave, as the member for Banks has spent a great deal of time talking about, are the constitutional concerns&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FILING" NAMEID="QT4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QK6">Mr SERCOMBE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the member for Banks makes very good speeches, in my experience. He dispatched very well the misperceptions the Attorney has come to this parliament with about the Grollo case. The Attorney&hyphen;General also appeared, in his second reading speech, to be referring to the Wilson
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> case. That case, as I understand it, concerned the appointment of Justice Matthews to prepare a report in relation to the Hindmarsh Island bridge. In that case, all the judges noted that the issuing of telecommunications interception warrants was not an issue before the court and accepted previous authority on that subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the Attorney&hyphen;General in his second reading speech referred to advice provided by the Chief General Counsel in the context of the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996. However, I think once again that particular area of concern ought to be capable of being dispatched&mdash;and, I think, it has been dispatched in debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government's real concern is with constitutional issues, this legislation does not resolve those issues. It is caught out in terms of that point too. If there were constitutional impediments of the type the Attorney-General is suggesting, he would be amending the legislation much more dramatically&mdash;in fact, removing the right of judicial officers to issue interception warrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is not doing that; he is simply adding some additional people with the capacity to do that&mdash;presumably primarily for administrative convenience and as a fairly cheap cost saving exercise&mdash;and in the process, I would suggest, fundamentally getting wrong the balances that I started off this speech by referring to. He is for very cheap purposes&mdash;quite undignified purposes, I would suggest&mdash;really threatening to upset some fundamental balances in relation to the roles of judges in our criminal system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, I join with the member for Banks in opposing those aspects of the bill. I support the member for Banks's amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to start my contribution to this Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Bill 1997 by lamenting the answer to the question I asked in the House this morning in relation to the drug trafficking problems we have in this country because it relates to the telecommunications
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5647"> interception and listening device use by our law enforcement agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) would know, we heard very strong evidence, particularly from police personnel from Victoria, last week on the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority's inquiry into the effectiveness of the NCA about the extent of the problem in Victoria. We heard from the Queensland Police Commissioner's representative, representatives from the Western Australian and the South Australian police commissioners, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the minister's own adviser and a number of other sources, including Bob Bottom, a well-known commentator on criminal and other matters in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that you, Madam Deputy Speaker Sullivan, have indicated concerns about criminal elements that have occurred in your own electorate of Moncrieff on the Gold Coast&mdash;people who have extensive international criminal connections, who have appeared in Australia for the very first time and who have purchased quite expensive properties in your electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Victoria Police said in Melbourne last week which was of most concern was that there are now 12- to 14-year-olds selling heroin for $7 a pop in Little Bourke Street. They were talking about going to the extent of checking motor vehicles entering Victoria for illicit drugs, because they claim that the drugs are not produced in Victoria, they are coming in by road, air or other ways into their state. That may be an extreme response on the part of the Victoria Police, but to my way of thinking it goes to demonstrate clearly the seriousness of the drug problem in Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also heard from the Queensland Police Commissioner's representative that, as a consequence of the federal government's cutbacks in Western Australia in relation to the NCA, the AFP and Customs, there is now a conduit of drugs coming in via the Western Australian coast and coming across the country to the eastern states. That is another serious problem. The Western Australian
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Police Commissioner, Mr Falconer, has indicated that it is of crisis proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a number of heroin deaths in Western Australia way beyond the norm, indicating not only that there is a greater usage of heroin but also that the heroin entering the country now is of such greater purity that you see the sorts of overdoses that we have seen in recent times. Those overdose deaths have occurred in the eastern states as well; they have occurred on the east coast, in South Australia and elsewhere. They are indicative of this serious problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Smeaton, who has been an integral adviser to both the previous federal Labor government and the current government, appeared before the committee. Back in 1994 the federal government undertook a review of Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements. Amongst the things that they discovered as part of continuing and serious problems, in particular in relation to drug trafficking, was the presence of Chinese Triad gangs who were organising the importation of heroin to a very large extent. The ABCI, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, indicated that they were responsible for the vast majority of the importations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Irrespective of the background of the people responsible, that intelligence was known to the federal government some time ago. Why is it still a problem three years later? One of the reasons why is it a more serious problem now and why you can buy heroin for $7 almost completely openly in the street&mdash;and, the police told us, with virtually no means for them to do much about it at all&mdash;is that there have been substantial cutbacks. I know why the federal government has introduced cutbacks in these areas. It has introduced cutbacks because it had a substantial budget deficit inherited from the previous government. But the problem is that, when you adopt an across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board cut, irrespective of the effects, then you have the sorts of secondary effects like this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that many parents around the country&mdash;and I am sure a number of people would have seen the debate on television last night, I think, on Channel 7&mdash;would be at present
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5648"> greatly disturbed by the threat that drug trafficking and its sale within Australia on the streets present to the welfare and the safety of their own children, their own offspring. As a parent, who would not be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you hear from the Victoria Police that 12- to 14-year-olds are now trafficking drugs openly in the street at a price less than the price of a packet of cigarettes, then you have to wonder to what extent the drug problem has become in this country. I think the member at the table has commented in the committee hearings that heroin is now apparently the only drug made cheaper by the 1997 federal budget. What an irony that it is now cheaper to buy heroin than a packet of cigarettes. Any government that presides over that&mdash;Labor, Liberal or anything else&mdash;ought to be thoroughly ashamed of itself, because in the first instance it is the federal government that has the primary responsibility for preserving our frontiers from the incursion of drug trafficking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case, the work that has been undertaken to try to stem this flood of illicit drugs into Australia has been greatly undermined by the budgetary cuts introduced on two separate occasions by the incoming federal government, exacerbating cuts that were already made under the previous Minister for Justice, Mr Kerr, which was a matter of concern at a time. I have been consistent all the way through in this&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might just say to the member for Banks that unfortunately, under 13 years of Labor, the use of administrative appeal bodies and non-judicial appeal bodies has greatly ballooned to the extent now where there is just about an appeal body for every single possible permeation of complaint under the sun. I was going to say that he would know that that has created a number of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5649"> problems. We have a situation where some of these appeals tribunals operate like star chambers. In fact, some of them are so unjust in the way in which they administer themselves that one wonders whether they are, in fact, consistent with what we consider to be the principles of the derived version we have of the British justice system, which has become the Australian justice system. I know the member for Banks agrees with me there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly am worried about the fact that, in widening the scope of the issue of warrants, we now include people who are not judges. That is a thing that worries me considerably, because one of the great principles behind the issue of warrants is that there should be some very high standards of integrity and high standards of review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A judge sitting in his chamber issuing a warrant is acting as though he is in court. That means the whole process has to employ a very high standard of presentation. It means, for instance, that all of the complaint, the  application and the evidence to the judge are presumed to be of the same standard as that which would be presented in an open court of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that means there is an added onus on the officers applying for a warrant to present their case in a way which is consistent with the principles, and I think they are principles all members of parliament would accept, which are the basis for the issuing of intercept warrants. As a former policeman, I think telephone interception is a very critical part of high quality police investigative work, but at the same time, as a person who respects the privacy of citizens, I am loath to see the widening of the scope for the issuing of warrants under these sorts of circumstances. I must say that that is a matter which troubles me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The judges of the Federal Court have acted as an important element in the protection of the rights and privacy of Australian citizens and ensured that law enforcement agencies have been compelled to comply exactly with the legislative protections which apply. We know that from time to time there are variations on a theme of this, and individual
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> judges from time to time make different interpretations of their responsibilities. However, because it is in that category of that high standard of review, where the interests of a citizen are much better protected, that is where those warrants should be issued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is a problem with the workload of Federal Court judges, then it is up to the Attorney-General to appoint a larger number of federal judges. That would seem to me to be a much better response than extending it to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. For goodness sake! I know there are going to be some budgetary considerations here and all sorts of other Expenditure Review Committee type issues. However, in this case, in moving to extend the issue of these warrants, we really ought to be looking clearly at extending the number of Federal Court judges to allow them to be able to cope with their constant workload and, of course, the extra workload that is created by the application for and the consideration of warrants for interceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn to a number of other issues in relation to the interception warrants, one of which is that this bill contains a number of provisions relating to the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission, which was recently established as a permanent authority to continue the work of the Wood royal commission. The granting of these warrants or these powers to the Wood royal commission was one of the greatest facilitations by this parliament to the cause of fighting corruption, not only in the police forces but also in the judiciary in recent years because, as we know, one of the greatest tools used in the Wood royal commission was the use of things like pinhole cameras and telephone intercepts. Of course, it was the use of those in such a way that caused what is now colloquially known as the rolling over of witnesses and the compounding of this rolling over to identify and to locate and, hopefully, to prosecute those responsible for the corruption that has tainted the New South Wales police force over a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am just saying that we should not restrict this to the New South Wales situation. I think that, in the circumstances in Western Austral
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5650"> ia where there have been calls for a royal commission, there should be great scope to extend the powers offered to the PIC to the anti&hyphen;corruption commission in Western Australia. I do not think we should have a royal commission. In fact, my view is that, unfortunately, the Wood royal commission left a lot of questions unanswered. When you look at the cost and the number of people who were identified in the Wood royal commission, you realise it did leave a lot of things still out there needing to be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of people&mdash;I know that the member for Banks (Mr Melham) and a lot of his Labor colleagues in New South Wales would agree, and I know there would be a number of Liberal colleagues in the New South Wales parliament who would agree&mdash;that the Wood royal commission really did not go all the way along the path that it should have done. There are elements of allegations and aspects of the corruption allegations within the New South Wales police force that have not been resolved by the Wood royal commission and should have been. A standing commission is something that is necessary to continue the work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia's case, an anti&hyphen;corruption commission has been set up by the state government and been given considerable resources. I would like to see the anti&hyphen;corruption commission given the resources to conduct telephone interceptions and that sort of work so as to be able to get to the bottom of the allegations that have been made in relation to the Western Australian police force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Policing is a difficult enough job in Australia&mdash;it really is. We are now at the stage where literally every police officer undertaking their work, with the exception, perhaps, of some of the more administrative work, is out there investigating offences, responding to complaints, at the scene of a crime and then, of course, dealing with unfortunate and difficult circumstances. Often they are dealing with people who are injured and distressed and in inclement weather. There are situations where they have to secure a crime scene at great speed and speak to witnesses at great speed. There is a necessity to secure evidence
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as quickly as possible. The problem is that a police officer is acting under enormous stresses at the scene of a crime or at the scene of a complaint, and any review of his actions could take months. They are reviewed in the cool, perhaps more sedate atmosphere of the court or perhaps in the judge's chambers when the judge is reflecting on his decision, his ruling, in a particular case. It may be in, for instance, a voir dire when the judge is hearing the case for the inclusion or exclusion of a particular piece of confessional evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that police work has become more and more stressful. Police officers are, at times, the butt of opposition and criticism from the community when, perhaps, people who object to being arrested make it extremely difficult for them to conduct their work. They then have to deal with across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board allegations of corruption without the benefit of those allegations being properly dealt with as quickly as possible so as to put the matters at rest. In the case of Western Australia, one of the things I would like to see is these matters being dealt with by the anti&hyphen;corruption commission, with the ability to use telecommunications intercept listening device powers, as swiftly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telecommunications interception is a legitimate and important tool in the fight against drugs. I mentioned that the drug problem in this country is one of the most serious criminal threats to our community. I know it sometimes sounds a little alarmist, but as a parent you have to look at what is happening with the drug trafficking problem in Australia. You wonder to yourself whether law enforcement agents are really being given the resources to fight the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliament has a responsibility in this regard. In my view, the $13 million package that the Prime Minister released during the last sitting does not, unfortunately, go anywhere near addressing the problems we have. In my view, there should be a $100 million package to fight a fully&hyphen;fledged war against drug trafficking in this country and to properly resource the customs department, the Australian Federal Police, the National Crime Authority and, of course, to be able to undertake, in conjunction with state police forces,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5651"> the sort of long&hyphen;term investigative surveillance work that is absolutely critical to fighting these people. We are talking about millions, billions, of dollars. For instance, when the secretary&hyphen;general of Interpol came to Australia, he estimated the international drug trade as being worth $450 billion per annum. When you consider the distorting effect that has on any economy, even if you look at it from an economic rationalist point of view, as some on the government benches may do&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Crime is not a secondary issue; it is not something that can be swept aside as some sort of side issue. We have the problem of the minister not being a member of the cabinet, so there is not even a cabinet presence for the  Attorney&hyphen;General. That is unfortunate, because he is one of the best performers in the government. The enormous amount of money involved in drug trafficking has bred and fed corruption more than any other area of criminal activity&mdash;not just in the police force, but in all levels of officialdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Corruption has been shown to be endemic overseas among petty officials, the judiciary, politicians and police when enough can be paid in bribes. I do not accept that this situation is not possible in Australia. How can you expect police officers on $35,000, $42,000, per annum to be seriously equipped to fight the fight against drugs when we are dealing with what has been estimated to be anything between $2 and $5 billion worth of illicit drugs in Australia.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Moore (Mr Filing) said a lot about the increased use of heroin in his electorate, the need to continue the so&hyphen;called war on drugs and the consequential need, in his view, I suppose, for wire taps to be more easily available for law enforcement agencies. The clinical evidence is that heroin as a sub
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stance is certainly nowhere near as damaging in terms of mortality rates in the Australian community than are legally sanctioned drugs such as tobacco and alcohol. That is the reality of the situation. Far more people die from tobacco and alcohol in Australian society and far greater cost is imposed on the community through those two substances than through any of the illicit substances which we spend a lot of money on fighting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, security is a big concern for people communicating through modern technologies, for both personal privacy and hard&hyphen;nosed business reasons. Jeff Kennett found out what happens when communications systems, such as the analogue mobile phone he was using to make some pertinent points about members opposite, are the subject of easy interception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telephone intercepts is a debate about balancing the community demand for privacy with the real challenges that law enforcement and intelligence organisations face. We have accepted that private communications of citizens should prima facie not be subject to surveillance unless an approved officer orders otherwise. That is the broad assumption underlying this bill, notwithstanding the debate about what the approved officer may be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not condone industrial spying by way of private wire taps. However, in the emerging technology of the Internet, the same degree of privacy that we might like to enjoy on the telephone system is extremely problematic. Any technically competent individual with a modem and a reasonable grounding in UNIX can intercept electronic mail and Web transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very serious issue for two principal reasons. The first and obvious concern is privacy. Citizens send personal e&hyphen;mails to friends and relatives, and they should be able to do so without a fear of them being intercepted by smart but unkind individuals. In addition, organisations are increasing their use of the Internet as a method of transmitting information. Lawyers and doctors are sending confidential information to each other about clients and patients over the Net. It is essen
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5652"> tial that this personal information is not intercepted and used maliciously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second serious but less considered implication for security issues in relation to the Internet is the limit that insecure networks place on commercial development. Small business in Australia stands to gain substantially if, and only if, consumers are confident that their credit card and other personal details are secure and are not intercepted and used for wrongful purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is particularly the case when we see repeated stories of stolen credit and personal details sourced from insecure Net transactions or sites. Many people on the Net will not use their credit card to order services or products because of this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So consumers do not feel confident about using the Net for commerce, and small business suffers. Because Australians have the highest take&hyphen;up rate of new technology per capita in the world, there is a credible argument that says that Australian small business suffers the most. Privacy on the Net, therefore, is not only one of the largest IT issues; it is one of the largest issues for those small  businesses that would like to use emerging technologies to market their respective products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a solution to these issues, and it does not actually require much government action or many resources at all. Sophisticated encryption products fix the privacy problem. Good encryption products scramble messages so that  sensitive information about people's personal details and their commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence information cannot be intercepted by some kid with a modem and a bit of knowledge of UNIX. It keeps that information safe from malicious eyes, because it scrambles it to render that information unintelligible to those without the keys to decipher it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, intelligence agencies have become a little concerned that their ability to peruse the personal interactions of citizens will become compromised if they cannot decrypt the contents of e&hyphen;mails and commercial transactions. Those agencies have successfully convinced governments to prohibit
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the export of encryption products that the agencies themselves cannot decipher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, what agencies can decipher others can too. The United States have adopted a standard which they insist is safe yet provides consumers with confidence that their information is not decryptable but also provides agencies with an ability to decrypt information in a legitimate capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The standard adopted by the United States and security agencies elsewhere, not surprisingly, is a poor standard; it has been shown to be unreliable. A number of studies, including those produced by Belcore and the Weisman Institute, have shown that the American encryption export standard is decryptable. Even students from MIT have been able to successfully decrypt within a couple of hours e&hyphen;mails that have been encrypted with that particular standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Put simply, personal or commercially sensitive information that is encrypted using software the Americans approve for export can be intercepted and decrypted by teenagers. So consumers lack the faith that successful Net commerce or successful expansion of commerce on the Net requires. It is a legitimate concern that consumers have about this emerging technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument then becomes how good the encryption product may be. There is an Australian small business, as fortune or, rather, hard work would have it, that has delivered a solution to the problem. A small business in the electorate of Grayndler has come up with an encryption product that is a recognised world leader. With a bit of indulgence, I will just explain why it is a world leader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> described it as ideal for sending files over the Internet. The APC said in January 1997 that it offered an unequalled level of protection. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PC Week </EMPHASIS>in November 1996 said that it was `beating the pants off the overseas competition'. Of course, it was beating the pants off the overseas competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The company that developed the product is called Nexus Solutions. Who has been ob
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5653"> structing this new technology every step of the way? Not surprisingly, it is its international competitor, but, somewhat surprisingly, it is also the Australian government. Nexus Solutions, which is based in Grayndler, as I have said, has developed its product relying on a 447&hyphen;bit key, resulting in a combination possibility of one billion times 10 to the power 481. That is a pretty big number of combination possibilities. To put it another way, it would take around 2,000 to 3,000 years to decrypt an e&hyphen;mail encrypted using this encryption product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nexus landed a very large contract to sell thousands and thousands of site licences to the World Health Organisation. The Australian government would not let them fulfil the contract, using the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulation 13E Dual Use Technology Controls. It acted to prevent the Australian small business from exporting a product to fulfil a contract it had landed with the World Health Organisation. This was despite the frequent and capable representations made on their behalf by the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese). Why the Australian government feels that it needs to maintain a capacity to snoop on the World Health Organisation is, frankly, absolutely and utterly beyond me  and, no doubt, probably beyond the World Health Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The company certainly lost export dollars. Nexus then tried to sell their product to the Australian government itself. To do this they were advised that they would have to get their product approved by the government. The process is that the software has to be tested and `rubber stamped' to go on the list for departments to buy from. The government has outsourced the testing of security software to a foreign company. It is an American company called CSC. That company, surprisingly, also happens to sell encryption software. So here we have a foreign market competitor being asked to test the Australian product. Who pays for the testing? The Australian small business, Nexus. The overall cost imposed by the overseas competitor for rubber stamping the Australian underdog product ends up being around $250,000. This is a product that sells for around $250 per twin&hyphen;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">site unit. The company might make a very small margin for such a very large outlay being asked, under the authority of the Commonwealth government, by the competitor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Worse still is yet to come for our small businessman in Grayndler. He is asked to hand over the source code of his product to his competitor. Those of us who know a little about computer software and innovation would be aware that being asked to hand your source code over to your competitor is about as senseless as it comes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian battler then manages to get financial backing for the testing, which only provides him with the opportunity to sell his product. That is, he gets backing of some $250,000 to get the product tested so that he might be able to sell it. But the government then tells him that they will not be able to get around to it, that they will not have time to have his product tested by this third party overseas. After some time and interaction, the government, through the office of the Defence Signals Directorate, agrees to allow the testing to take place, only if the small business can get a letter from a couple of departments saying that they will buy the product. Of course, the departments cannot provide a letter saying that they are going to buy a product that they cannot find on the list of approved purchases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go to the letter from Mr Allan Owen, manager of the cryptographic evaluations section of the Defence Signals Directorate, to Mr Peter Pavlovic, the managing director of Nexus Solutions Pty Ltd. In that letter Mr Allan Owen says, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will also be aware that before we can undertake to evaluate NTrust&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which is the product&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">you will need a government department to write to us requesting that we evaluate the product and confirming that they wish to purchase the product. This is our normal evaluation sponsorship arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Quite clearly, the Australian small business that came up with this revolutionary solution to the problem that small business confronts
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5654"> on the Internet globally was being given the royal run around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that this is government bungling on behalf of the office of the Defence Signals Directorate. I believe that this is a concerted campaign by the government  through that office to deny all Australian small business the opportunity to benefit from consumer confidence in international commercial transactions over the Net. It is a government acting decisively to do over the small business sector in order to satisfy the spooks here and overseas. It is a government that is acting decisively and patently to put foreign business in front of Australian small business. It is a government that is acting decisively to deny privacy to the country's citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with phone communications, there is an expectation from the general public that they will not be subject to willy-nilly interception and that they are free to conduct their personal affairs without unsolicited and unlawful snoops listening in. There is a legitimate fear in the community of not only misuses of state sponsored surveillance but also privately sponsored surveillance. My view is that individuals have a prima facie right to privacy unless an approved officer orders otherwise to enable a legitimate intercept in the pursuit of a legitimate investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst there can be a legitimate role for surveillance by the state, I do not see the case for every Tom, Dick and Harry with a modem and some knowledge of UNIX to have the ability to listen in and watch the personal interactions of everyone on the Net. I certainly do not see why my e&hyphen;mails or other personal interactions on the Net should be intercepted by every Tom, Dick and Harry. I am pretty sure that most people on the Net do not see why that should be the case for themselves either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the community who do use the Internet would like to avail themselves of secure and reliable encryption products. That is exactly what the government refuses by preventing local business from exporting a 448&hyphen;bit key encryption technology. The office of the Defence Signals Directorate has invited Nexus to downgrade their encryption technol
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ogy to a government approved standard and has suggested that, if they did so, Nexus might have fewer problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the letter that I previously quoted from, the Office of the Defence Signals Directorate suggests that a cryptovariable space of around 40 bits might do the job. Bear in mind that the product offered here by Nexus is 448&hyphen;bit key encryption technology. So clearly the standard that the government would like Australian consumers to accept is an inferior one, and it is a standard that has been cracked. It is a standard that has been shown so far to be deficient by kids on the Net, and that is well understood by consumers on the Net. The position of the government at this stage, through the Office of the Defence Signals Directorate, is one of putting the brakes on Australian small business seeking to exploit the emerging opportunities presented on the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IT industry is one that Labor would like the government to foster. I believe that, in the national and private interest, the government should cease its obstruction of this important encryption tool. If the government wants to ensure that its intelligence organisations can continue to snoop the Net, it must at least make sure that it is done in such a way that local companies that develop products which the government might find acceptable, such as the old unreliable 40&hyphen;bit key technology, are not exposed to unfair foreign interest. Local small business should not be asked by the government to cough up around about a quarter of a million dollars and hand over the source code to their competitors in order to get approval for government purchase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly the conundrum presented in this debate is that, unlike telephone intercepts, the Net provides a framework of communication that does not accept prima facie that people have privacy. Technically that is not possible without the introduction of sophisticated encryption technologies, and that is what presents the difficulties for the spooks who like to rely upon a capacity of having a look at what everyone is doing at any given time.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5655"> That is the very difficult paling that this government is straddling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's traditional ideology purports to represent the rights of the individual. In this debate the government is supporting no privacy for citizens on the Internet at all, and it is supporting the proposition that Australian small business should be disadvantaged and should be slowed down on the Internet rather than exploiting this emerging technology and moving forward with it. I make the point again: Australians are one of the greatest users of technology. We have the fastest take&hyphen;up rate of new technology. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, all right, I am very sorry about that; you all look the same to me. It is fundamental, from what he said, that the government is not doing this, but then nor did the previous government. It was the previous government that brought in legislation to make analog mobile phone calls route back through the exchange so that they could be intercepted. There is this preoccupation that governments and bureaucrats have with being able to control people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am fundamentally opposed to this legislation because there is already too much snooping in Australia. Getting a Federal Court judge to issue a warrant is easy enough. As
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the member for Moore (Mr Filing) said, evidence tendered before a judge, even in chambers, does have to have some credibility, although I am not sure that is always the case. But quite clearly it is easy enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that with the march of technology it is so easy to intercept phone calls now. It is no longer done through the exchange. It can be done by placing apparatus parallel to the lines; it does not even have to touch the lines. There is so much interception done now without any control whatsoever. In many cases, it is simply having the knowledge that provides the powerful weapon to prosecute or to persecute, not necessarily having the right to bring that into the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing is that, despite all this obsession with snooping by the bureaucracy in this country and in other countries, with the advent of the digital telephone, digital communications digital to digital are not interceptible at the present level of technology. I understand it will be some time before it is the case, and anyone wishing to conduct their affairs is almost certainly going to arrange them on that basis. So there is a lot of hyperbole in these proposed amendments by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told we need them for the war on drugs. The truth about the war on drugs is that if governments wanted to stop the incursion of drugs into Australia tomorrow they could do it; it is relatively simple to do. All you have to do is destroy the profit. The reason it is not done is that governments would like this industry to proceed because it gives them something with which to divert attention and something to blame for other problems in the community. The other thing is that there is so much money involved in drugs that there are elements of the bureaucracy that would hate to see this dry up. Drugs are providing the all&hyphen;pervading corruption that exists in Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some talk in Western Australia of the need for a royal commission into the police force. I do not believe this. My electorate covers 92&half; per cent of the state&mdash;in fact, the entire state except for the wasteland around Perth&mdash;and I constantly deal with the police at all levels. I simply do not be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5656"> lieve there is any level of corruption there. I find that there is a lot of dedication. They often do a very difficult job. No-one is perfect&mdash;I can guarantee that there are examples of people in the police force who are less than perfect. When you are looking for corruption you have to look at drug enforcement. If you were to take the corruption out of drug enforcement you would get rid of at least 75 per cent of all corruption&mdash;corruption that pervades not only the police force but also the judiciary and the bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do you do this? Quite simply you take away the profit motive. If we were to say, `You are a heroin addict. The state will provide you with a prescribed amount of heroin at a prescribed strength. You will pay a price that just covers the cost because it is very cheap to make. It will available to you on prescription,' that would cut out the massive crime and the profit motive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We never get the big suppliers. We have recently introduced legislation into this parliament to allow the Federal Police to import heroin. I said at the time that was done that the Federal Police will shortly be rivalling the triads as a source of heroin imports. It was an absolutely outrageously stupid decision. Governments know that if they were to control this business they would wipe it out tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have friends whose children are heroin addicts and I see the agony it causes them. Quite frankly, the best thing to happen to those people is for their kids to die. I know that if my kids were addicts I might not think this way and say these things because I would not be thinking objectively. But, at the end of day, I do not care how many people kill themselves with overdoses of heroin. What I object to is the distortion of society, the distortion of the law and these people robbing chemist shops and involving innocent people. After all, the truth is that far more people die from analgesic overdoses than heroin overdoses every year. Do we care about that? Of course we do not. Why do we not care? Because they are basically middle&hyphen;aged women who die screaming silently. That is the truth of the matter.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If governments were prepared to be sensible about regulating drugs and not creating this industry&mdash;because every time you raise the penalty you raise the margin and we do not get the big people&mdash;you could put a stop to drugs tomorrow. We have seen people made criminals for using marijuana&mdash;something that was legal in Australia prior to 1951 or 1952. It was a constituent of just about every patent medicine. It was made illegal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments of the present persuasion and the other faction that occupies the opposition benches are going the same way with tobacco. I think that in my life I will probably see smoking cigarettes become a gaolable offence. The whole thing is nonsense. It is one area where I think we really should look at a few libertarian principles. If you were to take away this profit motive you would stop the industry tomorrow. You would not need this all pervading invasion of the privacy of the ordinary citizen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One only has to ask: why does this not happen? The government cannot be that stupid. The government must know. It does not happen because they do not want it to happen. They would rather have this war out there which we must fight. That takes our minds off the real problems of this country, such as the lack of jobs. Neither the government nor the opposition has a credible, coherent industry policy. That is the truth of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to return to the situation in Western Australia. You have Mr Les Ayton, the ex&hyphen;deputy commissioner, calling for a royal commission. Mr Ayton was plucked out of the ranks by Commissioner Bull and given a rapid promotion. He held some very senior positions. He was the kingpin of the Western Australian police force for many years. What did he do with all the power and authority he had? Why did he not stamp it out then? If he had done his job we would not need this royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you saw there was an abuse of power. You saw the careers of good officers destroyed on the whims of this man. You saw cases where the magistrate had thrown out the case at a preliminary hearing. To get a magi
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5657"> strate in this judiciary we have in this country to throw out a case at preliminary hearing is almost impossible, but that occurred. What did he do? In league with the Director of Public Prosecutions, the man who said that Ayton was the only policeman he trusted, he got ex officio indictments. There never was a case. It is just as corrupt, in my view, to use the power and force of the law for unnecessary attacks on people as it is to take money in bribes. The cost of intellectual corruption is far more damaging very often than simply taking money. It is more damaging because one can never really come to terms with the motives of the people. I would suggest to you that that has been rife in Western Australia and I suspect throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other technological advances that this bill does not and cannot deal with, for instance illegal bugging and the use of directional microphones. This is all equipment that the Western Australian police force has and I suspect other police forces have as well. I think it is absolutely fundamentally flawed to make it easier for the bureaucracy to snoop on people. Do you really think that people involved in high scale espionage are going to be bothered by this? I bet the proverbial London to a brick that they have already got this equipment from Nexus Solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you think a government embargo on exports is going to stop that? What it is going to do is create a black market where the stuff will get out, almost certainly be copied and we will lose the technological advantage we have, because in industries like this it is  simply being there first that gives you the big advantage. Of course it will get out. After all, we have just seen an invasion of the country by the Fujian triads. They got caught because their boat ran aground. The trouble was that, although the boat was stacked with the very best electronic equipment, it cannot warn you of sand banks if they are not on the maps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us think about it. If that one boat ran aground, how many boats did not? Of course it has been happening for some time and it will probably go on happening because our power to intercept is very, very limited.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government could act to do something about this. We now know that overwhelmingly it is the Chinese triads who are responsible for probably over 70 per cent of the entry of drugs into this country. We know that there are Vietnamese and Cambodian gangs, which were mentioned in the parliament today&mdash;14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old kids on the street. We know that Korean crime gangs came in on visitor and student visas. Yet the government does nothing about this. Nor will these telephone intercepts do anything about adding any real security to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is about the government oppressing the people of Australia even more. I think it is an outrage. I certainly will be supporting the amendments put forward by the opposition, although I do not think they go far enough. I am not going to the trouble of voting against the legislation; I know it will be a futile effort, but I think the opposition's amendments are certainly worth while. Heaven knows, I trust judges in this country little enough and the evidence shows that my judgment is reasonably based. But to give this power to bureaucrats is an absurd nonsense. Does anyone seriously think there will be any real surveillance of this? People who wish to use intercepts will get everything they ask for and it is nonsense to suggest otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be that that is what the bureaucracy wants, but it is not what I want and I am sure that it is not what the great mass of Australian people want.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that of the two principal purposes of the legislation really only one has been dealt with in the debate. There seems to be no concern at all on those parts of the bill designed to strengthen arrangements for dealing with police corruption. The only comments have been addressed to those parts of the bill which seek to introduce new arrangements by which agencies are able to obtain warrants authorising the interception of telecommunications for the investigation of serious criminal offences.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I hear the interjection. I suspect that what the member for Kalgoorlie was talking about was police corruption in general and not those provisions of the bill which are designed to strengthen arrangements for dealing with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to the proposed new arrangements. Settling on the proposed new arrangements was not an easy task. I think the member for Banks would be aware, as others might be, that for my part I am very reluctant to see any change that results in the power to issue warrants being conferred on anybody but judges at the superior court level. The reasoning by which the decision was made in 1979, or whenever it was made, that judges should exercise that power was a right one and it was done for the right reason. But I think the arguments that are being put up to oppose  what is proposed in the bill are, in effect, flying blind. They are not looking at the practical considerations that have arisen since 1979.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might have been beneficial to the opposition if they had sought some briefing on the bill. We certainly were willing to provide any information that might assist. Unfortunately, the opposition did not take up the opportunity of obtaining a briefing. Some of the arguments put up, I think, ignore considerations that have arisen since the decision of the High
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Court in Grollo's case. The citation is 131 ALR 225.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you start with Grollo's case, the member for Banks certainly referred to it, it should not go unnoticed that Justice McHugh, who is not one of the more implied rights minded judges on the High Court, dissented. In his judgment, the provisions in the legislation under consideration which authorised judges of the Federal Court to issue warrants are unconstitutional and invalid.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MELHAM" NAMEID="4T4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4T4">Mr Melham</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other five went the other way, including Gummow. He was hardly a radical.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V5">Mr WILLIAMS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At page 238 in the Australian Law Report report, the judge said that the reason for the invalidity is that `the exercise of administrative power that is involved in authorising the issue of those warrants is incompatible with the exercise of the judicial functions vested in persons who are judges of a Federal Court'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the decision in Grollo, the High Court has decided a couple of other cases in which judicial power has been the focus. One case was Wilson and the minister and another case was Cable v. DPP. The trend is, in High Court reasoning, towards an even greater protection of the integrity of judicial power than was evinced in the judgments of the majority in Grollo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority in Grollo were certainly troubled by the judges exercising the power to issue interception warrants. The reasoning is set out in the joint judgment of Chief Justice Brennan and Justices Deane, Dawson and Toohey and the separate judgment of Justice McHugh. Focus in the argument has been on the separation of the judge as a judge from the function under the legislation and, in legal terms, they are referred to as persona designata.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the High Court said in effect was that the judges could exercise the power. However, they urged caution having regard to the nature of the exercise of judicial power and the involvement of judges in anything that might undermine the perceived independence of the judges when they are exercising judicial power. Judges have consented in the past,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5659"> both from the Federal Court and the Family Court, to exercise the power, and that consent is still current. But the judges of the Federal Court have decided collegiately that they will not exercise that power in the future. I understand that the judges of the Family Court have done the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When neither are willing to exercise the power at the trial level, you are then left with a situation where there is no federal judicial officer able to exercise that power. It means that you have to look for other authorities. What we have done is search high and low to see whether there are other authorities and we have identified senior officers with legal qualifications and experience in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as the only body we are prepared to recommend. I emphasise that we do it reluctantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that, quite apart from the withdrawal of consent, there is another factor that needs to be taken into account. I was advised about a year ago that 17 of the then 44 judges of the Federal Court were respondents to applications in the Federal Court for judicial review of their own decisions to issue interception warrants. That is just wrong. It is calculated to undermine public confidence in the judiciary when the judiciary has to sit in judgment on their own judgments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Practical considerations in this situation are absolutely compelling. Contrary to the expressed views of the member for Kalgoorlie, if we are going to win the war against organised crime, we are going to have to use technological skills, machinery, apparatus and equipment in order to catch criminals. Organised crime is just that: it is organised and it is using all the technology that it can. The level  of technology that is employed by international drug running syndicates is alarming. We have to have the best possible means of countering their activities. Telecommunications interception is one of the few ways where we are able to catch them at work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see anything in the argument put by the opposition that suggests that it is not in support of the use of telecommunications interception or listening devices for the purpose of capturing and charging criminals, at least criminals engaged in serious criminal
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> activity. It therefore becomes a practical question of what safeguards will the public have in the use of warrants for appropriate purposes? The judiciary as the traditional protector is no longer available. We have gone to the next best alternative which is not members of a judiciary but members of a quasi&hyphen;judicial  body accustomed to doing the sorts of things that the High Court regard as important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks read from the joint judgment of the four members dealing with the requirements of a person who is going to exercise the power. It is an intrusive power. It is an important power and it must be exercised with the greatest care, sensitivity and independence. The government believes that the members of the AAT who have the qualifications that are provided for in the bill are the appropriate persons to exercise that power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of consent, the member for Banks has made what I can only treat as a glib suggestion that we appoint additional judges who will have the particular function of exercising powers under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. I do not treat that suggestion seriously. There is a need for judges in a variety of places. They must be available a lot of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the requirements under the act is for an intensive system of reporting. I get delivered to me on a quarterly basis records of all warrants that have been issued, by whom they have been issued, in respect of what and for what period. The records are available to me, if required. I do review those reports. One thing that is plain is that the judges who have exercised the power in the past are in a variety of places, and there is a number of judges at any given time who are exercising the power. There is a need for availability that necessitates having people not only available in the capital cities but available to be dealt with from wherever there is a need for the warrant to be issued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having a large number of judges, like the 30-odd of the Federal Court who in the past have consented to act, and Family Court judges, is beneficial. We need a similar
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5660"> number in the event that the judges are not to be available. Again, the members of the AAT would be appropriate from that point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the point of view of the court, the problem is a significant one also in the time that each of them must spend. In order to issue a warrant, a judge does not simply look at a piece of paper, read a very short affidavit, and then act on it. In a normal situation the judge will receive an application and will hear the applicant or someone on whose behalf the application is being made. I am advised that each application on average can take between one and two hours. That is a significant time commitment for judges who are appointed to exercise judicial functions rather than the executive function that this is. On that basis, I think we ought also to have regard to the desirability of finding another source.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that no speaker, except the member for Kalgoorlie, has suggested an alternative source of the exercise of the power. The member for Kalgoorlie has suggested employing members of the private sector, by which I assume he means private lawyers. That I do not think would be publicly acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public must have the greatest level of confidence that this power will be exercised impartially and for bona fide purposes. On that basis, the person to exercise the power must be publicly visible. I do not think that members of the private legal profession, however much respect might be accorded them individually, would be seen in that category; they would not be members of an identifiable class, the legal profession itself being far too large to be identifiable.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">As I said in my speech on the second reading debate, my amendments are aimed at amending the bill before us, which at the moment allows an extension to the interception act that will permit the minister to nominate  specified members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue interception warrants for law enforcement purposes. The bill also contains corresponding amendments to the AFP Act and the Customs Act, which will authorise nominated AAT members to issue listening device warrants to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my speech on the second reading debate, the opposition believes that this is not the way to go. I understand the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) when he says that he is reluctant to see this change. It is the opposition's view that, if this change goes forward and proceeds, it will be a weakening of what is a very intrusive process, which at the moment does have the confidence of the community because it is judicial officers who are exercising those powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government made a number of amendments to the act as a result of earlier cases. It is significant that in Grollo it was a five to one majority. There was a joint judgment, a very powerful joint judgment, of four judges of the court. The court in that judgment&mdash;and I quoted from the unreported version, pages 17 through to 19&mdash;gave the history of why it was that it was judges who use these powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that some Federal Court judges might not want to exercise these powers. But the fact is that the High Court has said they can, and it is legal under the act at the moment. It is not a flippant suggestion, if there is a problem with the resources&mdash;and there is no doubt that the judges are being asked to do more and more with less resources&mdash;to say `appoint more judges'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could then have extra judges spreading the workload throughout the Federal Court and have specialised judges who have consented throughout the Commonwealth designated to do this particular work. So you will not have a situation where you find that 17 out of 44 judges are the subject of proceedings. There should be a moderate expansion of the court to allow this important role to be continued by Federal Court judges. To allow the AAT to now do this, in the opposition's view, is to bring the system into disrepute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arguments have all been put. It is disappointing, but it is important to point out that on the government side only the Attorney-General has participated in the debate. He opened the debate and he closed the debate. Not one other government member has risen in this chamber to support what is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5662"> a fundamental change to current principles, and that is disturbing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the amendments to the House. The opposition will be calling for a division on them. We believe that the government has not made out the case. We believe that a proper reading of the Grollo case would lend the government to conclude that they really should be providing further resources rather than having this alternative of weakening what is a current protection in the act for all of us.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When is Mr Howard going to do something to create jobs? For that matter, when has Mr Howard ever been successful at creating even one job? Has Mr Howard ever been in business? Has Mr Howard ever actually employed someone himself and been responsible for producing the income to keep that person employed, or is Mr Howard just a career politician with no real or recent experience of Australia outside politics?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Western Australian Trades and Labour Council and its leader Tony Cooke are gearing up for another round of industrial strife in WA under the guise of acting on behalf of its union members. Tony Cooke, how about representing all of your union members&mdash;not just your powerful mates, but the small individuals that have called your office often in the last few weeks for help and you have not even bothered to return their calls?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The specific case to which I refer is as follows. Two school teachers, Cheryl Soggee and Colleen Reed, were unfairly dismissed from Culunga school last year. These teachers were members of the Independent Schools  Salaried Officers Association, ISSOA. On the request of and on behalf of these teachers, the ISSOA lodged an appeal of unfair dismissal
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the WA Industrial Relations Commission, the WAIRC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was done without informing the teachers that they could lodge an appeal under their own names. Culunga school held a reconciliation conference with the WAIRC without the teachers knowledge or presence. Subsequently, the two teachers were informed of the meeting and were told that they should accept the decisions arrived at in their absence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two aggrieved teachers elected not to accept the proposed arrangements and preferred to take the matter to trial. At a later meeting with Ivan Sands, Theresa Howe of the association&hyphen;cum&hyphen;union and Cheryl Soggee, the union said they would not proceed to trial because they did not believe the case was winnable. The union also stated that, if they lost, Cheryl would be unemployable. In other words, they were using scare tactics on her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cheryl elected to take her chance. Ivan Sands of the union said, `The ISSOA doesn't fight on principles. We will not take the matter to trial. Therefore, take it or leave it.' Cheryl Soggee informed the ISSOA that she would engage a private lawyer at her own expense, to which they replied, `Do what you want.' Mark Diamond, a private lawyer, was given the case of their unfair dismissal appeal and this was subsequently won before the WAIRC on behalf of Cheryl and Colleen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cheryl and Colleen are now waiting to appeal&mdash;not the decision but the amount of compensation awarded, which was only eight weeks. Ivan Sands, on behalf of the ISSOA has now refused their request to sign a form 7 which again will see this matter handed to the private legal representation that is being retained by Cheryl and Colleen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ivan Sands has also refused to return the phone calls of these teachers. Eventually when he returned their calls, he stated his intention not to cooperate with the teachers. He also knew that, by taking so much time, the 21&hyphen;day appeal period had virtually expired. He refused to put his decision in writing and said he was going home early. But when they rang some time later, he was still there. He had not gone home at all.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5665">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tony Cooke, the so-called representative of the Western Australian Trades and Labour Council, has also refused to return numerous phone calls from these teachers asking for help. This sad case begs a few questions of this unrepresentative union, the ISSOA. Does the ISSOA only represent people whose cases in its opinion it can win? Does it not represent members with difficult cases?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is the case, I send a general warning to all ISSOA members that their union is unrepresentative and not worth belonging to. Other ISSOA members must ask themselves why they pay union fees like Colleen and Cheryl when the union chooses not to represent them or even let some private systems be used. The ISSOA dishonestly claimed credit in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 30 April for Cheryl and Colleen's win in the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do Ivan Sands and the ISSOA and Tony Cooke and the TCL only represent their noisy union mates, like those from the so-called tent embassy, at the expense of ignoring the other battling and fee paying members like Colleen and Cheryl or is it up to coalition members like me who have to help the little people because their unions will not? I think it is a disgusting situation that these people are not being represented by their union. They need their help to get this appeal through the Industrial Relations Commission of Western Australia, and they have been blocked by the people who purport to represent them.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5665"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

I remember once, I must have been 8 or 9, and I was locked in the old morgue. The adults who worked there would tell us of the things that happened in there, so you can imagine what I went through.

I've seen my sister dragged by the hair into those block rooms and belted because she's trying to protect me . . . How could this be for my own good? Please tell me.</PARA>

Once we were there, we had the Welfare coming in, asking you what you was going to do&mdash;telling you most of the time that your parents didn't want you, the father of the baby didn't want you . . . they said to me they couldn't find anyone that wanted me, and they couldn't find anywhere for me, like a live&hyphen;in job where I could take the baby. And then they said the only one they could find that was willing to take me was my eldest sister, who I'd never seen since I was a little girl&mdash;she'd gone before us: she went away with some white people that were supposed to take her away for a good education&mdash;and they said she was the only one who was willing to take me, but she didn't want the baby.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we have a large number of primary school children, who are from my electorate of Corangamite, from the schools of Meredith, Lethbridge, Batesford and Shelford, and Anakie in the seat of Corio. They have made the trip to Canberra to see the federal parliament in action, to witness first-hand the deliberations of the elected representatives of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently I visited a group of students at the Meredith school to talk about the parliament, Australia's democracy and the system of government. We conducted a mock parliament and the two sides debated a very important issue. We learned about the procedure of the parliament at the school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday the students came here to the parliament to see the parliament in action. Mr Speaker, they saw you in action in your role as the Speaker of this parliament, trying to keep order in the parliament and maintain a sense of decorum, keeping the stridently held views of both sides and keeping a sense of balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, they saw the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) given a one-hour suspension because he was not behaving as well as he might have done. The member for Corio once worked for Senator Button and championed lower tariffs and free trade, but he has now become a champion of no tariff cuts. What a change he has undertaken! So the member for Corio was given a little suspension just at the half&hyphen;time break, which is his usual style. He had a friend with him as well, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He also had a suspension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend you, Mr Speaker, for your impartial deliberation on that occasion and again today. I am sorry my students were not here to see you in action again in the impar tial way in which you deliberate here in the parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in Meredith we had a mock parliament, and the Speaker on that occasion was myself, as the member for Corangamite. I had similar difficulties with the students because they showed similar tendencies as members in this parliament in expressing their views, putting them forward strongly. They showed a couple of points of order and had to be pulled into line by the acting speaker on that occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As they saw here earlier in the evening, this parliament is an expression of views throughout the nation and the philosophic differences that people on both sides express and put in a very strong and robust manner. As I often say to the students around my electorate, that is very much better than the armed conflict which takes place in other nations around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At election time, Australians have a chance to put their point of view in their electorates through the ballot box. At the Meredith school we conducted a ballot so that the students could fully understand the significance of a secret ballot. I must say I am personally supportive of the compulsory voting procedures that Australians have undertaken because it means that everyone participates in the democracy, unlike the situation in American where President Clinton was elected by a little over 25 per cent of the electorate .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in Meredith, Lethbridge, Bannockburn and the other areas represented by the schools here tonight from the electorate of Corangamite, conditions have been very tough. Seasonal conditions have been poor and the local beef producers are suffering poor cattle prices because of the high grain prices in America. Wool growers are recovering, and the wool price has now reached 700c as sheep numbers recover. Hopefully, that industry will be better off in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the hardship experienced by those two industries in my electorate, the farmers have been working hard under the landcare arrangements to contain the serrated tussock, a noxious weed which could have a devastating impact in the Corio electorate. I concede that the member for Corio has some serrated tussock in some parts of his electorate. That
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5667"> is a weed that needs to be removed&mdash;maybe like the member for Corio at some future date. Also in the electorate of Corangamite, in the Meredith area, we have a tree planting program. Trees are being planted by farmers and by people in other industries to deal with the problems of salinity and soil degradation. I commend those farmers who have embarked on this new tree planting program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I hope that the students from the Meredith school have enjoyed their trip to Canberra and have enjoyed seeing the parliament in action in all its competitive arrangements. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

This is a report about `William'. It is confidential evidence 553. William said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can remember this utility with a coffin on top with flowers. As a little boy I saw it get driven away knowing there was something inside that coffin that belonged to me. I think I was about six years old at the time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was William's mother. He speaks of being taken away from his auntie and uncle. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a little kid I can't remember what was going on really, because I was a child and I thought I was going on a trip with the other brothers. I just had excitement for going on a trip. That's all I can think of at the time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He speaks of being taken to St Francis orphanage and then being taken to the home of  a woman known as `Mrs R.' He says that the welfare officer led him and his brother into
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Mrs R's home. Mrs R, with the welfare officer, showed them a large and well&hyphen;furnished room. However, he gives the account that after the welfare officer left they were taken outside to a caravan and that became their home. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was sleeping in the caravan. I was only a little boy then. In the middle of the night somebody came to the caravan and raped me. That person raped me and raped me. I could feel the pain going through me. I cried and cried and they stuffed my head in the pillow. And I had nobody to talk to. It wasn't the only night it happened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oh God, it seemed like night after night. It seemed like nobody cared. I don't know how long it went on for, but night after night I'd see the bogey man. I never saw the person. I do not know who that person was.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then William gives evidence of being taken away from that family. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They shifted us again and that was into town again. And then they put us in with this bloke . . . They've got the records of what he did to me. That man abused me. He made us do dirty things that we never wanted to do. Where was the counselling? Were was the help I needed? They knew about it. The guy went to court. He went to court but they did nothing for me, nothing. They sent us off to the Child Psychology Unit. I remember the child psychologist saying, `He's an Aboriginal kid, he'll never improve.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">William gives an account of some behavioural problems that he has, the effect of alcohol and marijuana abuse and the problems he now has communicating with his children. The story is of itself obviously very moving, and there are a number of other moving stories in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accepted analysis is that it is now the case that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) can certainly give an apology on behalf of the nation in this House. Indeed, he could give an apology outside this House, appropriately worded, without it being an admission for the purpose of legal proceedings and damages. I think that in light of these facts that have been given to the government of the day it is a matter of honour. It is incumbent on the </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5668">
<PARA STYLE="Para">government to apologise and express the profound regret of the nation for what has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, the government has two choices: it can deal with the issue of compensation administratively or it can let the process take place in the courts. There is no doubt&mdash;in my view&mdash;that this report constitutes a material fact which will overcome any time limitation problems that otherwise may have existed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, litigants would have within 12 months of the handing down of this report or becoming aware of its contents to commence proceedings. If proceedings are commenced, as they most certainly will be, without administrative compensation, there is every prospect that damages will far outweigh any administrative remedy. Those damages will go to the select few who have the resources to commence proceedings. In addition to the higher damages burden that the government will suffer in those proceedings, the government will, of course, suffer an additional burden of legal fees, which will be at least 20 per cent of the cost. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we have indicated in other forums, the opposition is comfortable in supporting the progress of the Wool International Amendment Bill 1997 through the parliament. The bill provides for Wool International to dispose of the wool stockpile in the manner which has been envisaged for some years now with the restructure which began under the former government and which is being carried on at the moment. Because of the improved fortunes of the wool market and the management of the stockpile in the past few years, there is even a bit of a bonus over what was anticipated there, because there will apparently be a dividend and we will be seeing the retirement of the debt. The target date remains at December 1998 and we anticipate that Wool International will be wound up in 2001.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The time is now here for us, as politicians and members of parliament who have had a longstanding involvement for many decades in the management of the marketing of the wool industry, to begin asking questions about the future role of government across a whole range of agricultural marketing areas where we have seen so much restructuring in the past 15 years, with many industries now taking complete responsibility for the marketing of their products. In many ways, the government's role is reduced to passing legislation that enforces levies that provide for payments for research and development efforts and for marketing efforts in some areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure that I am entirely comfortable with this as a longstanding direction, you might be pleased to hear me say, Mr Deputy Speaker. Right across the Australian economy, I see various industries taking responsibility for these efforts, yet I cannot help but conclude that Australia's research and development effort is still abysmally low by world standards. Our scientific effort, in many ways, is lower than it should be. Of course, I could make the obvious political points that one could make in a forum like this, that the current government's cuts to the budget in these areas send all the wrong signals to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the interesting paradox in all this is that&mdash;totally because of government involvement in the management of these industries&mdash;there is, in agriculture in particular, and emerging in fisheries as well, a very strong commitment to the use of science and research to better advance the product, in order to keep ahead of the trends that we are continually having to battle against in world markets. Maybe that is because this industry has been exposed to the international market for longer than many other industries in Australia have been, or maybe it is because government has had a significant role in the management of industry. They may be the reasons. I do not necessarily say that that has been wrong, but there are some areas of it that we are withdrawing from completely, with a question mark over whether we really ought to be doing so.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5670">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am signalling here&mdash;and it is a luxury that we in opposition have at the moment&mdash;is that at our level there is a blank page rethink going on about what is the next step forward. What is the most appropriate structure for the wool industry, or any other industry, particularly one that is bulking up into a large commodity? Is it a single desk structure? At least two industries, the wheat industry and the sugar industry, place great store by that&mdash;the sugar industry moving towards it, and the wheat industry protecting it. In many ways, what we now know as Wool International&mdash;certainly for the export effort&mdash;has been a single desk marketing system. Is that the way to go? Other industries in agriculture that are moving into export development are asking themselves these very questions and we are seeing quite significant arguments among the players about whether they want to be part of a bulked&hyphen;up, single desk type structure, or whether they want to go it alone and have their own marketing strategies for their own particular products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Australia's international interests&mdash;and, therefore, our national interest&mdash;I think that government has a responsibility to take an overriding role in quality assurance. To perform successfully as an exporting nation Australia must regard quality assurance as being of great significance. I am not just talking about the quality of the product itself, but the quality of the whole performance of the delivery of the Australian product: the way it is produced, marketed, and transported&mdash;everything to do with the way we present ourselves in international trade. Whether it is the clearing house model, or whether it is remaining with single desk structures where government must have some kind of supervisory role in the way we present ourselves internationally, or whether we start encouraging some of these bulked&hyphen;up industries, such as wool and wheat, to look at some sort of cooperative structure with the breaking down of the bulk into particular target areas, remains to be seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of weeks ago I addressed the Wool Council of Australia's annual meeting at Geelong&mdash;and I thank the Wool Council for having so quickly made an opportunity for me to have my first dialogue with the industry, having recently moved into this portfolio. I was quite fascinated by the address given to that forum by Mr Henry Grunzke, who is president of the International Wool Textile Organisation, and I could not help thinking that what Henry was saying was actually quite consistent with these little reservations or question marks that I have over my own thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was, in effect, saying that, albeit the wool price is improving slightly at the moment, it is off the back of some particular trends in marketing cycles, including the running down of stockpiles in some of the purchasing nations. But his overall message was that it is going to get tougher. The competition from other commodities and other textile fabrics is going to get tougher, not easier. It is not as if the world is suddenly moving back to some great re&hyphen;enchantment with wool. Wool itself is going to have to find yet more ways of making itself an easier product to deal with for the world, and a better product for the world to deal with. That means blends with other textiles or synthetics. A very interesting case being talked about widely is the experiment with cotton to produce a new denim fabric. This may hold real opportunities for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, in the middle of all that presentation, I think Henry Grunzke was really saying that if Australia wants to just produce a bulk commodity and get a bulk commodity price, there is not much real long&hyphen;term joy in that for wool growers. I listened to the debate at the Wool Council about, for instance, preparing wool in environmentally acceptable bales that can be both recycled and re&hyphen;used, and can guarantee the cleanliness of the fibre product in those bales.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5671"> They are more expensive than existing bales. With a recycling life, they would probably work out to be more efficient and more economic for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several delegates from the floor immediately asked the question: who is to bear this cost? Is the cost to be borne by the producer who sticks it in the bale or is it going to be in the price that they receive for their end product? The message Mr Grunzke was giving was: `I do not think you can expect the purchaser to pay for it.' That immediately created a response amongst the delegates: `How can you expect the producer to pay for it, when his returns are so low now?' And I thought, `This has got a sense of inevitability about it. If he does not present his product in a bale the way the world wants it, they will just buy it somewhere else.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inevitably, that kind of improved presentation of the product is going to be a cost borne by the producer or by the industry in Australia, if it wants to stay viable, if others are producing or supplying their product in that form. What Mr Grunzke was really saying was that there are two ways to go about this. One of the suggestions was that maybe we are too bulked up; maybe in having all the export effort going into the stockpile, and with all the difficulties of then trying to break it down into particular areas, we are losing a value&hyphen;add margin. Yet at the same time he was saying that, internationally, it is impossible to deal with a few producers, a few growers, who might produce a few hundred or a few thousand bales of a particular fabric or a particular fibre content. He was really saying that they are looking to deal with blocks that can produce year&hyphen;round supply, but maybe of 100,000, 200,000 or 300,000 bales&mdash;in other words, some kind of cooperative structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my thinking I have a question mark&mdash;as I am signalling&mdash;over whether the move to the total free market, hoping that our agricultural producers can get in touch with their end customer much better and hoping that they will get it right, is too much of a risk for Australia. But I am well aware that leaving international marketing bulked up into large single desks that are not responsive, or not responsive enough, to the changes taking place in both the content of material and the blending of synthetics, leaves us exposed to bulk prices at the bottom end. That is not consistent with the value adding theme that this nation has to work with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, and in every forum I speak in, I will continue to place myself directly in opposition to the comments of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, who earlier this year said that he saw Australia's future being in improving our performance in the production and supply of export raw materials. He made the comment that he did not see much future in value adding for this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw a comment from the deputy president of Canegrowers in Queensland yesterday that government is now turning the bush into ghost towns. Every instinct I have, every lesson I have learned in my time in this parliament, tells me that the decline in our country towns and country regions, this whole concern nationally about this drift away from country towns, can only be reversed with two trends. One is government reinvesting in the people and community services that government has been pulling out of these towns in recent years. But that will only happen on the back of private sector investment in these areas as well, in what I choose to call value adding as close as possible to the source of production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the brief time available to me, I will tell a tale that sums this up. In the last couple of years, a wool tops plant has been built in Melton, in my electorate. Mr Kim from Korea has invested in this fabulous new plant. It has created about 40 or 50 new jobs, which is terrific for my electorate. I had a serious discussion with Mr Kim about why he chose this area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5672">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Melton is on the western outskirts of Melbourne, about 40 kilometres from the CBD, right near the new infrastructure that we invested in, such as the standard gauge rail, the waterfront, the airport&mdash;the whole box and dice. There was  competition from many areas, as everyone wanted Mr Kim to invest in their area. I asked him why he chose Melton. He gave a number of reasons. He said that it was not far from the product, because the wool stores are all around the west of Melbourne. A very well&hyphen;trained and reliable work force was available. A university campus was right next door, and he wanted that for his children. A golf course was also nearby, so that made it a very attractive work environment for him&mdash;a hell of a lot better than he could get in Seoul in Korea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the telling point was that he said that, if he had come and looked himself seven years earlier&mdash;that would have been in about 1986 or 1987&mdash;he would have invested then. I asked, `Why didn't you?' He said that it was because the Australian Wool Board, as it was then called, told him not to invest here. It told him that the difficulties of doing business in Australia were a discouragement. It quoted the waterfront, the labour market&mdash;the usual stuff the conservatives traipse out&mdash;and it urged him to make his investment in Seoul and to continue to import bales of wool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now he has had a look for himself instead of relying on that advice, and he has done it. He is rapt in the performance, and so am I. But what are we doing to ourselves by giving that sort of message? The very people who ought to be reversing the drift away from regional Australia are actually saying, `Don't invest here.' That may have been an isolated case. Let us hope it was a very isolated case. Let us hope the image has changed in the last decade. Certainly, I have put an enormous amount of effort into that region around the west and north of Melbourne to try to change that image for exactly that reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament must focus on how to reverse this drift. What is the future role of government in this area? Is it fostering a clearing house model, or fostering large single desks, or fostering cooperative models, where the producer can be bulked up enough to meet the task? I am very impressed with what I have seen, for instance, at the Bega Cheese Cooperative. It has managed to survive as a cooperative structure of 100 or so dairy producers in a highly competitive market against multinational organisations which are competing in that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe there is something in that. As we successfully make the transition from the old Wool Board and the old stockpile through to Wool International and the process where growers are now taking total responsibility and government is moving out from under them, this is the time to think about what the role of government should be in ensuring that we get the maximum value added, particularly out of these industries which have become used to marketing in large volumes to export markets that are getting tougher and tougher, with finer and finer margins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to comment about something that happened yesterday, which I could not help chuckling about. Yesterday in question time I asked the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer), a question. I like Mr Fischer. I have always found him to be a lovely chap and a fellow I enjoy working with. So it quite surprised me when he got up and started off his answer by saying to me that he thought I was having a very difficult time as the new shadow minister for primary industries, and that this had been `demonstrated by his pathetic performance at Geelong at the Wool Council meeting.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all say these things in politics, I suppose, but I thought, `Gee, Tim, that is a bit out of character for you. You don't normally, certainly not towards me anyway, start off in that frame of mind.' I thought I would place on the record&mdash;just to help the Deputy Prime Minister in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5673"> his assessment&mdash;a lovely letter that I received yesterday from the Wool Council. It virtually arrived in my office as the Deputy Prime Minister was making his comments. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of all the members and the staff, I wish to thank you for your excellent address at our recent conference.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They go on to talk about the way we might have a strong link between the council, the opposition and ourselves, which is a very sensible strategy for the Wool Council to be maintaining. I understand that fully. I hope that Tim will be a little more gentle with me in his comments in future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, we are very comfortable with this particular piece of legislation and the process which it is unfolding. I have used this opportunity this morning to signal that, certainly in our position in opposition, our role at the moment is not just that of opposing the government. We also see ourselves as a future government. We see ourselves as having to come forward with ideas for the future. I am also signalling this question of the importance of agriculture as a key industry in the Australian economy. It is not an industry that you can go out and say, `Agriculture is special and Australia has got to have answers for agriculture because it is special.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly within my party, and within our people, whatever case we make for Australia's need to have a steel industry in the future, whatever case we make about the textile industry or the car industry, it is equally so that this whole issue of rural and regional social infrastructure, and the running down of our country towns, is totally dependent on a strong national investment in agriculture and value adding as close as possible to a source of production. I think the key questions that we will be focusing on in the next 12 months or so, as we prepare what will go to the Australian people in this policy area, will be the extent to which government has not done enough, or has to do more, or has begun opting out, rightly or wrongly. I thank the House for the chance to make those few observations and signal that we will be supporting this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr CAMPBELL</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Kalgoorlie)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.09 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1970, I was one of those people advocating the establishment of the Wool Corporation, a single desk seller, for which I have said a thousand mea culpas. However, while the price was set, somewhat below the cost of production, it probably did not do a lot of harm. It was not until the Wool Corporation decided it would become a price setter under David Asimus that the real damage was made visible. There is no doubt in my mind that David Asimus has done enough damage to be given the Order of Australia, like Andrew Peacock.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not a committed free marketeer or a committed single desk seller; I think it depends very much on the commodity. But in respect of wool, the only future for wool growers must lie in a free market. It must lie in a close liaison between wool producers and wool end users&mdash;not in making them the enemy, as the wool industry has tried to do in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad that this bill, the Wool International Amendment Bill 1997, provides for the dissolution of Wool International. It was a hangover from the old Wool Corporation and it is something that should be swept away. Any growers, in my view, who reinvest their money in any entity associated with Wool International deserve what they get. I would urge every one of them to use their market to repatriate debt or to some other useful purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has got to be realised that, as we produce it in Australia, greasy wool is an agricultural commodity and agricultural commodities throughout the world are subject to downward pressure in price. What we need to do is to value add. Top making is an industrial product&mdash;it
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5674"> is an industrial fibre. If all our wool was sold as top making in Australia, wool would be Australia's number one export again. Its size belies its importance and it would be far more important because it would employ a lot of people, and it would employ people in country towns. It would employ far more people, for instance, than the mining industry does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I believe our growers should be looking to go beyond top making, at least to the spinning stage. I see no reason why we cannot be competitive in Australia with a single white yarn. If it is so that we are not competitive there&mdash;and bear in mind that, up to the spinning stage, wool is capital intensive, not labour intensive&mdash;I suggest our growers should look to liaisons with countries that can provide a cheaper source of spinning but retain ownership of that product. I would suggest that India, which has invested heavily in wool technology, might be a place to look. Certainly I think that having an association of growers keeping control of their product to the yarn stage, where they sell directly to knitters and worsted makers, would give a far greater return to growers than it does today. It would also give more stability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was very little variation or drop in the price of wool yarn. We saw the price of greasy wool go below the cost of production. In fact, even top making was sold below the cost of production. But it was not so with yarn. I believe it would give a lot more security to our growers and it would also provide them with a great increase in their income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of hype about quality control and it is used, in my view, as one way of blaming the victim. It can tell growers that the drop in prices is partly their own problem. I believe it is nonsense. As a regular visitor to China, I have visited Chinese wool mills on many occasions. The Chinese repeatedly told me that they have no problem with the quality of Australian wool. They do, however, have big problems with the quality of wool from elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to a comment that was made by the previous speaker, that wool is facing enormous competition from other fibres. Yes, there is competition from other fibres, but the wool we sell today, the fine merino wool, accounts for about five per cent of the fibre market. The main competition for our wool is other wool; it is not synthetic fibres. While I am all in favour of looking at value adding&mdash;at blends and all those innovations&mdash;it must be remembered that the main competition for our wool is other wool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can remember that, when I was in the Labor Party, it took me 12 months to get to the caucus a resolution to ban the export of Australian genetic material. It took me three attempts. At last, I succeeded. The next week, the minister, then Collins, marched back into the caucus room and overturned that without any discussion with caucus. The truth was that most people in the caucus did not understand the industry, and certainly Collins never understood the industry. But that was overturned. It appears that people such as the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) had his ear. The member for Corangamite represents that raft of small studs across Australia that see some quick money to be made in selling off our genetic heritage&mdash;150 years of our endeavour&mdash;for the quick quid overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that in my endeavours to have a ban on the export of Australian genetic material I had the wholehearted support of the big studs and the overwhelming support of Australian farmers. I even went to New Zealand to canvass New Zealand growers and I assured them that, in spite of the closer economic arrangements, if they did not agree to put a ban on the sale of genetic material then we would ban them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wool industry in New Zealand said to me, `Look, we only export it because you do. We would stop tomorrow.' I spoke to one of the biggest exporters and he said, `I would love
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5675"> to stop because I know the damage it is doing. I only do it because you are doing it in Australia.' I think there is a greater understanding of the problem in New Zealand where they do have a small but very good fine merino wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it was not to be. I believe that any government that genuinely has an interest in the Australian wool industry should move quickly to put a total ban on the export of Australian genetic material, and that is about the only area where I want to see any government involvement in the wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area that we need to look at is on-farm wool production. One of the main sources of contamination in wool comes from the exhaustive testing we do which tends to punch polypropylene fibres into the wool where they become mixed, and because the fibres do not take dye they show up in the final product. There are things we could do here. We could certainly look at producing a binding twine that takes dye for baled hay, which is one of the other big sources of pollution, and I am sure that we could do something about making a wool pack that would accept dye, or better still, doing away with wool packs in the shearing shed altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A company called Australian Topmaking Services was set up in Parkes as a custom top maker but the company is now under the control of Elders so I do not know what direction it will take. That top making plant has become the best in the world. It has leapfrogged the French in terms of productivity and it produces a top quality product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of that company in Parkes was the brainchild of John Todhunter, a man who was enormously abused by the wool industry in Australia and by the vested interests in the wool industry. He was one of the great lateral thinkers of the wool industry and he made an enormous contribution. He also designed an on&hyphen;farm bulk baler which was very similar to those used in the cotton industry where the whole clip was put into large containers, pressed with a very simple pressing mechanism and then taken directly to the top maker, thereby doing away with the cost of baling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was very beneficial. When I finished wool classing, the instructor said to us as we got our certificates, `Every one of you will now go out and overclass the clip,' which every one of us did, `but unless you can increase your market share in the United States, the biggest fibre users in the world, there won't be a wool industry in 25 years.' That was 35 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was some substance to what he said. The Wool Corporation spent $2 billion in the United States trying to increase the percentage of wool used in the United States, but with absolutely negligible success. The reason was that while $2 billion is an enormous amount of money to Australian wool producers, it is an infinitesimal amount of money when you spread it across American television. It simply did not go anywhere. The idea should have been to target certain areas and grow an interest in wool out from the areas that were most suitable for its application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to contrast the approach of the Australian wool industry in this respect with that of one of the big Italian mills. That mill sent Mr Todhunter to America with a month's pay and said, `After that you are on your own.' He established that firm in the United States and it is now one of the big consumers, and he did it without $2 billion of Australian taxpayers' money. I think it was a great mistake to spend those billions. It was a great cost to the Australian taxpayer. We still have to attract that market, and I believe we can because of the unique qualities of our wool. I look forward to an increase in that market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5676">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should also not overlook the importance of Europe for, while China is our biggest single consumer, it is Europe that still sets the style and the standard and so we must maintain our close contact with the wool industry in Europe. It is true that the centre of gravity has probably moved from Bradford to somewhere around northern Italy, France and Germany, but it is Europe still where style is set and it is an area where we must have constant communication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are people in Australia who need some credit for the work they have done. Jim Maple&hyphen;Brown is without peer. He has played an enormous part in trying to put some sense into the Australian wool industry. I believe that, if anyone deserves an Order of Australia, it should be Jim Maple&hyphen;Brown. I believe that the work that Mr Maple&hyphen;Brown is doing will continue to show great benefits for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned Jonathan Todhunter. Other growers, Jim and Susie Clarke from Hamilton, in Victoria, recently had their shed burnt down. At the height of the depression in wool, they have built a shed especially designed with an approach to reduce the handling in the woolshed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that, when you are making tops, a top maker can disguise the quality of the wool enormously. One of the problems we have had in some part is unscrupulous top makers that have put a lot of very short fibre into their product. They can twist it up in the middle of the yarn and it will not show until it is knitted up, and it comes out as little balls on woollen clothes. Quality tops are an art as much as a science. I believe that, if we concentrate on quality, we can have an ongoing substantial market in the sale of tops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, if you are producing tops, freight becomes a much less significant factor. You are not transporting grease or dirt. You are transporting a commodity that will stand airfreight and, for those mills that are operating on a basis of keeping their stockpile down, it is a very good method of getting their fibre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You also have to look at other options. The CSIRO in Australia developed a technique for treating wool so that they could give a 1,000&hyphen;year guarantee on its freedom from rot and insect infestation. It then made an ideal product for insulation. I believe that there is a market worldwide for woollen insulation, but it is not for Australian wool. We are not selling wool. Wool is a generic commodity. We are selling merino and we should never lose sight of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If China were to put a lot of the rough wool it produces into the insulation market, this would make a bigger gap in the Chinese market so that they could consume our wool. They are big wool producers. They only want our wool to make their wool saleable. As soon as they have self&hyphen;sufficiency in that area&mdash;a self&hyphen;sufficiency which I do not think they will get&mdash;they will simply stop buying our wool. No&hyphen;one buys from us because they like us. They buy from us because we have what they want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that we should be encouraging that technique, even if we buy that cheap wool out of China, which we would get for cash very cheaply. We could process it and sell wool batts. There is not a government in the world today who would put fibreglass wool insulation into its buildings, for fear of later legal ramifications. For an example, Electricite de France in Europe very successfully stopped the development of nuclear energy in Germany by funding the Greens. There was no doubt that this happened. This was admitted to me over a couple of bottles of red wine in France. They were very pleased with their efforts and so they should have been. The Greens were not an entity in France and Electricite de France is now the world's premier producer of nuclear powered electricity, which, of course, puts them in very good stead with all this hocus&hyphen;pocus nonsense about the greenhouse gases that we have allowed ourselves to be subjected to.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5677">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just add in passing that that is an idea that has no basis in science whatsoever, an idea that has been promulgated by scientists looking, in many cases, just to get loan grants. There is no evidence at all to suggest there is any correlation between greenhouse gases from industry and world warming. In fact, it is an arrogance of man: if you test ice squalls in the Antarctic you will find levels of CO2 far exceeding anything that we have made with our puny efforts. I might add that volcanic activity and the burning of forests also make the products of industry look pretty puny. Nonetheless, by their advocacy and use of nuclear energy, they have put themselves in a much better position than we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe there is a great future for wool. I believe that future will be with wool growers, either individually or in combination, supplying the product direct to the industry to the specifications required by the industry. This may, in fact, require that shearing happens at shorter intervals than 12 months. It may be that the desired length of fibre can be obtained in 10 months. If that is the case, that is what will have to happen. But I believe the future of the industry lies much more in direct and close liaison between wool growers and end users to supply what the customer needs. I do not think wool growers need to be intimidated by a lot of the nonsense that is spoken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say again that I am glad to see the opportunity to sweep away Wool International and I believe that the free market in wool is one area where the free market can be seen to work. That is not the case in every area, and I certainly reserve my judgment in respect to grain, because I do not believe the market is free in grain anyway; it is cartelled. But, in the area of wool, I think we are going in the right direction here. I must say that, following a speech by the now minister at Dubbo, I thought that we would not see this, but it is in the bill that growers can take all their money out. As I say, if they leave any money in any grower organisation involved in world marketing, then they deserve what they get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that, when the Garnaut report came out&mdash;and the Garnaut report was a very flawed document&mdash;I went to Dubbo at the behest of the Labor Party, basically because they had no&hyphen;one else to go. I made a speech to the assembled crowd at Dubbo and said to them that I thought it was a flawed document. After all, this man Garnaut was the one who gave us <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and the Northeast Asian ascendancy</EMPHASIS>, a book which has attracted the minds of both Liberal and Labor Party members, and a book so important that I thought I must read it. It was a bit like reading the Mabo act; it was like reading porridge. Certainly, in its turgid prose, I did not see the future in the glowing terms that Garnaut saw it, and I believe that history will vindicate me and not Mr Garnaut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Garnaut document was very flawed. It was a terrible time for wool producers, and they are not yet out of the maze. I believe that the future is looking brighter and that, if we can get the interplay of free enterprise and initiative of people in enterprise&mdash;initiative that was actually stifled under the Wool Corporation&mdash;we can see better days ahead.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I do indeed thank people who have contributed to the debate on the Wool International Amendment Bill 1997 and the very important Australian wool industry. It is an industry which has, indeed, seen some extraordinarily difficult times over recent years. In fact, for some six years now the majority of growers have lost money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At least until very recently, nine in 10 of Australia's wool growers were believed to be losing in terms of the overall performance of their businesses. No&hyphen;one in this place would wish that appalling prospect on what is a very important sector of the Australian economy. It is a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5678"> very important part of our social, as well as economic, fabric and there are many parts of the country which are really not suited to anything except wool production. Their communities are as badly damaged as growers and their businesses are, in those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, of course, tremendously encouraging to see the current lift in prices. The eastern market indicator at the moment is in the order of 720c, or thereabouts. We hope that the emerging new markets will lead to increasing demand at the retail level over time, and there have been some very worthwhile developments in this regard in recent months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In full fairness to the opposition and their role in setting it up, it was a great delight for the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) and I, for example, to be able to carry forward the deal under which we export wool tops and, if you like, expertise to Mexico without tariffs getting in the way. Our wool is value added there into garments for re&hyphen;export, again without tariffs under NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, into that very lucrative North American market. That is a trade which, from humble beginnings, is growing very rapidly and offers real prospects for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The loss of the Russian outlet for wool, which did so much damage in the late 1980s and early 1990s, is likely to be increasingly offset by the improving prospects for exports to India. Recently the Indian minister for textiles, who is in fact a cabinet minister&mdash;we do not have a minister, let alone a cabinet minister, for textiles in this country, but in India the minister for textiles is responsible for activities which provide a livelihood for 60 million Indians&mdash;spent a couple of days here. Again, Minister Fischer and I, and many officers from the department and other departments, spent a lot of time with the minister. He was as good as his word: we saw in the last budget announcements of substantial reductions in tariffs pertaining to Australian wool exports to that country. That, too, offers a real prospect that India will become a substitute market, over time, for Russia. They are even more bullish on their estimates of the amount of wool they are likely to be taking over the coming years than our more optimistic forecasters are in this country. So that is good news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recently met with the Chinese Vice&hyphen;Premier. I would be reluctant to attempt to extrapolate figures and actual numbers out of the broad commitments that he made. It is fair to say that, as they seek WTO accession&mdash;and we have indicated that we will strongly support that but that support will be more easily offered by us if they continue to offer us better access on wool&mdash;he made it plain that they understand that and that they are very committed indeed to ensuring that we go forwards, rather than either stall or, worse, go backwards in relation to our wool access into China. Those things I think are very encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In general terms, the government has been very cognisant indeed of the problems confronting the wool industry. I am not a wool grower, but all my forebears have been&mdash;I do not know whether I am allowed to talk about my rural activities, in terms of the chances of conflict of interest and so forth, but those are the historical facts of the matter. I know a lot of wool growers. I know how important they are to the economy in general and to their rural communities in particular, and it is of vital importance that we see the industry recover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifteen months ago I found a somewhat divided and dissolute industry, very disheartened and understandably demoralised. I formed the view very early on that whilst there were many things that we could do in a practical sense to help and to aid and abet recovery&mdash;opening up more markets being an obvious one&mdash;the maximisation of the potential of the industry would depend very heavily upon establishing a sense of unity, purpose and common direction, and ending the division within the industry. So we went through the process of two ministerial
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5679"> round tables here in Canberra where I pulled together the industry's leadership from right across the globe, from its many facets&mdash;because it is a many faceted industry&mdash;and we worked through some very vexed issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker spoke at great length about the Garnaut report and the fixed release schedule. While in opposition I supported the fixed release schedule. In an example of the sort of cooperation that perhaps the honourable members opposite would agree are too infrequently acknowledged in the broader community, the then minister Simon Crean and I were able to work through that whole very difficult period in a constructive way in what I believe was in the best interests of the wool industry. We put in place a rigid fixed release schedule at a time when wool prices, in terms of the eastern market indicator, were below 400c. As I recall, they had been as low as about 380&hyphen;odd and the industry was in a diabolical state, wondering whether it had a future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It had very little idea of what to do with the enormous stockpile and the debt hanging over it, and there was a sort of siege mentality prevailing at the time. The industry desperately needed some certainty and some guidelines that were new and would hold, and so we moved down that road of setting up Wool International and of establishing a board for it. It was eventually to be corporatised but, in the meantime, it had responsibility for reducing the wool stockpile on a very tight quantity reduction program in place of the previous arrangement which had been a debt reduction program&mdash;a very dangerous instrument for industry at that very difficult time of its career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that although it became very unpopular, the fixed released schedule gave the industry the certainty and the direction that it needed at a critical time in its history. There is no doubt in my mind&mdash;no doubt at all&mdash;that it was the right thing to do at the time and I do not resile from that for a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that under that fixed release schedule we really started to wind back in a disciplined, concrete way that the market came to understand and respect, to the point where today the stockpile is greatly reduced and the debt has come down from something like $2.8 billion to something of the order of $700 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me backtrack for a moment. Through the round table process, in conjunction with the government, the industry was able to work through in a constructive way a more sensible regime, given the progress that had been made by then for the handling of the stockpile. In a rational way we opened up the disposal schedule so that only a minimum requirement needs to be met on a quarterly basis, and a great deal more can be sold on a quarterly basis according to the prevailing market at the time. As a result of that, industry has now very appropriately shifted its focus away from management issues relating to the stockpile onto the much more important main game for the future of increasing demand. As I have outlined, I think that progress has been made there in terms of opening up new market opportunities, but we are also able to focus on the very important question of promotion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Promotion is designed to do two things. It will lock in such premiums as we can extract for wool over other fibres. You simply cannot turn a bob and produce wool at anything like the prices you can for alternative fibres such as cotton. It is an economic impossibility. You need a very real premium for a premium quality product. You have got to lock in such premiums as you are able to secure but then, given that those premiums have been, and remain, inadequate, you have got to seek ways to convince customers that it is worth paying a higher price for a higher quality product with the unique qualities that wool offers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5680">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some major objectives to be reached there and some major challenges. We know, for example, that five years ago under&hyphen;35s in Western countries had very little understanding of the qualities of wool or the desirability of the product. When asked, they said that they thought of it as a `natural' product, but it was expensive, hard to look after, short&hyphen;lived and not particularly fashionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now know five years on that under 40&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds have the same perception problem. Of course, if we keep going at that rate, in another five years it will be under 45&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and in 10 years it will be under 50&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, and we will all be gone. We have got to turn those perceptions around. We have got to get younger people, particularly for example in Europe, switched onto the desirability of wool as a product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year I went to Paris. I hasten to add that I do not go there very regularly. I went there exclusively for the wool industry's benefit and I hope we achieved something. They took us to a mid&hyphen;range store where young people buy their clothing. I was intrigued that in Paris&mdash;considered the height of fashion&mdash;I noticed with some horror that those appalling lime greens and burnt oranges that were around in the 1970s are apparently about to re&hyphen;emerge&mdash;or they were in Paris at the end of last year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not around in the fifties. One hopes for the best but the important point is that they seem to be targeting an appropriate group of younger, fashion&hyphen;conscious Europeans in an attempt to draw them back in, and I thought that was very encouraging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To come back to what is before us, the government has sought to work with the industry against a philosophical commitment to empower the industry to take control of its own destiny again, and to get out of the way where we hinder rather than help. It has been very important to draw the industry into a regime where it is conscious of the need to provide its own leadership, its own direction, post the collapse of the floor price, and post&mdash;as we are now increasingly `post'&mdash;the massive government involvement that was necessary in the winding back of the stockpile and in the statutory arrangements that pertain to that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, we have had a lot of legislation before the House as we have sought to progress that and, of course, what we are talking about today carries all of that further. It essentially indicates the timetable for the winding up of Wool International&mdash;the winding down of the size of the board, starting from the end of this year and, over time, by the year 2001, winding it up altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Originally the Crean legislation proposed that Wool International could be corporatised on its way to being privatised and handed back to the industry as its own marketing body and so forth. Over time, we have come to the realisation that there are more appropriate ways to proceed. Many members of the coalition have very strong views on that. What we have ended up with is an approach which says that it will be disbanded. The only surviving entity may be an entity that at this stage is loosely known as `Global Wool', a joint venture between Elders, Wesfarmers Dalgety, Wool International or, if you like, an offshoot of Wool International. It would be a trading and marketing company which growers would have the option of investing in, and I stress `option'. There would be no compulsion at all if Global Wool were to proceed; it would be entirely voluntary. Growers would have the option of investing in it if they so choose, or not investing in it if they did not want to be part of that joint venture.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5681">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It needs to be noted that, in contrast to what we thought would be the case in 1993 with a huge debt&mdash;as it was then&mdash;an enormous stockpile to be digested and very low wool prices, no&hyphen;one held out any real prospect that in the end there would be substantial equity for growers out of the whole exercise. But we now know differently. Although there is still a reasonable amount of wool to digest, on current indications, there will be considerable equity to be returned to the growers. We have announced that it will be several hundreds of millions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some growers will get a pretty nice cheque out of it and I say that is more power to them for the blood, sweat and tears of the last few years. It is a small return when you set it against the sorts of losses that they have experienced. I know it is very welcome and everywhere I go wool growers tell me how relieved they are and how much they look forward to it. The entitlement to that equity will flow through, starting with the first tranche of $81 million this year, and that specifically will be returns on section 51, the sale of non&hyphen;wool assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not got much time but I have given a bit of a broad overview of where I see the industry going and this legislation does provide growers who have paid wool tax between July 1993 and 1996 with entitlements to the equity of Wool International. In due course, they will receive the cash distributions of the surplus. Wool tax payers will be given unit holdings on the basis of a unit for every dollar of wool tax paid, and the units will be able to be traded at values the market applies to them from time to time. The Wool International register of these entitlements will be finalised in September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the interim and final payments of Wool International assets to wool tax payers, I am very pleased, as I have just indicated, that it will be about $81 million, which is more than the originally estimated $75 million. It is to be distributed equitably later this year&mdash;in fact, by December. There will be further payments in several tranches&mdash;probably two or three&mdash;over the next few years. And, as I said a moment ago, that is very pleasing indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the comment I made a moment ago about Global Wool, the legislation allows for the setting up of a growers investment trust, a special purposes investment vehicle&mdash;I will not spell out what that acronym is! Prior to that proceeding, I stress that Global Wool, as a concept, will need ACCC approval and then my approval before it can proceed, and Wool International will, in the meantime, have a cap on further expenditure on the feasibility study and the establishment of the trust of $1 million through to 30 June 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wool International will also be allowed to establish, through a public tender process, a loan facility by a financial institution for the benefit of wool growers with entitlements to the equity of Wool International. They will be required to complete the tender process by 31 December 1997, thus giving equity holders more choice in the use of their equity in a way that suits their individual needs. There is a reasonable expectation that this arrangement will produce more advantageous terms than would otherwise be available to wool taxpayers negotiating loan arrangements with lenders individually. Growers will be absolutely free to negotiate their own loan arrangements if they so choose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, I have touched on the phasing&hyphen;out of the functions of Wool International and the reduction in the board size. I have been very impressed by the industry's willingness to work very hard&mdash;and I pay tribute to the hardworking executive members of the Wool Council of Australia who are with us here today&mdash;as we have sought to work through the very real problems that the industry has faced in recent times.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5682">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The virtually unanimous support for the monumental changes to be implemented through this act shows the striking success, in my view, of that process, which I would like to think was kicked off by the wool round&hyphen;table arrangements, where the industry recognised not only that it was possible to work together, but that there were real benefits in doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was an enormous delight to me last year, during my very brief trip through Europe&mdash;Rome, Milan, Paris and Brussels&mdash;in talking to the wool industry, to our customers in that part of the world, to hear repeatedly that they again trust the Australian government after the enormous damage that was done by the promises of a certain previous minister&mdash;promises that were immutable, with cast&hyphen;iron guarantees, that proved not to be worth the paper they were written on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our overseas customers are looking forward to working in harmony with the Australian industry in the future. They still have major concerns about the issue of wool contamination&mdash;which I am not going to do anything more than touch on here today. Quality control, however, is obviously a major issue for the industry still to address as part of the effective promotion of the industry. In short, we have a long way to go before the industry is in clover again, so to speak, but we have made great progress. I thank the industry for its determined efforts to pull together. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill amends the International Monetary Agreements Act to allow Australia to comply with the IMF's new arrangements to borrow, which is to be a new line of credit provided by a group of countries to the International Monetary Fund, which the IMF would be able to draw on in the case of a financial emergency in one or more of its member countries to assist that country or those countries. The opposition does not oppose this legislation; indeed, it strongly supports it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go into the background of this measure for a little while. Firstly, it goes back to the Mexican crisis in December 1994, when private capital flooded out of that country as confidence in it suddenly evaporated following a string of high current account deficits&mdash;around eight per cent of GDP, as I recall&mdash;and led to reconsideration of the current international arrangements to respond to such a crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IMF provided substantial financial assistance to Mexico from its own resources, about $A24&half; billion&mdash;by far the largest amount ever provided to a single member&mdash;and further amounts were provided bilaterally, especially by the United States. The need for such large financial resources to be provided for a relatively small economy led to considerable rethinking about the capacity of the IMF to respond to a future possible crisis, especially to a larger economy than that of Mexico.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5683">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing formal mechanism for supplementing IMF resources in such a situation was termed the `general arrangements to borrow', a line of credit provided through the G10, which comprises the G7 countries of the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan, plus four smaller European countries&mdash;Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. That gives you 11 countries but it is still called the G10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This general arrangement to borrow was established in 1961 when, under the then system of fixed parity exchange rates, the US dollar and the pound sterling were frequently under strain. The breakdown of the fixed parity system reduced the need for general arrangements to borrow, which has not been called upon since 1978. Nevertheless, it has remained in existence and, indeed, was extended in 1983 following the Latin American debt crisis of that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next step along the way, following the resolution of the Mexican crisis with the financial assistance coming from the IMF and other ad hoc arrangements, was that the G7, at its meeting in Halifax, Canada, in June 1995, called for a doubling of the amount currently available under the general arrangements to borrow by the G10 and other countries with the capacity to support the system. So they were looking for others to assist the G10 in providing this kind of support mechanism at a time of international financial crisis for one or more countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue then became how to expand the GAB facility by bringing other countries into it. The simplest way was to expand the membership of the G10 so that, instead of having 11 members, it would have quite a few more. However, this was opposed by the smaller members of the G10 which were concerned that their privileged association with the G7 through this forum would be reduced. The role of the G10, of course, goes beyond the general arrangements to borrow&mdash;it acts as a caucus in the International Monetary Fund, in the OECD and also in the Bank of International Settlements. These smaller countries did not want other countries such as Australia to join the group. Accordingly, various other options were developed which would allow other countries outside the G10 to participate through separate arrangements parallel to the GAB, or through the establish of a new facility in addition to the GAB.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with all these proposals, as initially developed, was that they would treat the non&hyphen;G10 countries as subordinate to the G10&mdash;that is, with the same responsibilities but a lesser role in decision making. Australia rightly regarded this as wrong in principle and, in discussion on the IMF board in 1995, we made it clear that in our view all participants in any facility should be treated on an equal basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then in October 1995, at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund&hyphen;World Bank in Washington, I, as the Australian Treasurer at that time, made it clear that Australia would be prepared to participate in an expansion of the general arrangements to borrow, but only on three conditions. They were: firstly, that all participants should have the same rights and responsibilities&mdash;that is, there should be no second&hyphen;class citizens; secondly, that contributions should be based on the relative economic standing of participants; and, thirdly, that the new participants should participate fully in the activation arrangements and voting rights should be determined by the shares of the commitments. Later in 1995, the G10 developed a proposal to expand the GAB, but it did not adhere to Australia's three principles of participation. Australia, along with various other potential additional participant countries, made it clear that we did not accept the G10 proposal or, at least in the case of some countries, had strong reservations about it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5684">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next step along the way was in April 1996 when, at the APEC finance ministers meeting, Australia proposed the establishment of a new set of borrowing arrangements&mdash;that is, separate from the general arrangements to borrow&mdash;which would meet each of the three principles of participation that I had spelt out in the previous October. This became the basis of agreement and, by May of 1996, potential participant countries in this new arrangement had broadly agreed on how it would operate. Later in 1996, the detail was finalised and it was strongly supported at the IMF executive board level in January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The details of the new arrangements to borrow are that it will make available to the IMF an amount of up to $34 billion special drawing rights or $A61 billion, which compares to special drawing rights of $17 billion or $A30&hyphen;odd million under the general arrangements to borrow. This meets the requirement of the G10 that the facility be doubled in size. In respect of that overall amount, Australia's share will be $810 million special drawing rights or $A1.5 billion or thereabouts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new arrangement will not replace the general arrangements to borrow&mdash;it will be alongside them&mdash;but it will be the facility of first and principle recourse in the event of a need to provide supplementary finance to the IMF. The participants in the new arrangements to borrow, apart from the G10, are Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia&mdash;which had an associated arrangement with the GAB anyway&mdash;Spain, Singapore and Thailand. Thus, it is a markedly less Eurocentric group than the GAB, with a number of the dynamic east&hyphen;Asian economies represented as well as ourselves, Kuwait and some other Europeans, in addition, of course, to the G10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, accordingly, a much stronger and more durable arrangement than the GAB, with 13 more countries involved&mdash;a total facility worth twice the credit available to the IMF under the GAB. It, therefore, represents a major strengthening of the international monetary system which, in a world where vast amounts of private capital wash around the world everyday and which can suddenly take flight in a devastating way, this is a great reassurance in the durability of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, it is no guarantee that countries which do not adhere to sound economic policies will be free from concern. What the Mexico crisis demonstrated quite clearly was that, apart from the need for substantial financial resources to be available to a country facing capital flight, there is also an acute need to ensure that the economic policies in that country are such as to return the nation to economic stability. The crisis in Mexico only subdued after its policies were changed, policies which caused great pain to the Mexican people but without which they would not have resolved their financial crisis despite the massive IMF bail out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two additional points that I wish to raise. Firstly, in the event that Australia was required to make a contribution to the IMF fund of this facility, we could be required to produce $1.5 billion in a small period of time, which is not a small sum. This will either have to be borrowed by the Commonwealth&mdash;and provision for that is contained in this bill&mdash;or, in the event of a budget surplus, repayment of our debt would presumably be reduced to that extent. It is comforting to note that this would not have implications for the budget balance as it would be treated as a financing transaction below the line, which accords with international accounting practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would note, however, that, when I was Treasurer, the means of financing Australia's contribution that was then being contemplated by Treasury was for a line of credit from the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5685"> Reserve Bank of Australia to the IMF, not for it to be financed directly by the Commonwealth. This appears to be the way a number of countries have approached this issue, with Germany, Hong Kong, Sweden and Switzerland all represented in the new arrangements to borrow, not by their government, but by their central bank, which would seem to indicate that any call on those notions would be met directly by the central bank not the government. I would appreciate it if, in reply&mdash;if we are going to have one&mdash;the minister would advise the committee why it was that Treasury changed its mind on this issue and decided on government finance through the consolidated revenue fund rather than through the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, this is one of those measures on which both sides of the House can feel some pleasure and, indeed, ownership of a successful outcome in which Australia has played a leading role. I would particularly like to congratulate the Treasury officials involved for their constructive, innovative contribution on this matter, which broke an international deadlock and provided the means of considerably improving the safety and security of the international monetary system.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker alluded to the fact that this bill is before us as a result of what happened in Mexico. It is a very good investment of time to study what occurred in Mexico and what is occurring today in Mexico. For those of you who like listening to radio or tapes as you are driving along, I would strongly urge you to listen to Tom Fitzgerald's Boyer lectures of some years ago. Tom Fitzgerald was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  economics editor, and in that very fine exposition, he assessed the Australian economy and where it was going. He passed a very, very harsh judgment upon us. Let me quote verbatim from the lecture. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At no point of time in the future will the current account come into a state of balance. In fact, each year that we proceed, this country will go further and further in debt and have to carry the sins of the past which will be imposed upon the Australians of the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current account deficit has been fluctuating up and down, but there is no doubt that we are talking about a baseline which most certainly, if it is not rising, is staying static. That being the case, the country with each preceding year, as Fitzgerald said in those lectures, will become worse and worse off. As the Australian debt rises, the interest and repayments on that debt keep building upon themselves and have an exponential effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have come from a state where we had $23,000 million owing to foreign institutions. We now have a situation in Australia where around $200,000 million is owing to financial institutions. That is not getting better, but each day is getting worse, which brings me to the subject of the IMF. When you get really bad, the IMF steps in and starts dictating to you the policy that you carry out in your country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economies of Central and South America are often portrayed in the American media as if they were those of irresponsible Latin people who really could not run a country properly. I think a more fair assessment of Central and South America is the complete domination of those economies by the interests of the United States and the complete domination and submergence of their national interests to the national interests of those of the United States. With the United States now in a position that it is dictating policy to Mexico, it is very hard to see how that country can realise upon the potential of its citizens. If someone else is calling the tune in your country, then of course you are not in a very happy situation. Sovereignty is not a word that has much meaning to you.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5686">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, if we can go in a period of one decade from $23,000 million to $200,000 million, the situation is a very, very desperate one in this country today. In reflecting upon this, I must reflect upon the fact that we have a very narrow base of export earnings in this country&mdash;a very, very narrow base indeed. In fact, only eight items comprise 60 or 70 per cent of this nation's entire income&mdash;the big eight. Throw in the tourism industry and it is the big nine. Of those, four of them are agricultural products&mdash;cattle, wool, wheat and sugar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cattle numbers are down by 25 or 30 per cent on where they were a decade or so ago. Wool is down by some 30 or 40 per cent&mdash;depending upon which set of figures which you wish to rely on&mdash;and falling. In the cattle industry, one&hyphen;quarter of the trade within two years will be live cattle: instead of selling a beast for $1,500 per head, we will be selling it for only $300 per head, and the current account implications of that are very diabolical. We are growing wheat everywhere we can in Australia now, and so there is no chance of expansion in wheat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Thailand gets over the drought that they have been having, and when the restrictions upon Cuba are removed, the price of sugar is expected to fall through the floor. ABARE's predictions are very grim indeed for the sugar industry. The outlook in agriculture is diabolical indeed. The implications for the IMF and the current account for this country are very grim indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to mining, I was saying the other day that, under the level playing field idea, the big international mining companies will impose upon Australia the same wage levels that they have in South America and other countries which, for a number of reasons, we used to refer to as Third World countries. I said that the wage structure of such countries as Chile will be imposed upon the mining industry of Australia, and that CRA has mines in both of those countries, so why would it treat our miners better than it treats their miners?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very surprised to be rebutted by being told that the wages in Chile are very similar to the wages in Australia. These countries are leaping forward. They now have sophisticated staff to mine their mines over there. They enjoy, in spite of the remarks that I have just made, wage advantages over this country. Also, because of the enormous power of the multinational companies in Central and South America and in Africa&mdash;countries which are economically on their knees and which desperately need the mining revenue, and so are prepared to give the mining companies anything they want&mdash;such things as environmental considerations are not taken much notice of in Africa or South America; and that gives them tremendous advantages, cost wise, over us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking at copper, one of the big eight in Australia, falling straight through the floor because five massive overseas mines are coming on stream and we cannot possibly compete against them. Russia is opening up huge areas&mdash;and it must have far and away the most extensive mineral resources in the world; but, because of communism, it has not been able to competitively exploit those resources which, of course, it now can. So our mining industry, which has been the juggernaut of the Australian economy, is in a very grave situation indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, on tourism, at both the Gold Coast and Cairns we are getting figures of 20 and 30 per cent reductions in tourism for this year. In all three sectors of the economy that we rely upon, the outlook is diabolical indeed. If you think there is going to be a turnaround in the current account, I have got grim news for you, my friend&mdash;grim news indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said all those things, I come back to the fact that there is no point in putting our heads in the sand. We have to face up to reality. If you are wanting to know what needs to be done to address the problems that are going to rapidly arise for Australia&mdash;with respect to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5687"> the IMF and the fact that we might be not a country that is called upon to put in money but one that has to ask for money and have terms dictated to us&mdash;we have to look at where the problems lie in the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the most successful economy on earth&mdash;and this has a lot to do with other implications of the IMF proposals that are coming forward here. The most successful economy on earth, by far and away, is Japan. Its balance of payments&mdash;to be technical&mdash;was $130,000 million. To put that in perspective, ours was a deficit of nearly $20,000 million, whilst theirs was a surplus of $130,000 million. The United States had a deficit last year of $106,000 million. Japan has an enormously successful economy. What makes it so different from the other economies on earth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other statistic which I should refer to is that the average income of a person in Japan is $36,000; the average income of an American is $24,000. That is quite remarkable. I was very surprised at that figure, which the library provided to me, and I confirmed it from the United States and Japan. Why is Japan so enormously successful? I think the major answer to that is in interest rates. The average interest rate in Australia in 1995 were 7.7 per cent, the average interest rate in Japan was 1.2 per cent, and the average interest rate in the United States was six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, if business and development oriented business can access interest rates that are that low, they will move forward with great confidence and with very little fear imposed upon them. Clearly, that is the biggest differentiating statistic that one can look at in characterising the Japanese economy. If you want to wind back to before the bolsheviks, the socialists, took over Australia, we had a situation where our agricultural and other developing industries, most certainly mining in the case of Queensland, could access money&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I am providing interest rates of one per cent to business, I think I am very much on the side of business. Until our friends sitting opposite took over the running of this country with their enlightened economic rationalism&mdash;which they now seem to be running away from, after having imposed that disaster upon Australia for 13 years&mdash;we could access money through the Primary Industry Bank, the Commonwealth Development Bank, through QIDC in Queensland and various similar institutions in the other states. There was a whole range of financial institutions through which anyone who had a business which would result in the growth of the Australian economy, or a development oriented project, could access interest rates far, far lower than the rates that applied to the rest of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compounded on that was the removal of every other way of controlling the economy in Australia except interest rates. To quote again from Fitzgerald's lectures, the `bluntest of blunt instruments' was used to control the Australian economy&mdash;one single blunt instrument. If we had a very bad inflationary problem, as we did, starting with the Whitlam regime&mdash;if I could score a political point here&mdash;which would create great problems in terms of the International Monetary Fund and our situation financially with the other states of the world, it had to be restrained. So we restrained it with massive interest rates. In days past, we used statutory reserve deposits, and that sort of mechanism, to pull in a situation of inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Admittedly, there were other factors involved, such as wages. But our relationship financially with the rest of the world, which is governed by the International Monetary Fund, was very seriously placed in jeopardy by the inflationary pressures that existed. We used that one single blunt instrument called interest rates and we used that instrument to put rates up enormously
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5688"> high, to 15 per cent and at one stage even 20 per cent, throughout this country. Of course, when you were competing against the Japanese economy, where interest rates were down around two and three per cent, you were going to take one massive hiding in the international competitive trade arena. That is most certainly what occurred to Australia during that period. We took one massive hiding because our businesses that wanted to get off the ground could not possibly borrow money at that level. Day after day, those that existed were falling over. Bankruptcies in Australia rose from around 4,000 in 1983 to 17,500 last year, and they are still rising as a result of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we could go back and impose the enlightened attitude of a sovereign Australia where we provided investment opportunities with interest rates that were comparable to the rest of the world and, in many cases, much lower than the rest of the world&mdash;there was the 60&hyphen;40 arrangement in Australia where a very large percentage of all superannuation funds had to go into government banks and that money was rechannelled back out into the economy&mdash;we would not be mendicants of the IMF, but playing a useful role in helping other countries as we did some 15 years ago before the madness of economic rationalism took over this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me start by thanking speakers in this debate. It is a very important bill. I would just like to record my appreciation, also, for the opposition's support which was indicated in the contribution from the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been noted, the key impetus for the New Arrangements to Borrow, to which this bill provides for Australia's participation, were the difficulties experienced in Mexico in late 1994 and the associated concerns about the adequacy of the IMF's resources to cope with possible future crises of the international financial systems. The New Arrangements to Borrow were progressively developed from that point following those events. Australia played a very significant role in the establishment of the New Arrangements to Borrow and for this we can be justly proud. The member for Gellibrand, I am sure, recalls his time in government when this initiative was developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has already been noted, this bill essentially serves two purposes. Firstly, it will enable Australia to adhere to the International Monetary Fund's New Arrangements to Borrow, and, secondly, it will simplify the framework for Australia's financial transactions with the IMF. The New Arrangements to Borrow, the NAB, as it is shortened to, will double the IMF's capacity to borrow to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system, or to deal with an exceptional situation that poses a threat to the stability of that system. The NAB will therefore enhance the IMF's ability to safeguard the international monetary system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the NAB, Australia may be called on to lend up to SDR$810 million, or about A$1.5 billion to the IMF. There is flexibility in this arrangement. In certain circumstances, Australia will be able to opt out of a call under the NAB and may also request early repayment of a loan under the NAB.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Gellibrand raised a question during his contribution. He asked why the government has decided to finance a call under the NAB through the CRF. The government wanted the Commonwealth to be a participant in the NAB because decisions on whether to opt out of a call raised very critical policy issues that necessitate a proposed method. And, so that the proposed method is also consistent with the way we conduct our other transactions with the IMF, it is therefore an appropriate response from the government. Again, may I express my appreciation for the contributions and the participation of the people in the debate today and also indicate to the opposition that we thank them for their support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill and the cognate bill seek to maintain the exemption from state taxes and charges applying to Commonwealth vehicles. The minister in his speech tried to imply that this was just a technical amendment required to maintain the status quo once the government privatises Dasfleet. Nothing could be further from the truth. The privatisation of Dasfleet would represent a change in ownership of the vehicles. The minister advanced no reason why everyone else should pay state taxes and charges on their vehicles but not the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should the `battlers' we kept hearing about from the other side before the last election have to pay their motor vehicle taxes and charges, but not the Commonwealth? This is the essence of the issue here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the government's supposed commitment to the principles of competitive neutrality? The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) said on 20 August 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The application of full competitive neutrality will mean that DAS businesses will face equivalent payments, debt guarantee fees and dividend payments, even when they are competing for Commonwealth Government contracts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At the first whiff of grapeshot, these principles go out the window.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue also exposes the government's hypocritical approach to privatisation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If privatisation is such a good financial deal, why does it need a subsidy? Such a subsidy is at the expense of state taxpayers, schools, hospitals, police services and all the other things state governments are responsible for. What about the attempt of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to impose all Commonwealth taxes on the states last year? One would have thought that what was good for the goose is good for the gander, but not when it comes to this government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) for his very brief contribution. Nothing could be further from the truth in terms of the government's asset sale program. Effectively what these bills do is to maintain the status quo. Currently the taxes and charges, the self&hyphen;insurance provisions, apply in respect of the Commonwealth's fleet. It is the intention of the government, as it was the intention of the former government, to dispose of that car fleet. Effectively, this legislation maintains the current position, despite the fact that the cars will be owned by the private sector and leased back to the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that regard, the member for Sydney indicated that the government sought to impose these taxes and charges&mdash;that is, the Commonwealth's taxes and charges in respect of motor vehicles, the stamp duty provisions, the sales tax provisions&mdash;on the states during the course of the special Premiers Conference last year. That was not the case. In that instance, the Commonwealth gave the option to the states to make their contribution to fiscal consolidation either by way of the financial assistance grants or by way of imposing a very transparent and very up&hyphen;front process on such issues in respect of motor vehicles as sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states chose&mdash;in my view, surprisingly&mdash;to maintain their advantage in respect of motor vehicles, particularly on the sales tax exemption, and to make their contribution by way of a reduction for 2&half; years in respect of the financial assistance grants. So the member for Sydney has got it wrong. This particular bill will enable the Commonwealth to simply get out of the ownership of a very large fleet of some 18,000 vehicles. There is no need for the Commonwealth to be the owner of that. The provision of those vehicles can be supplied, as it is to many states and to many private companies, by the private sector, and the provisions that currently apply will apply in that regard. It does not give an advantage to the private sector in any shape or form. It simply maintains the provisions that are now there to the extent that there is a need to have that fleet and there always will be. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The budget appropriations this year for Defence are particularly important. They address a whole range of important policy initiatives and a series of decisions that the current government has made. In fact, it has been a period of more decisions than policy, regrettably; a period in which there has been decision by press release, in which there has been an absence of policy, and in which our neighbours look with some bewilderment at what it is that Australia now sees for itself in terms of its own security and its interaction with the region and the wider world. Regrettably, it has also been a period in which a string of decisions without any direction or policy has produced, within the ranks of service personnel and people in the department, a drop in morale which is now reaching proportions of serious concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the course of the consideration in detail of this bill, I hope to make a number of contributions dealing with a series of different topics. At the outset, it is important to comment on the confusing signals which this government has been issuing in relation to its view of its place in the region. No strategic analysis has been released. In fact, I believe that no proper strategic analysis has been undertaken by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A little over a year ago when this government came to office it had the opportunity to endorse the former government's strategic analysis or to institute a new one. The Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) and the government decided to do neither at that time. Subsequently, the government has decided that it will institute its own strategic review. Unfortunately, it has decided to do that far too late in its three&hyphen;year term. That is compounded by the fact that, without any concept of a strategic review in mind, it set about making some of the most
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5692"> significant changes to the defence force structure this country has seen in more than two generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has proclaimed the army restructure and the defence efficiency review in those terms, and yet they have been done without any consideration of what it is that Australia needs to defend itself. It has been done without any consideration of what it is that Australia confronts in the region and in the world, or of what our place in the region and the world is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having jumped step 1 and step 2, which should have been a proper force structure analysis, we have no strategic review and no force structure analysis, this government has set about a major restructure of the army. It has set about a major restructure of the defence organisation&mdash;I will say some more about the DER later. Suffice to say at this point that the defence efficiency review is not something I regard as being confined to administrative matters. I will detail my reasons for that subsequently, but the DER clearly goes beyond administrative considerations in matters of efficiency and, in doing so, should have been at least delayed until there was some serious concept in the mind of this government of our place in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the case. It has become very evident in a series of statements made by the minister that either he has a confused view, or that the department and his office have a confused view. On each occasion that these confused views have been put into the public domain and reported accordingly, the minister has replied the next day, saying how he has been terribly misquoted. The first time that happened last year&mdash;and I can recall it quite well, as it was at a conference here in Parliament House in May&mdash;I gave the minister the benefit of the doubt and thought, `Well, fair enough, some poor journalist has given the wrong slant to it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it happened some months later when the minister appeared on the Channel 9 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program&mdash;I think it was last July. He made the offhand comment that the Americans might like to establish a naval base in Darwin. When these ideas are thrown around by senior ministers of the government in the public domain they actually have some importance. They have some weight. That is the sort of offhand comment a minister might make in a private conversation. He might get away with it as a second&hyphen;rate shadow minister, but a minister should not get away with it when he has the responsibility of government on his desk and the responsibility of the defence forces on his shoulders. He should not make statements like that in his position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also should not have talked about the upcoming meetings with American senior officials following shortly after that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program in July. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> It became clear in subsequent meetings with the officials in the United States that they had no interest in talking about a naval base, or even something less substantial than that. At the same time the minister was floating the prospect&mdash;and it was not just the Minister for Defence, as I think the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Downer) got into the act as well&mdash;of prepositioning American equipment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I recall, when the US Secretary of Defense was asked by the Australian media about that on the eve of the talks, he said, `It is not on the agenda.' The Americans had no interest in pursuing it yet, for some weeks prior to that, senior government ministers were floating those ideas around. I think it was part of a public relations spin that the government wanted to put on its defence policy. It wanted to somehow say, `Our defence posture is different from the former government's defence posture and, in relation to our critical alliance with the United
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5693"> States, as a new Liberal government, as a new coalition government, our relationship is better than the former Labor government's relationship with America.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand why the government, for some political gain, might want to put that twist on it, but everybody in the defence and foreign affairs organisation understands quite well that that was never the case. The relationship with the United States under the former government was extremely close, as it is under this government. That is only proper and it is something on which there is a bipartisan view. But putting that public relation spin on it, as the government sought to do, generated a lot of questions in the minds of people around the globe, and particularly in this part of the world, by talking about joint deployments with the United States troops in our region. When the government starts talking up joint deployments with the United States in our region, I guess a few people in the region start asking in which country in the region joint deployments are anticipated. I think that is not an unreasonable sort of response that people in the region might have to that sort of proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall the rhetoric that the government used, for example, in relation to the Tandem Thrust exercise, a major joint exercise. The government claimed great credit for having established the Tandem Thrust arrangements, saying that this was a new symbol of some closer ties when it was, frankly, a figment of the imagination of the PR people. I am indebted to the minister for acknowledging, on one occasion in the parliament, that the Tandem Thrust exercise was set in train by the former Labor government. It is not something that we have sought to criticise the government about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I do get concerned about is the small&hyphen;minded public relations spin that the government sought to put on the Tandem Thrust exercise in its early days and following the Ausmin talks, claiming it as theirs and trying to say, `Here's the evidence that we have a much closer relationship with America than the former Labor government.' But when there were a few questions, comments and concerns flying about regarding the Tandem Thrust exercise, we had the government saying, `Really, it wasn't the coalition's initiative. This was actually a Labor initiative and we followed it through.' Yes, it was a Labor initiative, and yes, the government did follow it through, and yes, we support that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government seems not to understand is that the public relations spin it puts on these things has an impact not just on the Australian psyche but also on the views of others in the region, because it is not taken in isolation. It is taken on the back of the enormous incompetence displayed by the government, and particularly the foreign minister, in things like the DIFF program, which strained relations with many key countries. Those sorts of statements are seen together. They are seen together with the debate about the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and with the way in which the Prime Minister actually defended that member's right to go and say all the things she said. But then when people like the Lord Mayor of Brisbane come out and attack the member for Oxley what does the Prime Minister do? The Prime Minister actually attacks the Lord Mayor of Brisbane for having the hide to criticise her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in the region watch this, and they put it all together and say, `What is the new relationship with the United States that this new Liberal government talks about? What is their attitude to us, given what they have done to DIFF? What is their attitude to multiculturalism and engagement with the region when, at the most senior levels in government, they actively support the sorts of comments that the Independent member for Oxley makes and criticise those in the Labor Party who attack her?' All of those things go toward building confusion
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5694"> in the region and they go directly to the question of national security, because so much of national security is about the perceptions which people have, one of the other, and their relationship with the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go directly to some of the comments the minister has made. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The minister has complained, following a number of his speeches, that he has been unfairly treated by the media. I think that Brian Toohey, who I must confess is not one of the journalists I would often cite&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to departmental insiders, the best insight into the `authentic' McLachlan&mdash;the one whose extempore public utterances are an accurate reflection of his private views&mdash;can be gleaned from his remarks on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>  on the Ten Network in April.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>  interview certainly evoked a few responses around the country. I read the response that the minister gave to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> , and managed to persuade the editorial writer at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  to write an editorial on the Tuesday actually attacking their own front page of the day before.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us look not just at what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> said but at what everyone in the country said. When the minister spoke on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>, he made a whole series of statements which I will not go into on this occasion, as I am sure there will be another opportunity for me to do so. Let us have a look at what they said, because the minister said that he was improperly interpreted. He was improperly interpreted by everybody in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> heading said, `Our troops ready to help South Korea, Minister says.' The first sentence says, `The Minister for Defence, Mr McLachlan, has signalled that Australia will consider sending forces to help defend South Korea if starving and unstable North Korea launches a desperate attack.' The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> thought that was the tenor of what you were on about. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> said, `Our troops may fight in foreign conflicts.' The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> said, `Troops on call for war in Asia' and the first sentence of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5695"> that front page article said, `Troops could be sent to fight internal conflicts in Asia as Australia adopted a tougher approach to regional threats, Defence Minister Ian McLachlan said yesterday.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in Melbourne got it wrong, too, because it said, `Australia may fight in civil wars overseas.' So far, we have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>, and now the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, getting it wrong. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> said, `Australia may send troops overseas to help friendly nations fight civil wars in the future, the Defence Minister Ian McLachlan indicated yesterday.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> got it wrong as well. We have got poor journalism in this country: all the papers misunderstood the minister! The minister clearly has an identification crisis here. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> said, `World is our battlefield: Minister widens military posture.' The first sentence of that article is, `Defence Minister Ian McLachlan dramatically widened Australia's defence posture yesterday by saying Australian troops could be deployed anywhere freedom was under threat, including allies' international conflicts.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> got it wrong as well. There is not a decent paper in the country, Minister. It is hard to get a good journalist. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> had a heading that said, `Defence strategy switch: Minister'. The article introduction said, `Australia is preparing to significantly change its defence posture, rejecting the coastline defence strategy of the past decade and designing defence capabilities for action in the furthest reaches of the region.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> misunderstood him as well. They said, `Defence strategy widened'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> in Adelaide said `The nation's defence focus widens' and the first sentence was `Australian troops could be deployed anywhere freedom was under threat, the Defence Minister said.' And so it went on. But this was not the only occasion the minister has been misrepresented. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> It is probably the most recent one, because those examples were from April this year, but I could cite a number of other examples. I have mentioned the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, and the views about the United States. There is one, though, that I should mention because it came up during the course of last week and the minister raised it in parliament, and it has to do with our relationship with China, which is a critically important relationship and, indeed, a very important area on which I would prefer to see a united bipartisan view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the decision of the Chief of the Defence Force to go to China. I note the progress that has been made there by him and Hugh White. I think that is a very worthwhile and desirable thing. Part of the problem is that we are in the process of patching up a relationship that has become worse because of blundering over the course of the last 15 months. The relationship Australia had with China was, I think, a very mature and mutually advantageous one at all levels and in all spheres, whether in terms of trade, security or diplomacy. The relationship with China that this government inherited from the former Labor government was a very good one indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we saw through those things I have just mentioned, and particularly the blundering of the foreign minister in the DIFF program, was a worsening of that relationship&mdash;not assisted, I might say, by the Minister for Defence. One of those occasions when he was no doubt misunderstood was in August last year when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> reported with the headline, `McLachlan criticises China'. Those sorts of statements that are made off the cuff by a senior minister and one with security responsibilities do us harm. It might be better if the briefs provided by departments to the minister, particularly in this area, were dealt with a little bit
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5696"> more closely by the minister and we avoided these off&hyphen;the&hyphen;cuff comments. They do go to what happens to force structure. They actually do impact on your security in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That goes back to my first point. The first thing this government should have done was sit down and, in its own mind, determine what it saw as our place in the world and what it saw as our strategic position. Frankly, had I been the incoming minister, that is exactly what I would have done. There should have been a new strategic review with the new incoming government and everyone would have said, `Fine, you're entitled to do that; go for it and make it public and put your stamp on it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having done that, you then sort out what you think the structure of defence should be; you need to address that and you then set about building that structure. We skipped the first two steps with this government and went about making a whole series of changes in the structure. I think that is very much the cart before the horse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should make one final comment in terms of the strategic situation before I move on to other matters. That is to say that some time later this year the minister will have the final report of the strategic review. I would be willing to bet good money that the minister has already seen drafts of the strategic review. When that final document is available, I would simply urge him to ensure that there is a public release of a suitable document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this matter has been raised in the past&mdash;and it has been raised in estimates committees; it has been raised directly by the media with the minister&mdash;he has declined to give a commitment. In fact, at the estimates committee his departmental people nearly got stumped because they intuitively said, yes, there would be a publicly released version, only to be told very quickly that no, that is not the minister's position. They had to retract that in the estimates committee and say that this was a matter that the minister would give consideration to when the report was finally done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister and Madam Deputy Speaker, the public release of a strategic review document I think is very important. We have led the region over the last decade in providing some transparency and in building confidence about what our view of the world is. We have encouraged other people in the region to do precisely the same and we have had success. In recent years we have seen a number of countries move to our model of a publicly released strategic review. It is a confidence building measure, not just between us and our neighbours, but amongst all the peoples of our region. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> It is important that we do not retreat from making available a public document that sets out our view of the region. As I said, we have been successful in encouraging others in the region to do the same. The minister has not ruled it out but he has certainly cast doubt on that in the press conference at the release of the DER and again through the Senate estimates committee. If the minister can confirm that there will be a document publicly released, I can assure him that that decision will be greatly welcomed by me and the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of things that are important in terms of the structure, and I should make some comment about the defence efficiency review because, whilst the budget papers are scant in relation to that, certainly in this financial year we will see a number of very important changes made to the structure of the defence forces as a result of the defence review program. The defence efficiency review is now translated into a defence review program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This defence review program is a bit like the phantom: it is everywhere and it is nowhere. This is the phantom set of documents or set of decisions. The minister might not just aid public debate and accountability in the parliament. He might help inform some of his own
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5697"> senior staff who are somewhat bewildered, as are the rest of us, with what actually constitutes the government's response to the defence efficiency review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has spoken about a DRP, defence review program, and we have had press releases from the minister, as is his want, to announce major changes&mdash;press releases, again, without policy. So we have this series of decisions, and one of them says, `There is going to be a defence review program and we intend to have the whole lot of this in place by 1 July.' One of the things that became apparent after about six minutes of questioning at the Senate estimate's committee only last week is that, at the most senior levels, the people in the Defence Department have not got a clue what the DRP is. That is not because they are not good and proper officials, it is because the direction and guidance from government is simply not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us see a consolidated DRP. Let us see a consolidated government response. Let us see the detail of what the government plans to do in pursing those matters that were identified by the defence efficiency review. It does not exist. There is not even a collation of orders from the CDF. There is no document that can be identified. There is no collation of documents that can be identified as the defence review program. If there is, I would invite the minister to describe it, identify them in this debate. Better still, let them become available for some sort of public scrutiny or at least let a public version of them become available so that the people of Australia will have some idea of what it is that this government intends to do with the defence forces of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fairly fundamental area of accountability I would have thought. The government should tell the people of Australia what it is doing with the defence forces of Australia. To date, what we have got is a one&hyphen;page press release and a lot of confused answers from senior officers of the Department of Defence who themselves are trying to figure out what the heck it is that the government wants of them. This is a major management question that the government has simply glossed over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to some of the things that are probably in the defence review program because they are certainly in the defence efficiency review, at least that document is public. There is to be a significant cut in the number of defence personnel. We are, I think, anticipating a civilian and uniform personnel, full&hyphen;time, change of 8,000 positions, 5,000 of those being uniform. Of those 5,000 uniform positions, about 2,200 are anticipated to be shifted to other areas, which leaves you with a net cut between 2,500 and 3,000 uniformed personnel. That is in the first tranche.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a second tranche that covers some 13,000 positions and, of those 13,000 positions, I believe 5,000 of those are uniform. I believe the estimate of how many uniform positions are likely to go out of that is about 3,000. So we are looking at a reduction in uniformed strength of about 5,000 directly as a result of this efficiency review. This goes to force structure. It is not about how to make the place run more efficiently. It is changing the very bricks and mortar that make up the defence force. This is force structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who did this review? It was not done by people experienced in force structure and defence matters, it was done by a committee, half of whose members have experience in financial management. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> They are people who work for Western Mining, people who manage the funds in AMP, and John Stone of all people, a former discredited, defeated National Party senator and former Secretary of the Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are people who you might actually want to look through accounting procedures, but they are not the people who you ask, `How many soldiers do you need? How many aircrew
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5698"> do you need? Do you need a RAAF base in Richmond?' They are the decisions they have made. These are people whose expertise in defence you could write on the back of a postage stamp, and you handed to them the opportunity to restructure the entire defence force&mdash;and that is what they have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us forget all this gobbledegook about how it was only about efficiency and saving dollars. When you cut 5,000 uniform people and about another 10,000 civilians out of an organisation, when you propose the sale of major defence bases, when you propose to amalgamate the first division deployable headquarters with NORCOM&mdash;which is actually in your DER documents&mdash;when you propose those sorts of fundamental force structure changes, forget about all this rhetoric telling me and others that this is about efficiencies. It has got nothing to do with efficiencies&mdash;well, it does to the extent that those people were set a task of finding somewhere between $500 million and $1,000 million a year, and they did that for you. But in doing that, they went to the very heart of force structure questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, they did all this without any guidance on what our strategic position was&mdash;that is, what is the threat against which we are establishing a force structure? So they have gone about doing all those things in the absence of any of that policy, and the people who did it were the wrong people anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are we going to end up with after army restructure, the defence efficiency review and the other cuts in the budget to staffing? My recollection is that the budget also cuts the establishment of uniform personnel by 1,000, which is separate to those cuts I have just mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, we will end up with a permanent uniform force in Australia of about 50,000 people, and the end of the day is pretty soon. The end of the day is about two or three years down the track. We will have 50,000 full&hyphen;time uniform personnel. In army, air force and navy, the total strength will be 50,000 full&hyphen;time uniform personnel. That represents the lowest number of full&hyphen;time uniform personnel that Australia has had since 1962. This government will preside over a cut in uniform strength in the full&hyphen;time defence personnel to levels not seen since 1962.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Army is personnel intensive. Army says of air force and navy that they crew the equipment&mdash;or, to use the sexist terminology, they man the equipment&mdash;but, in army, you equip the man, you equip the soldier. In army, where it is people intensive, as part of this process this government has initiated, the permanent numbers will be reduced to 20,000 full&hyphen;time people. That is the lowest number of full&hyphen;time uniform personnel in the army this country has seen since 1951.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the result of what the government have done, and they have done all this without a strategic review and without a force structure analysis. They will reduce the defence forces to their lowest level in 40 years, without any concept of where we are in the region and what the structure of our forces should be to address that analysis. That is gross incompetence. But worse than gross incompetence, it presents for Australia a major problem. If at the next election there is a change of government, it will present for us, as the new government, with major challenges to put right those things which you will already have undone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The course the government have set upon is not something that can be reversed overnight. I think the government have made a number of serious mistakes in the way in which they have gone about these things&mdash;as they did when they decided to abolish the ready reserve.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5699">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ready reserve ended this year. It was one of the most capable brigades in the organisation. The pity of it was that the minister chose not to accept the advice of the army and the chiefs in the ADF about the need to retain the ready reserve. He stuck to a fairly blinkered dogma that he inherited from his predecessor, the shadow minister in the last parliament. That was a wrong decision. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of those young men and women who made up the ready reserve will regrettably be departing the scene. They chose not to be in the general reserve. They chose to be in the ready reserve. Some of them certainly will want to be in the permanent force, and I know a number have transferred to the permanent force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of them specifically wanted to be in the ready reserve because it was unique and had a different set of conditions and opportunities. I fear that many of those people will walk out the door. We will lose those very young, capable and talented people. I would urge the government to reconsider that. It was the wrong decision and I would happily publicly applaud a decision of the government to re&hyphen;establish it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have touched on the question of army restructure in passing in terms of the global numbers. A number of things about the army restructure which give rise to concern are embedded in the budget proposals before us at the moment. Again, the degree to which this amount of change is understood and to which there is a plan and it fits with the defence efficiency review or DRP is a cause of a great deal of confusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make some comment about the Holsworthy base because that has come under some significant scrutiny. The Department of Defence has a committee that is looking at what they will do, if Holsworthy has to close as a defence base, to make way for a second airport. As the minister should know, that committee has also had to consider not just what happens at Holsworthy, but also the impact on surrounding airports&mdash;both civil and military&mdash;and the impact on the opportunity for live firing ranges in that important part of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is moving much closer to a decision of having Holsworthy as the second Sydney airport. I think that is an insane proposition. Assuming that they can overcome the problems of unexploded ordnance&mdash;and we do need to understand this has been a live firing range since the Rum Corps days&mdash;and assuming that they do not mind bulldozing through gorges that are 150 feet high, most of which have been laden with unexploded ordnance over the last 100 years or so, the minister might like to comment on what the budgetary implications will be for the $150 million worth of new buildings that have been erected in and around the Holsworthy base over the last five years. Some, I think, would be ongoing. They certainly were in the last budget and possibly are in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister might like to tell us what he proposes to do with those facilities that are costly, purpose&hyphen;built and brand new, if Sydney's second airport happens to be a stone's throw away from them. He might also like to tell us where the assets would be relocated to, what the cost of that would be and whether Defence will be supplemented for any of those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this has meant that personnel in the Defence Force have had to endure a series of changes without any clear guidance. They have had to endure the uncertainty of not knowing whether they have a job. They have had to endure the uncertainty that, even if they have a job after this round of cuts, they can look forward to the prospect that sometime in the next couple of years there will be a fresh round of cuts and their head might be in the noose for that one. That would be bad enough.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5700">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the government has decided to injure Defence personnel through other measures. The Medicare surcharge, for example, is unlike the basic Medicare charge which Defence personnel have a rebate on. If they have a family, they only pay half the Medicare fee because Defence picks up the service person's costs. For reasons best known to the government, they decided to slug the Defence personnel with the entire surcharge rather than half of it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it would not be hard. They have decided to impose upon service personnel the new superannuation surcharge tax for those people who do no more than agree to their request to stay on as pilots and air traffic controllers.

I am sure they will be delighted to learn about that. It was a fairly underhanded way of doing it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last issue that I want to talk about is defence industry. This budget is going to span a very critical period in defence industry matters. There will be the sale of ADI, if we can take the minister's comments at face value, and the legislated sale of AIDC, which brings with it the prospect of the sale of the government's shareholdings in the Submarine Corporation. In this area, I have to say that defence industry policy is not much different from general government industry policy: it is non&hyphen;existent. If its strategic policy is one of the spaghetti bowl approach to clarity, then I have to say that its industry policy is simply not there at all. That is the case in defence industry as it is generally in industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any person in this parliament, from either side of politics, who spends more than five minutes talking to industry leaders will be told that up&hyphen;front very quickly because they are angry and confused: angry because, by and large, they supported the election of this government, and very angry that, having done that, they now find industry policy jettisoned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make a couple of quick observations about that. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in March this year, noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The manufacturing sector said yesterday that Government cost cutting in the last Federal Budget had almost halted a decade of growth in manufactured exports by the end of 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the government was also told that the lack of a comprehensive industry policy focused on winning and retaining investment could result in much of Australia's installed production base disappearing in coming years as multinational companies reassessed their current investments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What that means is that there is no industry policy. They are saying that there is a lack of comprehensive industry policy, and they are right. In defence terms, the person charged with that responsibility is the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop). You have got to say that that is probably part of the problem rather than part of the solution. The Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel has given to coining a phrase, `Bishop's principles'. She actually gives speeches at industry forums, trying to talk up her own self&hyphen;importance by referring to Bishop's principles.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5701">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spend a lot of time talking to people in industry, and have done for some years, particularly when I was chairing the parliament's industry committee and I have not heard one of them refer to Bishop's principles. But the minister has a habit of referring to Bishop's principles. She gave great heart to the industry sector when she gave a speech in February of this year on defence and industry&mdash;future directions under a coalition government. The hard&hyphen;hitting part of it where she was laying down the markers&mdash;this is what Minister Bishop was going to do for defence industry&mdash;she came on strong and said, `It can also count on my personal support.' This is where we get to the important part, because here is the minister responsible and you expect a bit of heavyweight punching power. She went on to tell people what it was that she was going to provide as this personal commitment. She said, `I'll help in any way I can with letters of support, telephone calls, visits or whatever is required.' Now there is some hard&hyphen;hitting policy development for you! The Minister for Defence Industry has said, `I'll do anything I can to help you. I'll write letters. I'll make phone calls.' The fact of life is that she is a standing joke in the defence industry community. The pity of it is that defence industry policy has gone down the drain in the same way general industry policy has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That really is a major problem and it can be glossed over, but the government has abandoned the defence industry systems that were put in place. Indeed, DER recommends that things like the defence industry development program be abolished. The government is going to do those things. It is going to take away the small measure of support that was there. There are success stories out of the DID program and, of course, there are failures. Any investment of that kind is going to reap failures as well as successes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that, in a process of looking at dollars and having no concept of where we are heading with defence, these decisions have been taken which are harmful and destructive to defence industry. Defence industry is critical to defence capability, and the minister and the government will say that. Unfortunately, they have done nothing to substantiate those words. Worse, they have stripped away measures that were in place before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend to the minister the opposition's policy on heavy engineering and shipbuilding, which I am sure he has. By all means steal ours, but do something to help defence industry so that we are not left with a situation where, as well as having to rebuild the defence forces when we get re&hyphen;elected next time, we will have to rebuild defence industry as well.</PARA></SPEECH>

I know that, prior to discussing the enhanced arrangements that we finally concluded with the Americans, there were a number of things on the table.

But when we looked at what sort of enhanced arrangements we might make with the Americans, we certainly did discuss them with our senior regional neighbours beforehand, and I have said that publicly before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the stories that were put about by some people in the press at that time, and since, about our neighbours being worried, are nonsense.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The stories that are being put about now by some of the press that some of our regional neighbours are worried about these enhanced arrangements is nonsense because our neighbours are not worried. They have not said they were worried, and they were not worried before those arrangements were made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me to say something about our major northern regional neighbour, and that is China. As I reported in the parliament the other day, there have been certain meetings taking place in recent times. The CDF was up there last year. We have had the chief of the air force up there. We have had the VCDF up there recently, and Hugh White, as you said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely no doubt that we had some difficulties with the Chinese last year, and they had some difficulties with us, but we have talked those over in some depth. Some of those difficulties arose out of the Taiwan issue, some of them arose out of matters to do with the Dalai Lama, and there were others. We have spoken to the ambassador and other Chinese officials, and the Prime Minister has discussed those matters also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have now come to a settled series of arrangements where the Chinese have no difficulty with Australia's relations with the US and they do not see Australia's enhanced arrangements with the US as being directed against China. That is their view and that has been their view, even though we have had some differences in the past with the Chinese. That is the nature of relationships between peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will need to continue talking, as I cannot possibly address the mishmash of subjects that the shadow minister addressed. There seemed, in many cases, to be no logic to his points and I do not intend to spend much time addressing them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> I will, however, address one or two of his points. Firstly, I noticed that the shadow minister threw up this matter of the sale of some facilities. He knows very well that the Defence Efficiency
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5703"> Review suggested an extra 33 properties or so that were not on the Labor Party's list. These sorts of lists&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the Labor Party sold 70&hyphen;odd properties in the last four or five years for $180 million. These lists amount to further sales of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of defence properties. He also knows that with the DER those extra 30&hyphen;odd properties would come up for evaluation in the same way as every one of these properties on your lists were evaluated for possible sale or to be kept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the shadow minister rushes around the country saying, `I am prepared to sign a document that we will not sell Richmond,' does he mean the same document that the Labor Party would have been prepared to sign when it said it would not sell government instrumentalities such as Qantas and TAA and the rest of them? It would have to be an enhanced document. It would have to have gold edges around it. Quite frankly, the fact of the matter is that nobody would believe you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister knows very well that it is our responsibility to evaluate very cautiously all the facilities we own. You can bet your boots that in 100 years time most of the facilities we have now will either be changed, sold, revamped or whatever. In each of those cases there will be a local problem and there will be local political capital made of it on one side or another. Nevertheless, it is our obligation to carefully evaluate them, along with the local councils and the local people and so forth. I have no doubt that there will be some political involvement in every one of those facilities when those occasions arise&mdash;if they ever do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that Smithfield, Salisbury and Elizabeth North in South Australia are on Labor's list. In other words, some of the major facilities were on that list&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to Holsworthy, the final environmental report has still not come down. When it does, we will evaluate it, but I must say that, in the process of having a preliminary look at Holsworthy and Badgerys Creek, when we went to Badgerys Creek we found that absolutely nothing had happened there in the previous 18 months. What was the previous government's second Sydney airport? There was no proposal. It was going to be&mdash;and was&mdash;allowed to drift through that election. It would have been interesting, if Labor had been lucky enough to win the election, to see how it would have let it drift through to the next election. Quite frankly, nothing was going to happen at all, as you well know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we took over the portfolio of Defence we found that we were right at the bottom of the budgetary expenditure that could hold the capabilities of the Australian defence forces where they were.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5704"> strategic reviews. How could you go X years between one review and then suddenly have to revamp the whole thing to have another review? That matter ought to be dynamic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I get the strategic review, and make the public version&mdash;which, as I have said publicly a number of times, will happen&mdash;we will need to have a version which will be different obviously from the original. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS>  We make no apologies for that; it has ever been thus. But I would have to say that I will be insisting, while I have this job, that that strategic review is dynamically upgraded all the time. I do not want to be looking back to a situation and saying, `Isn't it a funny thing? For the last five years we have been ordering all this equipment and doing all these things, but suddenly we have found that the game has changed halfway through.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same thing applies in regard to the Defence reform program. There is no doubt that there will be some pain&mdash;we have said this plenty of times publicly. But we have tried to make the structure of the organisation and the system itself much more efficient. If that is successful, then that system will have some dynamism to it and, in itself, as in business, it will have the capacity to make change from within. People criticise me for equating this situation with business because it is not quite the same, but there are a lot of principles that are the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the shadow minister criticised me for going and getting some outsiders. But he knows very well that 30 or 40 of the people in the secretariat were all from Defence, or were Defence civilians, and those people were really the contributors to most of the changes&mdash;those people and the 200 to 300 people who made submissions one way or another. The fact that we got some outsiders was absolutely essential, I felt, because you cannot make radical change totally from within. You must have both the insiders and some outsiders evaluating those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although this is reasonably radical, we really had no alternative. I have had a lot of people from the middle ranks come to me and say, `About time. We had to do this.' We had $10 billion in 1996 dollars and no further money for at least two or three years. We had to ensure that we could make changes in our acquisitions and keep up. Quite frankly, making these changes will only enable us to keep up, in my view. We have some major decisions to make, as the shadow minister knows, in regard to major platform decisions&mdash;not necessarily acquiring&mdash;because these lead times are so very great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also made the comment about the army being down to 20,000. My figures show that the army was down because national service was in place in the early days and it was down to those figures in the early 1960s. Every military organisation in the world is cutting its numbers. Why are the numbers being cut? Firstly, it is a matter of expense but, secondly, the platforms are getting very sophisticated and expensive and they are being operated by fewer people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is exactly the same as making motor cars or driving caterpillar tractors. The military is no different. One man with the right equipment around him, whether it is for making holes in the air, or whether it is in the army or the navy, is doing far more because of the sophistication and the cost of the equipment that he has got. That cost enables that sophistication and capability. So, it is not a possibility under these sorts of budgetary restraints to be able to do everything. If we are going to have soldiers kitted out with the sorts of communications and abilities that we see today, they are extraordinarily more expensive than a soldier 20 years ago. Numbers are not the answer. Capability and readiness is what we are aiming for.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot possibly address all the areas. I am quite happy to have a debate anywhere or in any parliament that the shadow minister happens to be in, if they let him stay.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many commendable aspects of the veterans' affairs portfolio. Indisputably, this area&mdash;like areas such as immigration until more recent times, when the Prime Minister decided to run shotgun on that portfolio&mdash;has had a large degree of bipartisanship. We certainly recognise commendable aspects of this budget: medication management, the look at compliance packaging, the attempt to reduce the problems for people with memory lapses and eyesight problems&mdash;at the same time, it is not only altruism, with savings of $20 million in the government's predictions over the next four years&mdash;and the extension of disability pension to another 10,500 people and also some service pension and defence service home extensions to a small number.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have indicated in many speeches in RSL conferences around the country and in correspondence with constituents, commendable aspects of the budget include also the continuation of Their Service&mdash;Our Heritage, and equally the minister's emphasis&mdash;understandable, I would think, from his background&mdash;on rural and remote areas, in regard to information delivery and information on home safety and security measures, et cetera. But I should say that, at the same time, this causes me concern, parallel with Medicare offices throughout this country. We find some country seats with three and four offices, conveniently, but many in urban New South Wales and suburban electorates, where Mr Deputy Speaker and I reside, are totally without Medicare offices in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the provision for rural and remote areas; we recognise the significant numbers of veterans in those areas and the difficulties that they have because of distance, et cetera, and perhaps, to some degree, the lack of information. We support these gestures&mdash;the linking of this with state and federal departments&mdash;but we want to be very certain that we do not see, as a consequence of this, a shift in resources long term within the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further with regard to resources, we see that the average staff numbers for the portfolio in the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year will be cut by 610 from 3,406. That includes a reduction of 275 positions as a direct result of the government's imposition on the portfolio of an efficiency dividend of 14.3 per cent over three years. Once again, there has been a long&hyphen;term commitment on both sides of politics that there should be service delivery by a separate entity, by a separate department. One has to question the critical mass of this department long term, with these kinds of reductions in the number of employees in the department, and to question, considering the aging of Australia's population, and more particularly veterans, whether that is going to be a defensible position in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The secretary to the department, Dr Johnston, told the Senate estimates hearing on 12 June, at page 329 of the transcript, that because of the combined effect of a number of changes instituted by the department the staff could be reduced `by up to 30 per cent over the next three years'. He said, furthermore:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we need to identify areas where we can contract out some more of our business . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a very distinct possibility that there are going to be longer term questions for the level, quantity, extent and timeliness of the service provided to veterans posed by these kinds of reductions. They are significant, they are noticeable. It is all right to go around assuring various conferences that you believe in this department, you believe these are a distinct part
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5706"> of the welfare community in this country, they have particular needs, they have a particular need for services. But if you have a situation where these kind of reductions are occurring, then there must be some concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reason that there must be increasing questions as to bipartisanship in this field is the interaction of this department with a number of others. It is no good going around and simply telling people, `We are going to give this much for the south Goulburn memorial,' or, `We are going to do this in Roma,' and so on, when we see that there are very noticeable changes in the Department of Social Security, changes that are going to impact directly on veterans. We saw a significant number of those in aged care in regard to income support in this country. The veteran community in this country does want to see the minister in there fighting and taking on the Social Security and Treasury direction that is dominating decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the long term, as we look at this portfolio, it cannot be just distinguished to one side by a fixation with commemorative activities and belief that in the long term that is going to simply impress veterans as being the ant's pants of the whole portfolio. There is a concern about what is happening throughout the portfolio, and the impact of other portfolios upon it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996, we saw $1.26 billion slashed from social security over a two&hyphen;year period in this country. Again in this budget of far less strenuous reductions, the fact of life in 1997 is that after two budgets there are cuts of $1.16 billion over three years. They are obviously having a very big impact upon the constituency of this minister and upon the people that he is representing. The opposition, veterans and older people in this country are not a collection of Man Fridays finding Robinson Crusoes in regard to this particular budget. It is not one off; it is not the only budget in which there have been failures to defend standards and conditions in the portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year we saw the government, with the simple intention of victimising a mere 340 people in this country and saving $21,000 over a four&hyphen;year period, change the rental assistance for single people within this particular department. We saw the introduction of user charges in HACC or home care and there have been arguments that veterans are particularly discriminated against because of a lack of recognition by state authorities that they are actually responsible for these people and they are not just shoved totally into the control of veterans' affairs. Last year saw earning credits altered and obviously changes in deeming. When we come to this particular budget, it is not a one&hyphen;off situation. It is not a one&hyphen;off instance of deterioration of people's rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn to some of the aspects of this particular budget. One measure involves saving $15.5 million over four years and relates to various panels for diagnosis. I want to put on the record some of the comments made by the Vietnam Veterans' Association. Quite obviously they have deeper concerns about this, because they have a view&mdash;and it has been articulated by departmental representatives as well&mdash;that PTSD is the main target of the government. There have been throwaway lines about back problems and other things, but the diagnosis of this condition is one which does seem to be the government's thrust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Vietnam Veterans' Association reminded me that even the Agent Orange royal commission stated in 1985:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result is that approximately one quarter of Vietnam veterans can be expected to be in need of psychological or psychiatric help. . .
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5707">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Furthermore, the 1992&hyphen;93 Auditor&hyphen;General's report is apparently argued as being a very distinct and very influential reason as to why the government is attacking the rights of these veterans in regard to their compensation. This is the document which is the seminal driving force behind the change to smash these people's conditions and&mdash;as has been said by the department&mdash;deprive five per cent of people of their compensation, that is, 150 of the 30,000 applicants every year who are supposedly the target of this change. This not very sympathetic report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is generally recognised by experts that the background prevalence of PTSD for Vietnam veterans is quite high&mdash;the ANOA's consultants suggest it is perhaps 30% of all veterans. . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Furthermore, they put the point that PTSD is not the only psychiatric problem facing Vietnam veterans. In fact, they state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statistics from 1993 to 1997 show that some 40% of psychiatric conditions accepted as war caused by the Repatriation system were conditions other than PTSD.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They further indicate that a particular study of 84 members of the D company&mdash;of whom only 30 per cent were at the battle of Long Tan&mdash;found that nearly 30 per cent had full blown PTSD, whilst a further 55 per cent suffered some of the list of symptoms associated with it&mdash;a total of 85 per cent with war caused psychological damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is a variety of government reports&mdash;most of them unsympathetic, most of them critical and most of them driven by the attempt to reduce government expenditure&mdash;saying that this is a very real problem for Vietnam veterans. What we are seeing as part of this budget process is an attempt by the government to make a major change in regard to panel diagnosis under the pretext or veneer of a whole lot of veterans trying to be corrupt, undermine or steal money from the government. As I say, they have a variety of suggestions as to how they are going to cut this down. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, from personal analysis by people who are immediately connected with these particular Vietnam veterans, the veterans have said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That more and more are hitting the wall is not surprising either. We are reaching the age where our youthful energy is deserting us. Before, we could suppress our ailments and `soldier on'. Now the youngest of us is close to 50. We can't pretend we are not sick any more. We have to face ourselves and admit we are crook, even though we'd like to deny it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So in all of the plaudits, in all of the aspects of this budget that we do find commendable, that we are happy with and where we feel the minister is putting up what should occur, this is one area where there must be grave concerns about the thrust of government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Vietnam veterans have stated their view that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Veterans should not have to personally face a reviewing tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They also state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Accreditation schemes have the danger of appearing like the Repatriation Commission simply picking psychiatrists it thinks will be tough on veterans and allowing only them to diagnose psychiatric conditions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They further state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. The introduction of any new system for the diagnosis of war caused psychiatric conditions must not be accompanied by the restriction of appeal rights to the appeals board or tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We know that there are a variety of thoughts with regard to the future direction of those tribunals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5708">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is occurring there is, on all appearances, a very reasonable concern that this is a significant assault. The government might say at this stage that it is only 150. But, quite frankly, I think a number of service organisations, the opposition and the general public have to be vigilant because  this might be one of the few areas where the government is understating for the next few years what it expects to accomplish from this. It does seem a very interesting facet that to tackle only 150 cases that they supposedly claim are sham, corrupt or improper over that period of time needs this kind of emphasis from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other aspects of the budget. One that has been raised very strongly, both in this portfolio and in Social Security, is the question of the government's changes with regard to pharmaceuticals. From recollection, the figure is $39 million in savings over the next four years. This interfaces with the health department and it is interesting to note that, a year ago, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) said, `The new drugs are actually better and I would like to have Australians having access to the best and newest drugs.' He would like them to get access, but the fact of life is that in 1997, in this budget which this minister is part of, there is a very significant attempt to essentially reduce the ability of people to get access when they cannot afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, Dr Johnston, told the Senate estimates committee last week that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I would be misleading you if I did not indicate that there is an expectation that treating doctors will be a bit more questioning in the prescription of some of these treatments and will not proceed with that in all cases.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Assurances by the minister that, really, this is going to have a minimal impact are deflated, undermined, criticised and basically ridiculed by the comments of the secretary of the department that there is going to be a fundamental impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the budget papers there is a figure of $39 million over four years, so to say that it is not going to have an impact, that it is not going to hurt people and, at the same time, to be recouping and saving that kind of money really does raise very significant questions. Both the delisting of these medicines and the therapeutic group premiums will have a significant impact on the portfolio. The opposition have indicated that they have concerns about these, as have service organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of what is occurring with peoples' rights and with the panel diagnosis is interrelated with another part of government policy. That is, the way in which other departments are eroding peoples' rights to actually take on departments, including this department, and this government. Amongst those changes has been a very strong attack on legal aid. There is also the question of the Human Rights and Equal Commission. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only do we have the question of what they are doing on the pharmaceuticals front, but we also have the question of what the impact of aged care changes is on a population that is significantly present amongst older Australians, that is, the veterans community. The figures show that 78,000 of Australia's 97,000 war widows are aged over 70 years of age, and that is 85 per cent of them. Aged care impacts upon this particular portfolio. One has to question how strenuously, how rigorously, the minister took on these kinds of issues within the government because they are having a very real impact upon the people who are covered by this department.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5709">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People's conditions are being eroded whether it is to do with therapeutic changes, aged care, appeal rights, or whether it is in regards to diagnosis. People's conditions are being very rudely impacted upon by changes such as access to legal aid and in areas such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note the comments of the organisation People With Disabilities (NSW) Inc. In commenting on those changes they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PWD rejects the Attorney&hyphen;General's attempt to rationalise and sanitise these cuts. The cuts are patently not equivalent to the 4% efficiency savings applied to other agencies within the Attorney's portfolio: the cuts to HREOC are obviously almost eleven times greater than cuts applied elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .. PWD genuinely believes that the cuts are motivated by an unstated policy of the Government to dismantle these structures which protect the rights and interests of vulnerable minorities with in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They mention:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an unprecedented deterioration in the social fabric of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have had service groups come to me expressing their concern at the assault on legal aid under the technicality of the improper payment of money for cases that are state and not federal, et cetera. There is this Human Rights and Equal Opportunity thing. The Ombudsman's office is being undermined. All of these things are impacting directly upon veterans in this country. Even if the minister thinks this is irrelevant, not connected, not of importance, not relevant to this portfolio, they are certainly matters which people feel are impacting upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, there is, and there always will be in this portfolio, a variety of aspects upon which any opposition of the day will be in agreement with because there is this tradition in regards to income support and in regards to commemorative activities that there will be a degree of commonality of policy in this area. But there has been a failure to draw the line on eroding conditions in areas such as pharmaceuticals, aged care and deeming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are single veterans, believe it or not. They are not all conventionally married 70&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. There are single veterans who live in the same house who have been hit by rental changes. These things are significant. They do impact on this portfolio. They are not totally separated. They are not isolated. They are not irrelevant. On these matters, the opposition does have grave concerns.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to use this opportunity to raise with the minister the matter of the exclusion from eligibility for repatriation benefits of members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in what was then Malaya in the period 1955 to 1960. In doing that, I think it is a matter that previous governments of both shades ought to have addressed but did not, regrettably. Nonetheless, it seems to me that is not an adequate reason for this government to not now address this particular issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1955, the Menzies government committed Australian defence forces from the three services to the Malayan emergency. I understand that the Repatriation (Far East Strategic Reserve) Act 1956 specifically excluded members of the Navy from eligibility for repatriation benefits. That was particularly ironic at a time when HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anzac</EMPHASIS> and HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS> were both involved in bombardments of enemy positions in Malaya. Later that year HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queenborough</EMPHASIS> and HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quickmatch </EMPHASIS>were similarly engaged. The Australian Navy was a component of the Order of Battle for Malaya and was part of the Royal Naval Far East Fleet during that emergency.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of historians have dealt with this matter. Lieutenant Colonel N.C. Smith in a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mostly Unsung</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to the arrival of the RAN ships the available Navy force had been barely adequate, with little or no capacity for refitting or a meaningful presence on both the east and west coast.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Another historian, Brigadier E.D. Smith, in a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Counter&hyphen;Insurgency Operations: 1 Malaya and Borneo</EMPHASIS>  said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other reason that so few arms of any significance were brought into the country was due to the constant but unspectacular blockade exerted by the Royal Navy's Coastal patrols [which included RAN ships] and RAAF flying boat patrols.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These agencies maintained the territorial detachment of Malaya from the outer world because a series of random searches at sea served to act as a powerful deterrent to would&hyphen;be gun runners. The Royal Navy's part</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[which included RAN ships] in ensuring that the [enemy] received little of value by sea was one that was taken for granted by the Malayan people and the land forces defending them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is quite clear that the RAN performed a valuable role. Apart from bombardment of shore positions, they were obviously involved with signals intercept. That was found by the historians to have played a very significant role in that particular conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the Full Federal Court in 1966 held, when some matters relating to the question of active service were tested, that the expression `in actual combat against the enemy' included conduct which answered the description of `integral participation in an activity directly intended for an encounter with the enemy, whether offensive or defensive in character'. I submit that, and veterans from that time submit, all RAN ships were involved in operations that clearly meet that category. They feel most aggrieved that they continue to be excluded, almost uniquely, I think, from consideration for eligibility for repatriation benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter I wish to raise also relates to anomalies in relation to the treatment of veterans. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), shortly before the election, made a commitment that a major initiative of the coalition was the military medals policy. This policy standardises and considerably widens the eligibility of ex&hyphen;service personnel to receive an Australian services medal. That position was supported by the then coalition spokesperson on veterans' affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September last year, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) issued a press release following an address to the RSL national congress. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to announce that the Government's policy is largely in place with the Governor&hyphen;General having already approved changes to the determinations for the medals under his authority; Her Majesty's assent is being sought for these changes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 28 May this year the Minister was forced to concede that the coalition had in fact not honoured its commitment to those who served in Korea, in the Malayan emergency and in the Indonesian confrontation. Eight months after she said that everything was in order she was conceding that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was indeed then discovered that those people had been awarded an Imperial Medal at the behest of the Australian Government, and therefore it was an Australian medal rendered in respect of that active service in Korea, in the Malayan emergency and in the Indonesian confrontation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, can I thank the shadow minister and the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) for their contributions to this debate. It is certainly pleasing to see members of the opposition taking an interest in the Veterans' Affairs portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I just say at the outset that we often get calls that we are not doing enough for veterans. That is so for both sides of the parliament as the opposition did so when in government. I just remind us all in this committee here this morning that we do appropriate almost $6.4 billion to care for our veteran community, our war widows and some dependants of veterans. It is important that we do focus on that fact from time to time. The government does see this very much as a bipartisan portfolio and we do give thanks for the shadow minister's comments in that area as well as some areas that he has flagged that he has some concerns in. It is important that we do acknowledge that all governments have tried as hard as they can to make sure they meet as many of the needs of our veteran community as possible. Given the constraints of budgets from time to time, it is not possible to extend some areas as far as perhaps we would like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just touch on the issue of some outsourcing that has been going on in the department. The shadow minister raised this issue and referred to some of the comments by the secretary in Senate estimates. I would remind the opposition, when they look at this outsourcing, of the numbers of staff that were in the department when they came to government. Admittedly, at the time they came to government, the ownership of all repatriation hospitals was with the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During their time in government, we saw the staff of the Department of Veterans' Affairs fall from something like 13,000 down to 3,400 or thereabouts. The large numbers of reductions in staffing certainly were associated with the privatisation of those repatriation hospitals which we in opposition supported. I would remind the opposition, when they talk about the outsourcing of some activities of the department today, to just look at what they did when they were in government. I also remind them that we supported them in that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we do look at the efficiency of the department, as you should look at the efficiency of government. Also, I am sure every business person in this nation would be aware of the need to look at the efficiency of their business operation. Through running an efficient department and making savings, we have been able to deliver in this budget an extension of benefits to veterans who were not previously entitled to them. I will refer to a couple of those.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We picked up 11 other areas of anomalies. I will just read these for the benefit of the member. They include <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMAS Vampire</EMPHASIS>  and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMAS Quickmatch</EMPHASIS>  in relation to service in Vietnam prior to 1962. We also picked up the embassy guard with the Australian embassy in Saigon after our withdrawal there. We picked up the naval service people that you refer to. We have picked up the BCOF people&mdash;the British occupation forces in Japan. We have picked up 12 other areas of anomalies that were previously not acknowledged as service. That needs to be acknowledged and recognised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people will be eligible for a disability payment through the Department of Veterans' Affairs. They will also be eligible for health treatment for war related injuries that may have been inflicted during that service in those previously unrecognised areas of service. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> I will now deal with the area of panel diagnosis that was touched on by the shadow minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure him that on this issue there will be no throwaway lines from this minister and, I would hope, from anyone in the parliament, because it is a very serious issue and one that is acknowledged by us and has been acknowledged by previous ministers and by previous governments. It is a serious issue. We want to make sure that, through a better approach to this, we can have confidence in the diagnosis of the psychological disorder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members may not be aware, but last year we brought Professor Arieh Shalev out here from Israel. He is a world renowned expert in the area of diagnosis of PTSD. He spoke at conferences all around this nation, including to our serving defence forces. Currently, we are circulating an options paper. We are having discussions with the ex&hyphen;service community, including the Vietnam Veterans' Association of Australia and the Vietnam Veterans' Federation of Australia. We are working very closely with them. This options paper will be circulated before any final process is agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from rushing into this issue, we have identified that we need to have confidence in the process. Veterans themselves want to have confidence in the diagnosis. I think there are as many who do not get diagnosed with PTSD who feel they should, as there are those who do get diagnosed. We need to make sure that we all have confidence in the diagnostic process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also point out that we have very real concerns about the health of Vietnam veterans. We have acknowledged that with the release of the mortality study of Vietnam veterans. Only recently, we circulated a questionnaire on health to over 53,000 Vietnam veterans around Australia. That questionnaire was drawn up with the help of Vietnam veterans' associations. It includes questions about their lifestyle, their children and their relationship within their marriage. It is an important questionnaire, and it is a further demonstration of our commitment to assist Vietnam veterans, to make sure that we are targeting their needs as well as possible and that we are not leaving them feeling left out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out that, for the very first time, we will be asking female veterans who served in Vietnam in any capacity, for one day or more from 1962 to 1973&mdash;and we have identified 484 of them&mdash;to also participate in that questionnaire. I hope that wherever they go members
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5713"> of the opposition continue to urge Vietnam veterans to fill out that questionnaire&mdash;they have until 30 June to complete it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Veterans' Review Board and the appeal process, let me assure the shadow minister and the opposition that we take our responsibility in this area very seriously. Our appointment of Brigadier Bill Rolfe to the principal member's position on the Veterans' Review Board shows our commitment to putting people in the position who understand the culture of the people for whom they have responsibility in relation to reviews of claims that have been rejected by the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Brigadier Bill Rolfe was a Vietnam veteran who served back here in Australia after his service in Vietnam. I will remind people that, as a soldier in Vietnam, he was wounded and lost both legs. If ever there was anyone who could understand the culture of Vietnam veterans, it would be Brigadier Rolfe. His appointment is another demonstration that, when it comes to dealing with veterans issues, we are serious about having people who understand the people for whom they have responsibility in terms of those processes of review.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst we all acknowledge that perhaps, in some of these areas, we would all like to go further from time to time, I would remind those on the other side of the House that they had 13 years to look at this one, so I would ask that you look at this issue in a bipartisan way. We have picked them up for any disability that may have been caused as a result of that service, and they will receive a disability pension for any disabilities that they identify as resulting from that service. They will also be eligible for health treatment in relation to those disabilities or war&hyphen;caused injuries. They will not be eligible, though, for a service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If those people are, in fact, on a social security pension, they may well be eligible for the `bring them back' program by which we are trying to bring those on a part disability pension

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak very briefly on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98 with respect to the Department of Transport and Regional Development, primarily because there is very little of great consequence in this current budget with respect to transport&mdash;so much so that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development was able to put out only two press releases as a result of the transport decisions in the budget. I will deal in brief detail with the issues that the two press releases dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, on the question of roads, in the budget of last year the government cut $622 million from the forward estimates for the national highway over the four years of that budgetary year and the three subsequent forward estimates years. Yet again, in the current budget, we have seen reductions, albeit slight, in overall road funding. The major savage decisions were made last year; they have been continued this year and, indeed, slightly exacerbated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is noteworthy also that particular states, such as Queensland and Victoria, appear to be bearing the brunt of the reduction in road funding that has occurred. In my state of Victoria, for example, throughout the entirety of the 1990s up to last year Victoria received between 20 and 21 per cent of total federal road funding. That percentage went down to something like 17.9 per cent in last year's budget, and in this year's budget it is declining even further, to 15.9 per cent. Similar patterns can be seen with respect to road funding in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also notable in this year's budget that the proportion of funds going to the roads of national importance category&mdash;or, as I call it, the roads of National Party importance category&mdash;has increased again, at the cost of the national highway. In Labor's last budget, the national highway had an allocation of $834 million. That is a figure that was roughly similar, in real terms, across almost all of the time when Labor was in government. In this budget the national highway allocation is $697 million; there has been a very substantial drop from the $834 million in the 1995 budget to the $697 million in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that there is $112 million allocated for roads of national importance but, by definition, that will not go to the national highway. It will go elsewhere, based on highly dubious and, I suggest, very open&hyphen;ended criteria which are designed ultimately to allow all sorts of pork&hyphen;barrelling on the part of the minister to occur and are already, effectively, being used for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the second issue on which the minister managed to get a press release out. His press release with respect to roads did not exactly tell us the true story about what has been happening with road funding over the past 15 months, and similarly his press release with respect to the national rail infrastructure authority or the track authority, which we have just been debating in the main chamber this morning, was a little less than forthcoming.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5715">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government proposed to spend $370 million over five years to allow the then Track Australia to own and operate the interstate track and to maintain the interstate track in Australia&mdash;a very important infrastructure investment and micro&hyphen;economic reform. In last year's budget this decision was continued but cut from $370 million to roughly $245 million, I think, from memory. This time around, the minister has announced that the amount that will be spent will be a mere $175 million. His press release said $175 million; the budget papers, at table 12.4, I think, from memory, said that the figure would be $185 million. I am not even quite sure that he can get the figure right. He thinks he cut it by $10 million more than he actually did, by the look of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, the minister tried to turn a cut, a vice, into a virtue by putting out a press release announcing&mdash;yet again&mdash;something that the former government had announced, something that his government had announced and something that was being announced in the context of substantial reductions in funding. He was trying to pretend that this was a wonderful decision for the rail industry and transport in Australia, when in fact it is a terrible decision. It is something that I think anybody who has got any association with the rail industry&mdash;users, workers and communities that depend on the rail industry&mdash;will live to regret. They will regret that this substantial reduction in the level of investment that goes into maintaining and upgrading the track, which is of particular importance in many areas such as the Brisbane to Melbourne and Melbourne to Adelaide sections of the interstate track, is occurring; that the process of negotiating with the states to develop the authority appears to have stalled; and that the minister is trying on this very day to get a bill through the parliament which will give him the power to make all the decisions with respect to the future track authority without any future reference to the parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately I missed the early part of the shadow minister's contribution, but no doubt he took the opportunity to remind the parliament that, in its first budget, the Howard government cut $622 million from the national highway budget over four years. Again, in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget, it copped another slug. So where does it leave the national highway program, when the former Labor government was only spending about $840 million each year: $622 million over four years, and we were only spending about $840 million? That gives you a very clear indication of the significance of that slug. As a result, national highway projects right around the country have ground to a halt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk specifically about one of those projects, a project known as the Kurri Corridor, a project which would provide a link between the F3 freeway and the New England Highway just north of Branxton in my electorate, a corridor that would have enormous economic benefits for the Hunter generally and, in particular, the Upper Hunter. The link would bring those communities in the Upper Hunter just that much closer to Sydney and all of its markets and, of course, to the port of Newcastle.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5716"> enormous economic benefits to the valley, it would have overcome some very significant problems experienced by both the Cessnock and Maitland and, indeed, Newcastle councils.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to focus specifically on Cessnock's problems. The main roads through Cessnock are providing a short cut between the F3 freeway and the New England Highway for about 400 trucks each day. Those 400 trucks daily stream through Cessnock's central business district. This is a local economy in difficulty. Coalmining has in a sense moved on and our economic base is shrinking.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8K6">Mr FITZGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are not doing much to help it. Cessnock has some economic difficulties. The council wants to do something about that. It wants to start by refurbishing the central business district but it cannot make a move while ever that main street is accommodating 400 heavy vehicles each day. The Kurri Corridor would have fixed that problem but now there seems little hope that it will ever be constructed. A change of government, of course, might help.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Cessnock council is looking at some alternatives. It has now undertaken a study into a simple bypass of the town, a $33 million project which would effectively take those heavy vehicles out of Cessnock's central business district and out of those roads such as Allandale Road and Aberdare Road which house a number of residents. Of course, this thing has to be funded. We should not fear because the present Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp)&mdash;or should I say just `Transport' since his statement that the Commonwealth has no role to play in the area of regional development&mdash;when he was shadow minister, visited Cessnock and spoke with Cessnock council and the National Party candidate about their concerns. What did he say? `You need not fear. We will have a fund in government known as roads of national importance'&mdash;or significance&mdash;`and this looks like a project which could quite neatly fit into such a scheme.' That is what he had to say before the election but we have not heard from him since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what are Cessnock council's options? It is now asking the state government to fund the project; as I said, it is some $33 million. You know, Mr Deputy Speaker, how difficult it is to get that sort of money out of a state government for a road project. The council will be visiting the minister, the now minister, to ask him to meet his commitment from prior to the election, but I fear that they have very little hope. I cannot see them spending $33 million&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the most disturbing things to have occurred during the life of this parliament is the demise of regional development as a serious portfolio responsibility of the government. Regional development is paid lip&hyphen;service. It was given very uneven attention by the previous government, I might say, although at the very end of its term Labor seemed to get things right in at least one area with the creation of the RDOs, those regional development organisations which, finally, after years of similar bodies, state and federal, with overlapping responsibilities and no real purpose, seemed to have the right formula. The personnel was right, the plans were in place, and the expectations were credible. What did this government do? It eliminated RDOs because of the Labor taint and it eliminated in all but name the Department of Regional Development&mdash;and this from a senior National Party minister. No wonder the people in the bush are scratching their heads in bewilderment and looking elsewhere to put their votes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5717">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most cynical exercises was this government's complete rejection&mdash;having promised to support it&mdash;of the feasibility study into Parkes export airport. I mentioned this in more detail in my response in relation to primary industry expenditure last night. Western New South Wales feels rejected by the government's walking away from a miserly $250,000 commitment to a project that looks like coming up trumps, despite the government's lack of interest and, I might say, lack of vision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the funding for a national rail infrastructure, but I wonder if it will benefit the main western rail line through New South Wales, Bathurst, Parkes and Broken Hill. That infrastructure needs urgent attention to take advantage of the natural advantages, the rail freight facilities at Bathurst, Blayney and Parkes, combined with the north&hyphen;south Newell Highway road intersection office. As well, by encouraging heavy freight onto rail, and hub and spoking smaller loads from depots, such as Bathurst, Blayney and Parkes, the load is taken off both the highways and the highway budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One hundred and seventy&hyphen;five million dollars over four years is fine, but far more will be needed if we are serious about rail regaining and exploiting its potential to save money. It is rational economics&mdash;the cost of not having heavy and hazardous freight on rail. The impact of that is there for everyone to see at the moment: the risk of accidents; the breaking up of road surfaces; and the struggle by local government to meet its road commitments, especially with its FAGs, those federal assistance grants, cut by 1.2 per cent in real per capita terms in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, too, to note the concern now being expressed by local governments and states about the impact of changes in load allowances. The air suspension on the new generation of trucks is being regarded with grave suspicion, with data showing bridge damage likely to be substantial from the double&hyphen;B era of vehicles. I suspect that the $11 million set aside for a national survey of bridge requirements might turn up some interesting data. While this government supports increased mass weights on vehicles on the premise that it will mean fewer vehicles, the so&hyphen;called road friendly suspensions may not, according to my information, be so friendly after all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when the west of New South Wales is crying out for support, it seems that this government, as did the one before&mdash;except on the Mount Lambie section, and then only after extreme public pressure led by the Highway Safety Action Group&mdash;will continue to disregard the claims of the Great Western Highway for national highway status. Coalition members across the mountain should hang their heads in shame, if they are not pushing for this status. Not only is it a major tourist link through their districts to the historical goldfields and other attractions of the central west, but also it is a main artery, feeding traffic to and from the west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With increased loads, both in size and frequency, of timber and farm produce and other items travelling the route, this link is a potential social, physical and economic disaster. Its accident record is worse than that along the Pacific Highway. The absence of any commitment to the western rail line is hampering growth and decentralisation. I realise that we are a vast country with a huge demand on the $697 million road budget. But smart spending on an integrated rail and highway transport system should include the main western rail line and the Great Western Highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke last night about the work for the dole scheme, and how the government might investigate a farmhand scheme with a proper training component and award wages. Around 50 schemes in regional Australia covering 10,000 people is not enough to soak up even a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5718"> fraction of the 30 per cent plus of young rural people who are unemployed, not forgetting the middle&hyphen;aged unemployed. Without any major job creation program and with only this token attempt to address the real unemployment problem, exacerbated by the penalties of the new youth allowance, this government is either totally ignorant of the real situation of rural Australia, or so hell&hyphen;bent on bottom line balancing that it is sorely risking its claim to truly represent regional Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I endorse the comments that were made by the member for Calare in relation to the attitude which this government is taking to the whole question of regional development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is apparent, of course, that the bureaucracy generally would advise governments about the structure of the bureaucracy and the relationship between portfolios. To have a Department of Transport and Regional Development is a very sensible arrangement and a very sensible connection. In July last year, we had the government announcing that the regional development and urban programs within this Department of Transport and Regional Development would be terminated and so the funding was withdrawn. The Department of Transport and Regional Development then in effect became the Department of Transport. The Minister for Transport (Mr Sharp) is quite clearly charged with the responsibility, as Minister for Transport, not to develop transport but to tear away funding, to destroy programs and to sell off the assets. That is the role which the Minister for Transport has been required to adopt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I think there is a great deal of concern in regional Australia about the fact that this government, in effect, has turned its back on it. To a large extent, the government has allowed economic forces to determine the direction in which regional development will go. That simply is not good enough. Governments do have a responsibility for national planning, for determining regional strategies and for acting as a catalyst for the type of development that needs to be undertaken. If you allow, for example, market forces to determine the nature and the direction of regional development in Australia, you can finish up with the type of thing that we are seeing now in places like Geelong and Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Newcastle, for example, I referred to yesterday. BHP has made a decision that the primary steelmaking capacity and facilities in Newcastle will disappear from September 1999. The free marketeers and the economic rationalists might well say that is the way the market is taking us. The point that I emphasis is that that betrays a complete lack of understanding about what regional development and regional economies are all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia we do have very significant identifiable regions. They are integrated and they are coordinated. They operate as regions. Allowing steel, for example, to come out of the Newcastle region or the Hunter region would be like saying, `Here is an engine of a motor car with a bit here that probably is not necessary. We will allow that to be taken out,' and you take out the carburettor. The engine then, of course, stops operating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, that is probably a good example of the essential role which the component elements of regional economies play and the way in which each of them depend on other sections of it. What we need is a national government which is prepared to provide leadership in questions of national development. National development takes place as a result of the coordinated and the integrated development of each of those regions and the contribution which in turn each of them make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had not only a withdrawal of funding from regional development in Australia by this government, but positive attacks by this government on regional Australia. Some of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5719"> best examples are the wholesale closing of offices and government agencies in the regions of Australia. In the budget of last year there were 11,200 in the public service, many of them in regional Australia, who lost their jobs. This year another 16,500 and in addition to that 8,000 in the defence forces in Australia. As a result of other decisions made by this government another 22,000 telecommunications workers are going to lose their jobs. Many of these are in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has slashed labour market programs. It has replaced all of those significant initiatives, which the previous government had made, with programs and ideas which clearly are identified as gimmicks and continue to be seen as gimmicks by the Australian community. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

I, as much as anyone else, regret that we will no longer make primary steel at Newcastle. That hurts me and I think the honourable member acknowledges that. But to imply that somehow government, through lack of production of infrastructure, or BHP itself, or between the government and BHP, we should continue to make a product unprofitably is just an absolute nonsense. That is not economic rationalism. It would be totally irrational to continue to make products for which you lose money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Charlton, no matter how his sympathies may lie, will have to admit that the communist theory and philosophy, the Marxist theory and philosophy, failed and so the walls came tumbling down. The world, even China, has become enamoured of the free market. No matter how much you might dislike it, nonetheless that is a fact. It is a fact that BHP cannot afford to make a product for which they lose money, as they are doing. A large portion of the product of that mill is exported because there is not enough domestic market. The product out of that mill, the bar and rod and wire, is more expensive than product made by Smorgons in Melbourne or a BHP in Sydney, because those operations use electric arc furnaces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the best of my knowledge&mdash;and I would bet on it&mdash;nobody will ever build another blast furnace in the world. Not one more blast furnace will ever be built. Today, some of the more recent ones are absolutely huge&mdash;I believe, 3.5 million tonnes for one blast furnace. When I grew up on a blast furnace, a million&hyphen;tonne unit was a huge blast furnace, absolutely gigantic. Those expanded themselves, but to build a new furnace at 3.5 million tonnes is just unheard off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that those old furnaces with old technology just cannot compete with a scrap fed electric arc furnace. BHP ain't got the scrap to feed to Newcastle, because Australia's scrap is already consumed by Smorgons, by BHP and by whoever else it is in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not an apologist for BHP; I regret the fact that Newcastle is going to close. I simply make the point to the member for Charlton that you have to make economic decisions based on profits and on losses. It is not the government's fault that the world price for bar and rod has fallen with respect to its price for flat product. Port Kembla is profitable and Port Kembla is expanding. Why? Because it makes flat product, it makes it in modern facilities and those furnaces will run, I hope, for a very long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not economic rationalism per se, nor is it some sort of economic conspiracy against the people of Newcastle. I think all of us have the greatest sympathy for the people of Newcastle.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5720"> I certainly hope that we can find mechanisms to help Newcastle to help itself to attract new industry and new jobs, and build an exciting future that is not dependent on the old steel mill, not dependent on old technology. As much as I regret their losing that culture, I know&mdash;because I am an old steelworker&mdash;that old steelworkers never die. We never forget our steel mills. It is part of our life and part of our culture, and nothing else will ever be the same once they have finished. I thank the member for Charlton for his contribution, but he got that little bit wrong.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When my time expired earlier, I was talking about the government's slashing of the national highway budget and its impact on that system, and in particular about the fact that that will now more than likely cause the Kurri Corridor in my electorate not to be funded. I was talking about the problems that that will cause for the Cessnock area, in particular. I was calling upon the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to make good his commitment prior to the election to fund a bypass of Cessnock under the roads of national importance fund&mdash;if, indeed, he is not going to commit the government to the Kurri Corridor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to ask, Mr Deputy Speaker: where is the minister? Where is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson)? We are talking here about some significant issues and, at the very least, we should have the parliamentary secretary in here. What do we get instead? With the greatest respect to the minister, we get the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) from Queensland, rather than the minister himself or, indeed, the parliamentary secretary. I know that yesterday, Mr Deputy Speaker, either you or one of the other members of the speakers panel passed comment on the fact that ministers were making an effort to get into the Main Committee for these discussions, but it is very unfortunate that the Minister of Transport has not seen fit to do so or even to send his parliamentary secretary up to represent him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to return to Cessnock's road problems. Other members will recall that I was speaking about the 400 heavy vehicles that pass through the town each day. Cessnock Council will be pursuing the federal minister on the issue of his commitment to a bypass, and we hope that they will be meeting with him very soon. But we will also be seeking a commitment from him that the Kurri Corridor will be funded in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn to a short&hyphen;term alternative. Even if the minister funds a bypass of Cessnock tomorrow, it is obviously going to be years before it is constructed and, therefore, the heavy vehicle movement problem in Cessnock is going to remain with us for some time. I myself have described the idea as naive and novel, but it would be wonderful if we could load limit the state road that those heavy vehicles are using. Of course, it is impossible to load limit a state road and, in any case, it would be difficult to differentiate between those trucks that are actually servicing the Cessnock area and those that are using the town only as a short cut to the national highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have recently written to a number of organisations, including the Transport Workers Union, the Road Transport Forum, and the New South Wales Road Haulage Association. I have asked
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5721"> them to do something which is, as I conceded, fairly novel and which may be naive, and that is to simply ask the trucks not to go through Cessnock and not to devastate our local community. They come through Cessnock simply because it saves them seven minutes and 14 kilometres, that is all. It is not a significant amount of time in the scheme of things, when you are talking about haulages from, for example, Melbourne to Brisbane. It is a saving of only seven minutes and 14 kilometres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry is not one which enjoys a great image out in the community, so what a perfect opportunity this would be for it to enhance its image in the community by effectively saving Cessnock. That is what they would be doing: saving Cessnock's economy by allowing the council to get on with the refurbishment of the CBD&mdash;and it would cost them only seven minutes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that, in any case, there are some false economies involved in taking the short cut. They may save seven minutes, but there might be some additional costs to the operator because of the number of stops, right&hyphen;hand turns and acceleration distances et cetera. The reason I raise this is that I think my campaign to have them voluntarily withdraw from Cessnock would be greatly enhanced if the state and federal ministers became involved. I have had good responses from the trade union movement, the Road Transport Forum and the New South Wales Road Haulage Association. They are running some campaigns for me, putting some articles in their industry newsletter, et cetera. But I would like to write to every operator, to every one of those people who own those trucks that are passing through Cessnock as a short cut. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very difficult for me to identify the operators of those trucks, but it could be that 60 per cent of the trucks are owned by only four or five people. It is very difficult for me to identify them, but certainly the state and federal ministers have the resources and the capability to do so. Yesterday I wrote to them both, and I have also contacted the office of Carl Scully, the minister in New South Wales, and had a positive response from his office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I am calling upon the federal minister to at least do something for Cessnock. If he cannot fund the Kurri corridor, if he cannot come good on his pre&hyphen;election commitment to fund a bypass of Cessnock, he can at least help by joining my campaign to simply ask those trucks to voluntarily remove themselves from Cessnock and stick to the national highway. I am confident I will have the state minister's support, because when they leave the national highway to go on to the state road through Cessnock there is effectively a cost shifting from the Commonwealth to the state. I would have thought the state government would have a very strong interest indeed in getting those trucks back on the national highway where they belong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My simple message today to the minister is this: fund the Kurri corridor. If not, fund a bypass of Cessnock, as he committed himself to do prior to the election. But, at the very least, join my campaign to have those trucks voluntarily remove themselves from those Cessnock roads.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise in this debate the recent announcement by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) that the Essendon airport will be privatised, or the lease on that airport sold off. That is a matter of great concern to people in my electorate who live around that airport. In particular, they are concerned that selling off the airport to a private sector operator, and the pressure for profit which will come from that, will lead to pressures to reduce existing protections for residents around the airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5722">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are questions people in Essendon, Strathmore, Pascoe Vale and Oak Park want answered. Firstly, what guarantees will the minister provide that the existing jet curfew, from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., will be retained? It is absolutely essential that that curfew be retained. Secondly, what guarantees will we get that the existing limitations on the size of aircraft which can use Essendon airport will remain in place? We do not want to see those size restrictions changed and the airport revisited with large freight aircraft. Thirdly, we want to see the guarantees concerning flying training remain in place. There are already concerns regarding the extent of flying training coming from Essendon airport and some of the safety considerations which arise as a result of that, but we are most concerned at the prospect of restrictions on ab initio flight training being abandoned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We also want to seek from the minister guarantees that no attempt will be made to rezone land around Essendon airport. There were, in the past, reports suggesting that land around Essendon airport could be rezoned industrial. Fortunately, the government of the day rejected those reports and recommendations, but we have had National Party MPs suggesting that land around the airport might be rezoned industrial. That would be outrageous and a scandalous thing to do to residents in that area, and we seek assurances that in light of private leasing of the Essendon airport there will not be any such attempts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to put to the minister that if the airport is to be sold to the private sector, why should it not be made a fully open bid? That is to say, the public interest would be best served by having open tenders for aviation and non&hyphen;aviation uses of that site, and, as taxpayers, we and the community ought be able to examine those options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that such a change would not impact on Tullamarine airport. I have personally contacted the Australian Pacific Airports Corporation which are taking over the lease on Tullamarine and they have neither sought, nor obtained, any guarantees regarding the operations at Tullamarine airport and the ways in which they might be affected by Essendon operations being relocated. So we do not see any reason that Essendon should not be put out for fully open bids for whatever use a private sector bidder might be able to put it to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to ask that the minister makes available the departmental advice that he received concerning the future of Essendon airport. The reports are that the departmental advice was that Essendon was unprofitable and its operations ought to be relocated. That is something that we want to see and are entitled to see, and I therefore request that the transport minister makes that departmental advice available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of great concern to people in my electorate that the charge to retain Essendon airport has been made by National Party MPs and, in particular, Senator Julian McGauran. Senator McGauran ought to worry about unemployment in Gippsland which, on yesterday's figures, is 12.9 per cent, the worst result in Victoria. He ought to be doing something about his backyard as I, as a local member, have been doing concerning my backyard by supporting the motor vehicle industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of great concern that it is the personal convenience of Senator McGauran, and his desire to use Essendon airport on his way to work, as it were, that is driving this decision. It is also for the personal convenience of Pat McNamara, who says that having Essendon airport saves him 20 minutes travelling time twice a month. That is a scandalous way to be making public policy and, as I say, it is a matter of great concern to people in the area surrounding Essendon airport that the minister for transport has made this decision under
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5723"> pressure from National Party members and without regard for good public policy on the most appropriate use of this site. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have this opportunity to participate in the committee stage of the deliberations on the budget that was recently brought down by the government. I want to raise an issue which relates to the matters which have been raised in this debate by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson). My concern is not so much the sale of Essendon airport&mdash;although I have expressed a public view on that&mdash;but rather the development of Avalon airport as a dedicated air freight hub for the export of perishable products to South&hyphen;East Asia and other destinations. It is a very important consideration for the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) because this particular development impacts on both areas of his portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would support the view of the honourable member for Wills that Essendon airport ought to be closed down. It is an inappropriate facility to be operating in an inner urban and residential area of a major city. It ought to be closed down and at least part of its functions transferred to Avalon airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Avalon was recently leased by the government to a joint venture between Lindsay Fox and a British company, Serco. The Geelong community has long argued for this facility to be developed as an air freight hub for the export of perishable products. I would encourage the government to support the project through the various programs it is funding in this budget, particularly through its supermarkets to Asia strategy and some other programs that might be appropriate. I hope that the minister for transport will examine those programs and assist the development of this facility in whatever capacity he can .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Avalon airport is situated at the juxtaposition of four key transport assets. There is the airport itself, the Princes Highway, the port of Geelong and the national standard gauge. Very few locations on the face of the earth have this particular transport advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a skilled labor force in the Geelong region. The proposal that we are mounting to turn Avalon into an air freight hub for the export of perishable products will see produce drawn from the south&hyphen;eastern region of Australia, a four&hyphen;state hinterland comprising Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Riverina of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have tertiary institutions very keen to support this development from a training point of view and some very substantial commercial players that are ready to invest in this development. The government did close ASTAS in its first year, with the loss of 450 highly skilled jobs to the Geelong region. I am asking the minister to look closely at this proposal and the government to look to ways to edge this development along. We believe it offers the Geelong region the opportunity to create 5,000 jobs in the immediate Geelong region, if the vision we have for this facility were to become a reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development should assist this particular development on two grounds. The first is the utilisation of a critical transport asset because Avalon is a very high quality airfield compared to others throughout Australia and the second is  regional development because of its job creation potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comparable developments overseas have seen enormous job creation take place around the development of airports as air freight hubs. We certainly have the productive hinterlands to feed this particular facility. All that is required is for the Victorian government to show a bit of metal and a bit of vision and for the federal government to pick up the baton on this project and run with it. I can certainly promise a bipartisan approach to the development of this
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5724"> facility because I have been advocating such a development for well over 4&half; years, as have other members of the Geelong community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, earlier today I took the opportunity to make some observations about the regional development part of this portfolio, or rather I should say the regional development part which used to be in this portfolio until the present government withdrew all of the funding as a result of the announcement made in June or July of last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My comments provoked a response from the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) who has, I acknowledge, a personal interest and background experience in the steel industry. In replying to some comments that I made about the BHP decision to withdraw from primary steel producing in Newcastle and the important core activity that that represented for the regional economy, the member for La Trobe suggested that the market imperatives were of primary importance, if not of exclusive importance. If the market realities were such that profit could not be made for any particular activity, then the obvious decision that private sector owners would make&mdash;that is, to close that activity down&mdash;would appear to be the most appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make two points about that, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I do not want to spend too much time on it. The first one is this: BHP in Newcastle makes a profit. The trouble is, BHP in Newcastle is not making the profit that BHP wants, which is  15 per cent return. No steel industry, no steel corporation anywhere in the world is making 15 per cent. BHP Steel in Newcastle makes a profit. That is the first point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I want to make on this question is that the claim made by the free marketeers, the economic rationalists and the economic libertarians to the effect that market realities must be allowed to rule supreme, is something we have to get right away from. If the market mechanism was appropriate to resolve all of the types of problems that the free marketeers appear to suggest, then we would not have any need for government. We would not have any need for any type of mechanism for the maintenance of social order, social equity, social justice and social security. The market would do the lot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know people will say, `Oh no, it's absurd to take it that far.' But the point I am making is that, once you start to move along the spectrum of the roles that market mechanisms can fulfil, you have to draw the line somewhere. Market mechanisms will not resolve all of society's problems. That is the very reason why government, in a positive way, exists. If we do not exist for those reasons, then we exist for no reason, and government might just as well wither away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For 200 years, people have accepted the fact that market mechanisms are not sufficient to overcome the types of social inequities that a free market system, a free market society and a free market economy may cause. For that reason, it has been accepted that government&mdash;the public sector&mdash;does have a responsibility to attend to those examples of market failure to ensure that where social equity, social justice and social security are not necessarily provided by market forces and the operation of the market, government will be active in those areas. So it is a matter of degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, I believe that line should be drawn not so far along as some of the free marketeers would appear to support. Governments do have a role and governments have to accept that role. The sooner we come to some type of rational decision about where
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5725"> government responsibility ends and where the indicators of the market can be allowed to operate, then the sooner we will be making a better approach to the whole question of public policy. I spent more time on that than I wanted to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter I want to go on to now is the general question of transport funding. I said this morning, and I repeat it again, that the area of funding in regional development has been eliminated, so the only area which remains in this portfolio is that of transport. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> In the area of transport, I am also concerned about the very significant retreat which has taken place as far as policy is concerned on the part of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the national highway system, everyone will be aware that in 1974 the Whitlam government adopted that national highway system and established the intercity links all around Australia&mdash;not all intercity links, the highway from Brisbane to Cairns was an additional road that was put into the Queensland system. There are other examples around Australia. But 16,000 kilometres of highways around Australia were accepted with full responsibility by the federal government as national highways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the period that I had responsibility in the area of land transport, I declared two additional roads, the Sturt Highway in New South Wales and the Newell Highway in New South Wales, linking Adelaide to Sydney and Melbourne through to Brisbane respectively, as additional lengths of the national highway. That added another 2,500 kilometres, for which the federal government took full responsibility. They were added to the national highway network in January 1994 and they are now locked into it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this area, where the federal government has primary responsibility, we see that very serious cuts have been made. It was announced that the cuts over a period of years in the Howard government's allocations to national highways would have been a bit over $600 million. In last year's budget the reduction was $113 million. In this year's budget the reduction is $138 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the two years that this government has been in office, the real reduction in national highway funding has been over 15 per cent. I well remember, because I was the minister responsible, the criticisms that were levelled at the previous Labor government by the then coalition opposition about the level of funding. The level of funding when Labor was in government averaged in excess of $800 million every year. During the One Nation and Working Nation programs the cabinet was responsible for allocating an additional in excess of $600 million into those road networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw attention to some of the transport programs and transport initiatives that were taken during those years. I am delighted, of course, in my usual modest way, to take some credit and to take a great deal of pride in some of those initiatives. I have referred already to the 2,500 kilometres of national highway that were extended as a result of the addition of the Sturt and the Newell highways. There were programs for state arterial roads, programs for provincial cities and rural highways, and programs for local roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the cuts that have taken place in funding for local roads will mean, for all of those 850 local government authorities around Australia, a reduction of something like 400 kilometres of new sealed road every year. I hope people in local government understand that. I hope they realise where the cuts are being made and who is making them. We introduced the black spots program together with a 10&hyphen;point road safety program and those initiatives together were responsible for bringing down fatalities on the roads each year from something like 2,400 to a number below 2,000. I know that it is now crawling up again.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5726">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Urban public transport provided the states with a lot of urban transport opportunities that would not have been available to them otherwise. We established a National Road Trauma Council, the National Road Transport Commission and the National Rail Corporation, an important initiative which this government is in the process of considering the best way to dispose of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last decision that I participated in before I ceased to be minister was with Allan Brown, the Victorian transport minister. We came to an agreement to complete the last link&mdash;from Melbourne through to Adelaide&mdash;in the standardised rail right around Australia. That then stands as a monument not only to the Liberal government in Victoria and Allan Brown as the minister, but also to a Labor government in Canberra and Bob Brown the minister at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the ways in which a national government can accept responsibility not only for transport itself&mdash;and the tremendous importance that transport has to the development of the national economy&mdash;but for the important role that it plays in regional Australia. That is why those two portfolios are linked together. That is why they should be funded, and funded adequately.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address my remarks at this stage of the debate to the regional development portion of the transport and regional development portfolio. It is very clear that there is a central failure of the government's economic policy, especially in relation to the regions of Australia. I travelled throughout those regions after the first budget and after the second budget, and there is a deep sense of betrayal at what the government has done to the regions of Australia in those two budgets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that infamous first Howard budget when the funding for the regional development program was completely withdrawn by the federal government. For the life of me I cannot understand how the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) can come into the parliament and say that he is the minister for regional development when, by his own admission in that press release after the first budget, he declared that the federal government had no constitutional interest in the area of regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, what followed in that budget was a reduction in business support programs that have hit regional businesses. There has been a massive curtailment in labour market programs that delivered skill formation to rural and regional businesses and, of course, there was the abandonment of the building better cities program, which was a vital conduit for getting moneys into regional businesses throughout Australia. We see that the essential funding has not been restored in the budget that has been delivered by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reflection of the government's failure in the area of regional policy is contained in the unemployment statistics that were released recently. We see that the state of Victoria is bearing the brunt of conservative governments at both the state and federal level, with massive increases in the rate of regional unemployment since the Howard government came to power in March 1996. To quote some of the statistics that have been recently released, we have seen a dramatic increase in the unemployment rate from 8.4 per cent in my particular region, the Barwon&hyphen;Western District region, to 12.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a massive increase in unemployment in my own region, and that story is repeated throughout the length and breadth of Victoria. Clearly, through the length and breadth of its programs&mdash;and not only in this portfolio but in other areas in the budget that it recently delivered&mdash;the government is failing to deliver the critical support that is required for the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5727"> regions of Australia to sustain their economic base in the face of significant rationalisations that have been undertaken in both public and private sector employment over the past five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the Kennett government in Victoria drive the boot into country Victoria, but we thought perhaps that the Howard government, with a significant National Party input, would be more sympathetic to the desires and aspirations of the regions. But, no: not only did the first boot go in with the Kennett government but the second boot went in with the current federal government in its first and second budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we asked of the coalition government when it came to power was to maintain the high levels of growth and job creation that we had given in the past four years with a four per cent growth rate. That was a fairly simple task, we thought, because we had done it over the past four years. But, in your first budget, you admitted defeat. You rolled over and admitted defeat by saying to the Australian people and to the people in the regions, `We can only manage 3.5 per cent.' You admitted defeat again in the budget that you have just delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot for the life of me understand where you are at, and neither can the regions of Australia. They know now. There is a real and deep sense of betrayal. The payback will come at election time, because the National Party has betrayed country constituencies, and the rural Liberals have done nothing either.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank members from both sides of the House for their contribution to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98. There have been some very emotional speeches and some very major contributions from some. I will not mention all the names, but there were certainly some in relation to Newcastle. We all feel a sense of sadness for the people of Newcastle. That has been reflected from both sides of the House. It is a genuine concern, and the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) spoke extremely well in relation to the situation in Newcastle&mdash;being a former steelworker himself and understanding the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot help myself in relation to responding to the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). He said that the government has done nothing for regional development. He comes from the city of Geelong. What have we done in relation to car tariffs that will directly benefit the people of Geelong and the people of this nation? We have halted the tariff reduction that Labor put in place and we are ensuring jobs for the people of Geelong and many other parts of regional Australia, including up in the mid&hyphen;north coast of New South Wales&mdash;and so the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) will have jobs for people in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Corio has left the committee, and no wonder: he did not want to hear the truth of what we have done. He has run away. He has slunk out of the chamber. We are creating jobs. As the member for Charlton said, there is a role for the government. We acknowledge that. Our decision in relation(Mr Robert Brown) to tariffs for the motor car industry was appropriate, and it is going to support not only the motor car industry but component manufacturing industries in regional Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will listen to your side of the debate in silence; I would hope you would extend the same courtesy to this side of the House. I will just touch on federal road funding and regional development. The other side of the House seems to have lost something in relation to regional development. We are committed, and remain committed, to regional Australia. That is clearly evident by the fact that we have established a ministerial working
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5728"> group on regional affairs. Those RDOs that were put in place under Labor are still out there, where the people in the regions wanted to put them together. We think it is appropriate that local government is involved, because local government is the level of government closest to the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me outline some areas of funding going into our regions. We have $75 million going to the Pacific Highway. I well remember the member for Charlton when he was transport minister. I think it was during the election campaign of 1990 and there were the tragedies of the road accidents and deaths on the Pacific Highway. None of us liked witnessing those tragedies. To ensure that the Pacific Highway is funded, we have given the Pacific Highway its own line in the Budget. I think if members on the other side of the House were honest with themselves they would say that the only way to commit to a road such as the Pacific Highway, which was in chronic need of upgrading in many areas to prevent dangerous accidents and many deaths occurring, is to give it its own line in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $75 million of road funding on the Pacific Highway will see jobs created in regional Australia and will also see a much safer road infrastructure in a very fast growing region. We are going to spend $696 million on the national highway system. We have $112 million for roads of national importance. We have reinstated the $36 million that is going to the road safety black spot program that was abolished by the Labor Party. They said that local government could pick up those black spots. We have reinstated it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have done a lot for regional development and I have to remind those on the other side of the House of what we have done. There is the $250 million for regional telecommunications infrastructure, another job creation program that will bring much better telecommunications infrastructure into regional Australia. There is $1.25 billion going into the National Heritage Trust, an injection of funds into our greatest natural resource&mdash;that is, our land, our rivers, our streams. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> There is $58 million going into the national landcare program and $10 million for tourism in regional and rural Australia. So there is a range of initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge those on the other side of the House to go back to their offices, look up the appropriation bills, find those programs, go into their constituencies and promote them, because they will help their own constituencies. That is their responsibility&mdash;to work for their constituents. There are a lot of initiatives that will assist regional and rural communities. There is funding to ensure that we have a national road program. We have identified the needs of the Pacific Highway, with its own line in the Budget. This is a government that understands the needs of our regions, and also understands the need for a national road infrastructure. We are committed to a national highway program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I want to thank those members from both sides of the House. I urge them to go and look at the budget appropriation bills, because there are a lot of initiatives there that they can be involved in with their communities and that will advantage their own communities. Many of them, of course, live in regional areas. I thank members.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must very briefly respond to a couple of the points that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) made. I appreciate, as have others, the fact that so many ministers have been here to hear the consideration in detail stage of the appropriations of concern to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Minister Scott knows that the black spots program was initially introduced by the Labor government. It was supposed to be a program initially of $40 million. It was so
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5729"> successful in achieving all of the objectives that had been set for it that we finished up applying a total of in excess of $270 million to it. I have no objection to the re&hyphen;introduction of that particular program with funding of $36 million per year. I hope it achieves the same sort of success as it did under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the Pacific Highway is concerned, one would believe almost that it had been ignored by the Labor government, but in fact we were responsible for contributing towards a program which represented $300 million going into that highway over a period of three years. I know the points that were made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs reflect his knowledge of the very serious problems that were posed by that road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that I want to make brief mention of before we conclude the discussion on the transport appropriation is to make an appeal to the government to consider very carefully what it may finish up doing with the Indian Pacific rail service and perhaps the Ghan service as well. Under the previous government, the Ghan was completely refurbished and became the first major train service of that kind to be significantly improved. There was then a program of $12 million for the refurbishment of the Indian Pacific. There is no question that those two services, in particular, are two of the really great train journeys of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone realises that, throughout the world now, tourists are increasingly looking for experiences of that kind. We have, for example, the Orient Express trains in Europe and Asia, and Rovos Rail in southern Africa, and I will be taking the opportunity later on this year to have a close look at Rovos Rail. I will be going on that service between Pretoria and Lake Victoria. Let me say at this stage, to get it in the record, that I will be doing that trip at my expense because I am interested in the developed of these services. Rovos is privately owned. Rohan Vos has undertaken private investment for the refurbishment of all of those trains. It is a magnificent service, and I am looking forward to having a look at the way in which private services are operating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the Rocky Mountaineer in Canada and the Sunset Limited in the US. We have had the traditional trans&hyphen;Siberian railway services, and all of these at the present time are in the process of development.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the division, I was making an appeal to the minister, to the government and to the government's advisers to give close consideration to all of the options that might exist in relation to those rail services. I know there are problems associated with their operation at the present time. I am not sure what the annual debt is of the Indian Pacific but I know that it is substantial. But there are people now who travel around the world looking for tourist experiences and adventures. Any people with whom you speak who may have had the opportunity to go on the Indian Pacific either from Perth to Sydney or from Sydney to Perth all speak so well of it. When I have had an opportunity to be on it I find it is really quite remarkable to see the diversity of people from so many different countries around the world. When you talk to them, you get some idea of the number of people who travel to Australia simply to take that trip because they have heard of it. It is a magnificent trip. People who believe that the Nullarbor is boring find that it is anything but boring when they get on the Indian Pacific.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I appeal to all of our colleagues, and encourage them, to take the Indian Pacific if they have to go from Sydney to Perth at any time, instead of flying
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5730"> over&mdash;with all of the traumas associated with that. In fact, what we should be doing is taking advantage of the opportunity to use rail services more often. Everyone says they love travelling by rail and no&hyphen;one is doing it. I appeal again to the government and their advisers to ensure that the Indian Pacific and the Ghan are not mothballed, that they examine all of the options, and that they ensure that those magnificent train journeys continue to operate for all the people who would seek to take advantage of them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about the all&hyphen;important issue of regional Australia, and in doing so to place some facts on the record going to the failure of the government to actively support regional Australia, not only in the most recent budget but also in the budget of last August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in the lead-up to the election, said that he was going to govern for all Australians. I will tell you what: there is one section of Australia that has lost, and lost dramatically, as a result of this government's decisions in its first two budgets. I would remind the chamber that soon after being elected, the Howard government said that there was no constitutional role for the government to actually serve and assist regional Australia. I must say that to me there is one issue of major importance to regional Australia at the moment. That goes to the questions of jobs and job security. For regional Australia, it has been a wasted 15 months of government; regional Australia has lost. It has lost because of a failure of this government to give support for initiatives aimed at attracting industry and investment. It has lost because this government has really walked away from its responsibility to give ongoing support, for example, to area consultative committees and regional economic development organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts speak for themselves. The Prime Minister, in the lead-up to the recent budget, went all around Australia in the media suggesting that he was going to get relevant. That was the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in the week before the recent budget. The Prime Minister, after 12 months, thought it was necessary that he had to thump his chest and tell regional Australia that he was going to get relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you why he had to tell regional Australia that he was going to get relevant: there was one reason and one reason alone. He basically failed regional Australia on the question of jobs. I would like to refer to this government's record with respect to jobs in regional Australia after the first 12 months. It is interesting to note that outside of the capital cities, after the first 12 months of this government, 77 per cent of rural and regional Australia have seen no dent in the unemployment queue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to a couple of states, because facts speak loudly. Outside of the Melbourne metropolitan area, unemployment went from 8.5 per cent in March 1996 to 10.3 per cent in March 1997. Outside of the Sydney metropolitan area, unemployment went from 9.8 per cent in March 1996 to 10.6 per cent in March 1997. I know the Minister for Veterans' Affairs does not like these facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Outside of the Brisbane metropolitan area, unemployment grew from 10.3 per cent to 11.5 per cent in the first 12 months of this government. Outside of the Perth metropolitan area, unemployment grew from 7.5 per cent to eight per cent. Finally, outside of the Adelaide metropolitan area, unemployment grew from 7.3 per cent to 7.8 per cent. Yet this government has the hide to come in here today and suggest that it is a government that governs for all of Australia. It has the hide to come here today and suggest that it cares about unemployment in regional Australia. Regional Australia has lost because of a lack of attention and support
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5731"> for regional Australia. Regional Australia requires a government that is prepared to get involved, roll up its sleeves and offer a helping hand to try to reduce unemployment in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real problem is that it is getting worse. I take the chamber to the most recent long&hyphen;term regional unemployment figures and I will deal, by way of example, with the seats of Richmond, Page, Cowper and Lyne. In March 1996, unemployment was 11.8 per cent. Guess what it is this week in four coalition seats: it is 14.5 per cent. This government suggests that it cares about unemployment in regional Australia. I would hate to see what the government is doing for those seats if it did not come in here and claim that it was delivering on the issue of jobs. In that area, there are now 3,000 more unemployed people than there were in March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not the real black spot. There are worse areas of regional unemployment as a result of the first 15 months of this government and the fact that in its budget strategy it has walked away from its responsibilities. It has taken jobs and services out of regional Australia. It has closed Commonwealth Employment Service offices. It has closed taxation offices. It has closed Family Law Court opportunities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not actually intended to speak in this debate but I must say I was appalled by the contribution made by the shadow minister opposite. One could have taken into account what he said more seriously if he was not part of a government that destroyed 420,000 full&hyphen;time jobs during the recession that we had to have. It ought to be noted that full&hyphen;time employment fell from 6.2 million in July 1990 to 5.8 million in November 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also outlined some of the figures in relation to unemployment in rural and regional Australia. The simple fact of the matter is that his government had no ideas; they ran out of them. In fact, youth unemployment in much of rural and regional Australia was up around 30 per cent. This government has a range of programs designed to give new opportunities to young people, not only in rural and regional Australia but also in urban and metropolitan areas. I think people are sick and tired of absolute hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member opposite is a member of a party which in government was responsible for the worst recession we ever had. It was a government which simply could not tell the truth. It was a government which was prepared to do and say anything to crawl back into office. It was a government that saw 313,000 men lose full&hyphen;time work, many of those people in rural and regional Australia. I think it is about time that the honourable member opposite stood up and was honest and said that the Labor Party over the last 13 years made a monumental botch&hyphen;up in the area of unemployment. They failed to offer hope to young Australians. They, indeed, were complete and utter failures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If he came in here and said that Labor got it wrong over the last 13 years; if he came in here and said that their policies were disastrous for rural and regional Australia, he would have credibility and he would have the right to criticise what this government is doing. His party was a government which was responsible for the worst economic situation that this country has ever seen&mdash;a government which, during its 13 years in government, had an average unemployment figure of 8.7 per cent. He fails to recognise that the coalition has only been in office for 15 months and that the benefits of the very many programs which we have implemented have not yet flowed through to the job market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5732">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask that he be honest. I would ask that he express regret for the disaster that was the Labor government over the last 13 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the contribution of the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). But I am prepared to deal with the facts; he was rather provocative as to the question of truth. Last Thursday evening, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> , the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) wanted the Australian public to believe that we ought to be patient, that it is a big ship and it is really a huge problem to turn it around. He was talking about the question of unemployment. But, after all, facts tell the real story.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to deal with the performance of this government after the first 15 months in office. Let us go to the issue of facts and the question of jobs. In the 15 months since the Howard government took office, the number of jobs has only risen by 86,800. More importantly, the number of full&hyphen;time jobs has actually fallen by 700. The number of male full&hyphen;time jobs has fallen by 9,900. The number of people unemployed has only risen by 39,000, because unemployment has risen from 8.5 to 8.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now go to the issue of youth unemployment, where we are now all about fudging the figures with the new youth allowance, hiding young unemployed people, forcing them off benefits. I will tell you why. The Prime Minister said at the National Press Club on the eve of the election that he would be judged by his performance on the question of youth unemployment. What we have is a new strategy now about honesty and integrity in government; it is about fudging the figures. And I am not surprised, because after 12 months the youth unemployment rate has risen&mdash;yes, risen. That is a real problem for this government, because the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) is correct&mdash;this government has to be judged by its performance on the issue of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am prepared to basically judge our performance, as the previous government, against the performance of this government in its first 12 months. That is what the member for Fisher challenged me to do. Unemployment under this government in the first 15 months has risen from 8.5 to 8.8 per cent. What did the current Prime Minister, who was the then Treasurer, leave us with in March 1983? Surprise, surprise&mdash;he left us with double&hyphen;digit unemployment&mdash;a pretty big ship, as he described it on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> last Thursday; a big unemployment ship to turn around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the member for Fisher is yet again running for cover, because he does not want to deal with the facts. We reduced unemployment, in our first 12 months, from 10 per cent to 8.9 per cent. As he puts his tail between his legs and runs out of the chamber, because he does not want to deal with the facts about unemployment, I would again take him to the question of regional Australia. I have dealt with some of the Northern Rivers seats in New South Wales. Let us go to the real black spot on the unemployment front in regional Australia at the moment&mdash;Victoria. Rural and regional Victoria has become the black spot, and we know they like to talk about black spots. Regional unemployment is now 11.2 per cent, compared to a pretty bad state average in Victoria of 9.2 per cent. We have a coalition government at a state level there, as well as at the federal level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ought to go region by region. In the Barwon&hyphen;Western District region it is 10.9 per cent, a huge achievement. In March 1996 it was 8.4 per cent&mdash;and they say they are creating jobs!
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5733"> They want us all to believe that this government cares about regional Australia and is committed to trying to reduce unemployment queues in regional Australia. Let us go to the Central Highlands and Wimmera. I know the Deputy Speaker understands the importance of these issues as a representative of rural Australia. Unemployment&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;is 9.8 per cent in that region. That is a bit higher than the national average, but what was it in March last year? It was 7.9 per cent. That is another great achievement, one that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) likes to stand up and gloat about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will go to the Loddon&hyphen;Mallee district. It is 12.3 per cent&mdash;a bit worse than the state average of 9.2, the gift of Jeff Kennett for John Howard, but much worse than the national average. What was it 15 months ago? It was 10.4 per cent. I tell you what, they are really getting the runs on the board! The Prime Minister is playing on a sticky wicket when he talks about unemployment in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We go to the Goulburn&hyphen;Ovens&hyphen;Murray region with 8.1 per cent. If you care about regional Australia, you have to be prepared to invest in regional Australia&mdash;to prop up and support regional initiatives under area consultative committees, to be willing to get involved and to get your hands a little dirty in trying to develop local economic development strategies and to be willing to support labour market programs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LS4">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is why I was really trying to deal with the all-important question of how you support regional initiatives such as REDOs and area consultative committees. Do you know what REDOs and area consultative committees used to do? They used to really embrace those Working Nation labour market type of programs because out in regional Australia there is a real problem in raising the necessary expenditure to support capital works. I can understand that because I believe that regional Australia is entitled to the same level of services that we receive in metropolitan Australia. That is why regional economic development organisations are of the utmost importance to regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that note, I want to talk about the fact that regional economic development organisations are now most concerned about the fact that the Working Nation programs were ripped away from them. This government wants us to believe, for example, that Green Corps is of assistance to regional Australia. I will tell you that it is not of much assistance to regional Australia and, more importantly, it is not of much assistance to the unemployed. The facts show that in the first round of pilot projects under Green Corps, the majority of people were either employed or engaged in full-time education. The opportunities did not even go, in regional Australia, to unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I were a National Party representative, for example, of those northern New South Wales seats, I would be crying out for support for the unemployed&mdash;not support for people who have jobs or education opportunities. I would compare that with the old LEAP programs that the old REDOs used to really embrace and support and try to provide infrastructure in their regions with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go, for example, to Green Corps&mdash;a mere $3.7 million for 1996&hyphen;97. That compares with nearly $90 million under the former Labor Party government's LEAP program&mdash;the old landcare and environment action program.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5734">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). Let us deal with the facts and the real issues that Australians are concerned about at the moment&mdash;the issues that regional Australia is, in some ways, I suppose, off its face about. Their view is that this government has walked away from its responsibilities. The real issue goes to the question of unemployment and the requirement to put in place regional initiatives that do something to assist regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to assist regional Australia then, for example, it is not smart to close the Taxation Office in Launceston, it is not smart to close the Department of Immigration office in Townsville, and it is not smart to close the CES office in Mareeba because they are all local jobs that regional Australia depends on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you take those jobs out of regional Australia, you do not just take government jobs out of regional Australia but you actually take out regional Australian private sector jobs because those pay packets disappear from regional Australia. Public servants are not buying local goods and services and therefore the private sector jobs disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand why the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is looking a little concerned at the moment because when we lay the facts on the table the conclusion is that this government does not care about the all-important concept of one nation, of one Australia and of all Australians being entitled to the same level of services, irrespective of whether you live in metropolitan Australia or regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put to the House that the Commonwealth government has a responsibility to get involved and assist regional Australia. The Commonwealth government has the responsibility to actually develop regional initiatives such as the old REDOs aimed at trying to create jobs and, in the meantime, also assist the unemployed with decent labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what it comes back to: do you care about Australia at large? Are you going to run away from your responsibilities for regional Australia? Do you believe that the high level of unemployment that currently exists, for example, in the Northern Rivers seats of New South Wales is acceptable? Or is it the view of this government that it is prepared to cop ghettos in the Northern Rivers area of New South Wales, as indicated by its lack of support for important country towns such as Lismore? I know that does not count much to the coalition government because in the end it is has got a huge majority and it is prepared to sacrifice a few seats on the way through. But I do care because if you do not invest in those regions and actually support regional initiatives, you end up with an underclass in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government might be prepared to tolerate a regional and rural underclass; I am not prepared to tolerate a regional and rural underclass. As far as I am concerned, whether you live in Mareeba, Burnie, Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide, you are entitled to the same level of services, the same investment, and a willingness by the government to actually lead and make hard decisions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on a few aspects of this department's expenditure, particularly as it applies to the new aged care reforms. I am sorry that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is not here to hear these remarks, but I presume she will read them at some point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5735">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, too, want to place on the record my support for the thrust of the reforms, particularly the accommodation bonds option of funding infrastructure for nursing home accommodation. Somewhere this week I saw a mention that $1 billion, or thereabouts, is needed to bring the system up to standard. Obviously, as much as we would like to pay for that bill from the public purse, it is just not feasible. So the users who can pay option is the only route.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just let me clear the record. During my move to splendid independent isolation in the House in the week that the vote was taken on the aged care bill, I became a little disorganised without the aid of any unofficial whipping support, so <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show my voting against the bill but supporting the consequential amendments. I misread the third reading division as another attempt to gag debate and so literally misplaced my support for the legislation. I correct that now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I must say that there is still a great deal of concern out there in the regions&mdash;and elsewhere, I presume&mdash;about certain aspects of this legislation. Let me just detail them quickly. Those providers of concessional only or near enough to total pensioner clients are concerned at the lack of capital funding the system will provide. The St Vincent de Paul organisation in Orange is one which doubts its ability to raise sufficient funding through bonds, and it certainly does not believe that the $5 a day contribution from the Commonwealth will go anywhere near meeting that need. They are talking about at least a doubling of that amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Uralba Hostel at Carcoar is typical of a smaller rural community aged care centre. It believes that the $5 a day for concessional residents will go no way towards meeting its capital requirements. These shortcomings in the plan are causing real concern out there and are jeopardising the positive sale of these reforms in the marketplace. This money&mdash;that is, the $5 a day&mdash;will provide for this Carcoar hostel $9,250 per client over five years, while a bond could deliver $13,000 in the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You see, the home with concessional patients is worse off. Why can't they access a bond? Because in very many cases the partner is living in the home, or on the farm, and there are no assets to access to pay the bond. It is a catch&hyphen;22 situation. There is, according to Uralba Hostel at Carcoar, no way they are going to be able to pay for capital rebuilding or upgrading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Uralba agrees totally with the ageing in place philosophy, keeping elderly people in hostels where possible. But, if they are forced to push these people into nursing home accommodation&mdash;and they are becoming more and more every day nursing home&hyphen;type patients&mdash;the subsidies they will receive are well below what they get now and they will not be able to meet capital updates. They will not even meet the standards to be able to charge bonds and will not, perhaps, be able to survive in places like Carcoar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take the case of Yeoval multipurpose health centre, once just the district hospital, which was closed by the state government. The community fought like blazes and started their own cooperative health care which has grown into the model for multiservice health delivery. I would urge the minister to take a look at that facility, perhaps visit it, and see what I believe is the future of integrated hospital health and aged care delivery in rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yeoval entered into a recurrent funding agreement with the federal government, took out a loan, and is being repaid by the Commonwealth for that capital program. Now it has to decide whether to maintain that arrangement or go down the uncertain path of accommodation bonds and the $5 per day for concessional residents path with all the same concerns that Carcoar has about its aged care capacity under these reforms.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5736">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realize there is $40 million set aside for rural and remote areas to address critical capital funding problems, but I suspect neither this amount nor the $5 per day contribution will go anywhere near being sufficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the minister to seriously consider what I have said here today. I support the thrust of these reforms but the expenditure details, I believe, are seriously flawed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to specifically address, in these few minutes that I have, the questions that arise from the decisions the government has taken, as evidenced in the budget papers, to do with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I am particularly concerned at the changes to the therapeutic group premium, as it is formally called, which are apparently going to take effect from February next year. As we know, this is going to make Australian citizens have to pay more for the latest and safest or most effective medication in the six drug groups that are treating things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, ulcers, depression and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for my major concern is the comments that were made by the president of the AMA, Dr Keith Woollard, very shortly after this decision was announced in the budget. He has said that although separate medications within the six nominated classes had similar therapeutic effects, they could have different side effects which made them less appropriate for some patients. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have lumped them together as drugs having basically identical actions, but in fact they don't.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I find that particularly alarming when it is coming from someone like the president of the AMA. I couple that with statements from the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, where they feel that it is necessary to monitor the changes that are going to take place under the PBS through this new strategy. The national president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia said that the PSA would monitor the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme contained in the 1997 federal budget to detect whether or not they were having any adverse effects on consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it pretty appalling that a government can take a decision where, first of all, the AMA has a view quite different on medical grounds to the government's and, secondly, an organisation like the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia believes it is necessary to monitor for adverse effects. I do not think that it would be very responsible for a government to take a decision in the health area where there could be any question of adverse effects on consumers. Mr Plunkett, the president of the PSA, has said that while some people argue that some of the moves may be a cost saving measure for the government, others argue that it will significantly change prescribing patterns and adversely affect the health of patients who will not be able to afford to buy those more expensive drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seriously believe that the government needs to look very carefully at what it is doing to the PBS, for two reasons. First of all, the PBS as we know it in Australia has been a very highly applauded and, might I say, highly envied process by the rest of the world. It has worked extremely effectively and has been held up as a model for many places around the world when they look at the way that we can dispense pharmaceuticals on a fair and even basis to our community. Secondly, and even more importantly, there is the question of whether or not it is going to adversely affect the health of those people in this country who may not have any choice in terms of whether they can afford to buy the preferred drug.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5737">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also ask this question of the minister: when, if ever, will the detailed arrangements and costings of the new structure be made available? The model has, I believe, been talked about in Senate estimates; we do not have that detail, it has not been made available. I think it is terribly important to everybody involved in this process that they have access to that detail. As I said at the outset, I raise very sincere concerns on the basis of health care and I question the government's decision in this PBS process very seriously indeed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the five minutes that I have, I want to refer to the child&hyphen;care aspects of the expenditure. In looking at child care, we need to look at the 1996 and 1997 budgets, because some of the effects of the 1996 budget are only now taking effect. In the 1996 budget, we saw a $500 million cut in child&hyphen;care funding and in 1997 we have seen a further cut of $321 million&mdash;amounting to a $821 million cut in two budgets. This, of course, is going to have a devastating effect on child care, throughout the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Initially, I want to relate one example of a single parent who came into see me. I do expect that, when I get back into the electorate at the end of next week, there will be quite a number of people who use child care coming in to see me. The single parent&mdash;a single lady with one child&mdash;is going to TAFE at the moment to study to improve her skills so that she can get employment. Her actual child&hyphen;care bill has increased by $36.50 since May. Taking into account that she is a single mother on a pension, that is an astronomical amount of money. Of course, the end result is that she cannot now afford to keep her child in child care for the full week, and has now withdrawn her child from the child care facility for at least two days per week and has to use other arrangements through parents and grandparents. This is at considerable inconvenience to herself because she has to travel considerable distances to take her child to be minded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To clarify the cost increase of $36.50 since May, it comes about in two stages. Firstly, as a result of changes to child&hyphen;care assistance, the child&hyphen;care fee for this particular lady went up from $28 per week to $43 per week&mdash;an increase of $15 per week from 26 May. Secondly, as a result of the removal of the operational subsidy which will take effect from 1 July, her fee per week for that one child went up from $43 per week to $64 per week&mdash;an increase over that period of $36.50. This is quite outrageous. It is totally impossible for people to keep their children in child care when they are on low incomes and have large bills and a mortgage to pay&mdash;or, as is the case with this particular lady&mdash;when they are actually on a pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having given that example, I just want to give a little background to child care in general. Maybe a lot of people do not know that this was not a Labor Party piece of legislation. It was not the Labor government that introduced child care. It was, in fact, the McMahon government in 1972 which introduced child care, in recognition of the increasing number of women in the labour force and the subsequent need to provide affordable, quality child care to their children. In hindsight, of course, this was a very noble and far&hyphen;reaching piece of legislation. It certainly showed a lot of vision in relation to the numbers of women who have entered the work force over that period. But now we see a government of the same persuasion actually cutting back on child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for child&hyphen;care places to assist women in the work force should be recognised. The rate of female participation in the work force has increased from 40.6 per cent in 1972, when it was introduced, to 53.4 per cent in 1996. This increase has been particularly high in the 25&hyphen; to 59&hyphen;year&hyphen;old age group. My own particular electorate contains a large, fast growing residential area where two&hyphen;income families reside and more young families are moving in at
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5738"> a rapid rate. There is, therefore, an urgent need for family support services, particularly child care, to allow both parents to take part in either full&hyphen;time or part&hyphen;time work so that the family's budget can be balanced. Clearly, this is no time to decrease child&hyphen;care funding; it is now time to increase it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also been suggested that low income families will have a considerable increase in the cost of their child care. It was thought initially that that might be between $29.50 and $50.90, but in the case that I have quoted there was an increase of $36.50. There are some industrial consequences too. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too want to speak in this budget debate on this particular area. I not only want to touch on what my colleagues have mentioned&mdash;and I will come back to that&mdash;but also want to say how I believe some of these cuts have hurt some of the most disadvantaged families in our electorates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already condemned the cuts and I do so again here quite publicly. For example, look at the cuts to pharmaceuticals where another $700 million has been taken, after $500 million was taken last year. We are looking at a situation where people out there will pay in the vicinity of $20 for a prescription. Look at the cuts to child care, where $320 million is to go over four years, and that is on top of the $500 million cut we endured last year. Look at what is happening to public housing. Something like $400 million is to be cut there. I know it does not necessarily relate here, but I still want to touch on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The savings spoken about are going to come by increasing the cost of drugs for those who are least able to afford it. We find that there is going to be $112 million saved by abolishing the subsidy on a number of those medicines. If you talk to some of the pensioners who can ill afford to pay the price now and you say to them, `You will probably be paying in the vicinity of $9 for a prescription,' they reply, `Where are we going to get the money from?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who can afford it will pay for the best but people who can ill afford it are the ones who will be caught in the trap. I think it is appalling that the government is saying to them, `You're going to have to take the generic brand. You're going to have to tell your doctor that he has to give you the generic brand because this is the way we are going to save all this marvellous amount of money.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who are very ill, and especially the aged, do not understand the treatment they are getting. They cannot say to their doctor, `Look, if you give me drug X, I really cannot afford to pay for it. You have got to give me drug Y because that is what the government said I am supposed to be taking.' Evidently, government members now know that it is going to have a bad effect on particular people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aged people get used to taking medicine of a certain colour and a certain shape. They get used to the doctor who treats them. They know they must take their red one at this time and their blue one at this time. How do we convince those people to change? I am referring to the aged in my community. The generic brand may be a different colour or a different shape, so who is going to say to them, `Don't worry about that, it's cheaper for the government and that is why you are going to change. If you get mixed up and you find that your tablets are not doing the right thing, don't worry about that either, you can always come back and see us'? That is really an appalling stance on which to base some of the savings we are going to make in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One war veteran came to me and he said, `I've got a special cream that is prescribed for me on the free list because of an allergy I picked up during the years I was away fighting.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5739"> Does that mean I've got to pay for it?' We investigated that for him&mdash;he is quite an elderly man&mdash;and we found, yes, that cream is going to come off the free list as well. I had to get back to him and say, `Yes, it is, but we will try and take another tack for you, we will go to the Department of Veterans' Affairs.' The ointment is something he has to use for the eczema that goes all over his body but it is now going to be taken off the list. I do not think the government has considered how some of these decisions are going to affect the people in the street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you talk about child care it looks very clear cut&mdash;$320 million over four years. It is almost like going back to the days when you were told, `You have your kids. Stay home and look after them.' It is saying to the women who make up 52 per cent of the population, `If you have your kids, you are not going to have a job. Get out. We want to get the unemployed back into jobs. We are going to do it for the sake of the family.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an appalling situation. We are going to go back to what was referred to many years ago as latchkey kids. I remember, even in my own community, kids of eight, nine and 10 going home with a key around their necks. You used to think it happened only in the movies and you only read about it. This is fact; this is what happened. That key was on a chain around their necks and they had to use that to let themselves in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not realise the ramifications that are going to occur in communities like mine where the mother and the father are both out in the work force. They are now going to have to pay up to double the fees. They will not be able to pay the fees in the child-care centres where the increases have averaged between $27 and $43 a week. That is an appalling cost on top of everything else that parents on very limited incomes have to cope with. They are trying to add to society through their work. They are also trying to make sure that their children are looked after properly on the limited amount of money that they bring home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think that the government should go backwards and say, `In future, if you want your child minded, and if you cannot afford to pay those fees, that is going to be bad luck. Tell you eldest kid to pick the kids up from school and bring them home,' or, worse, go back to what it was previously. I can go back 15 to 20 years ago when you virtually had a little backyard shed where children were minded because it was offered at a cheaper rate. I do not think we should go backwards and I do not think we have a need to go backwards. I believe that is what some of these cuts will do. There are a lot of other things I want to touch on and I will get to them when I get another call.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, one of the difficulties when dealing with such a large portfolio as Health and Family Services is that when we consider it in detail we jump around all over the place on different topics. At some stage, whilst we cannot dictate to the minister how he wants to handle responses, he might try to get some order or he might choose to respond to some of the topics already raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to raise the therapeutic premium groups decision of the budget. I think it is an important decision that needs to be explained because it is a vast extension from generic prescribing to, as it now seems to be called, brand premium. The problem there is that, of course, under generic prescribing we developed a system that was dependent upon the drugs being the same and having the same bioequivalence but under different brand names. This was important for the generic manufacturers who were coming on board as drugs came out of patent. It gave them an attempt to compete against those that had already got the drug listed
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5740"> under different brand names. In fact, to the extent with which we can have that form of competition to have the drugs listed, it engendered that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the theory behind the therapeutic group premium is dependent upon the fact that, and I quote from an answer in the Senate estimates, `the drugs are very similar, chemically related drugs.' The problem is that they are not the same. I think the minister would understand that. It is not for me to talk to him about medical practice, but there will be situations where these drugs will not suit the patient's circumstance. That is the difficulty with this in the clinical sense. There will be patients that require to have other drugs in the group for whatever reasons. It is one of the quirks, I suppose, of modern medicine that these things happen, especially for some of the conditions where patients will be having a cocktail of medicines and therefore really need those medicines adjusted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that I might add is that these are drugs that are already listed. We are not talking about generic manufacturers trying to bring on a new brand name of the same drug. I reject the argument that the therapeutic groups premium will create the competition that is suggested because it is a very closed market dependent upon the listing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that has to be stressed and is sometimes I think glossed over and ignored is that those drugs that get listed on the pharmaceutical benefits schemes are listed at costs that are much reduced compared with what drug companies can achieve on more open markets overseas. Already, over the years, because of the nature of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and because of the nature of the way in which drugs are listed, we have been able to attempt to put a lid on the costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the minister, like his predecessors under Labor administrations, will jump up and down and say that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, if you look at the graph, is going right out of the ceiling. But he has to acknowledge that attempts have been made to put a ceiling on that and to dampen it. But I just believe that the therapeutic groups premium is not the type of thing which is likely to achieve the results that are suggested. It is not likely to get the acceptance with the consumer that is expected. Already we have had to have a very softly, softly approach to generic brand funding. The honourable member for Prospect (Ms Crosio) talked about people preferring their red tablets and their blue tablets. One of the real things that we had to be careful about with generic prescribing was where there was a change in the colour and the shape the patient was going to have some rejection of the concept. We have slowly but surely, I believe, won the battle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we probably have not done yet is educate the consumer to ask the questions at the right stage. Even under generic prescribing, the patient is there with the general practitioner, the GP writes out the script, the patient takes it to the chemist, it is dispensed, and it may not be until the patient gets to the cash register that he realises that, under the brand premium scheme, he has a higher cost drug. These things need continual education. It is too early and too ambitious for the therapeutic premium group scheme. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98 to raise the issue of Medicare office closures. Two office closures in my electorate will be caused by this budget: one in Leichhardt, situated at Leichhardt Market Town; and one in Marrickville Road, Marrickville, just down the road from my electorate office. A third closure&mdash;that of the Campsie office&mdash;in the electorate of the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) will also impact on my constituents around the Canterbury area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5741">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These office closures were foreshadowed in last year's budget. Thus 12 months of uncertainty have been caused by this government. Last year a document indicated that up to 86 offices might be closed throughout the nation. The budget last week indicated that 43 offices will be closed. It is interesting that 17 offices are to be closed in New South Wales, and nearly 80 per cent of those offices are in Labor electorates. This very political decision by the government says: `If you vote Labor, you do not deserve services.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in Labor electorates are less likely to have access to transport and their income tends to be lower than that of people who live on the North Shore and in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, and yet it is the people in the Labor electorates who have been most adversely affected by these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been considerable disquiet, certainly in my electorate, about these changes. On 17 May, a rally was organised at Leichhardt Market Town, with the support of the local council and the local state member, Sandra Nori, the member for Port Jackson. I participated, along with the workers&mdash;about to be non&hyphen;workers&mdash;of the Leichhardt Medicare office. That rally was well attended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was another rally on 17 August last year at the Marrickville Road Medicare office, organised by myself and Dr Andrew Refshauge, the New South Wales Minister for Health and Deputy Premier. At that stage, it had not been indicated that the Leichhardt office would be closed. I invite the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), who is at the table, to the rally which is being held on 3 July at the Marrickville Road Medicare office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been organised by me and other members of the community, with the support of the local Marrickville council, and the state member, Dr Andrew Refshauge. I invite the minister to come to Marrickville, to downgrade himself and come to an area which, whilst it has some economic difficulties, is an area that I am proud to be associated with. I am sure the minister would get a very interesting welcome to that electorate, especially when he tells the people that their Medicare office is being replaced by a fax machine in a pharmacy somewhere up the road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opposition to these office closures does not just come from the people directly affected. The closure of a government office in a strip shopping centre takes away business from the other shops in that area, because the people who go to the Medicare office to get their rebates or whatever will not be going there. A lot of concern has been expressed to me by small businesses in both Marrickville and Leichhardt about the negative impact that these changes will have on their business. That is symptomatic of a government which is reducing services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also flies in the face of the commitment that this government made during the election campaign that there would not be any attacks on Medicare. There is no doubt that closures of Medicare offices, in conjunction with the massive cuts to health funding and pharmaceuticals, which the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) has highlighted here tonight, all add up to a major attack by this government on the public health system. It should be noted that New South Wales in particular has suffered in terms of public health funding. It would appear that it has been penalised for having a Labor government, just as people in the western suburbs of Sydney are being penalised for voting Labor at the last federal election. I am sure, with responses such as this, they will continue to do just that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two more issues that I particularly want to raise in this debate tonight. The first one is the removal of particular areas of health concern from the Commonwealth to the states and territories. In saying that, I note that two particular
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5742"> programs&mdash;the immunisation program and the Aboriginal sexual health program&mdash;are to be retained by the Commonwealth. That is fine and I do not have a problem with that. There are very obvious reasons, particularly in relation to the immunisation program and the great debate around that, as to why that has been done and why it is a good decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I really wonder how a government makes it decisions in this area. I understand that programs such as the cervical cancer program, the breast screening program, the national drug strategy, the HIV/Aids strategy and the national women's health program are all going to be allowed to slip through to the states and territories. I have serious concerns about this government's attitude about the role between it and the community when it looks at the way in which it wishes to govern and in which it wishes to deliver services to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are certain areas that I believe should either be retained by the Commonwealth or should only go through to the states and territories under very strict circumstances because of the need for equality of access to service and for equality of delivery and level of service that is going out to the community. I question very sincerely why this government can make a decision to retain certain programs and not others. Is it because some are more important? Is it because some are more sexy out there in the community? What is it that makes a Commonwealth government decide that it is going to retain its role with the immunisation program but it is not going to retain the same level of role with cervical cancer or breast screening or the HIV/Aids strategy? I would like to hear some detail on how this particular area of the government's health portfolio operates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want also to quickly touch on&mdash;and this was brought up earlier tonight&mdash;the issue of nursing homes. In the debate in the House, in the detailed stage of the particular bill and the budget decisions that surround it, there was a great deal of screaming and carry&hyphen;on from the government benches about our shadow minister and our side of politics running scare campaigns. I feel very strongly about that accusation. I had the opportunity the other day, and I repeat it here, to say that the comments coming to me&mdash;as a federal member in this parliament representing a constituency from the ACT&mdash;were coming not from my shadow minister but from the community. I want to talk about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who were presenting their views, concerns and worries about the whole implication of this strategy include Aged Care Australia; the Mirinjani Retirement Village at Weston, which is within the ACT; the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, speaking on behalf of the Alzheimer's Association Australia; the Australian Council of Social Service; the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation; Baptist Care Australia; Churches of Christ Network of Aged Care Services; the Salvation Army; Community Services Australia, and the Uniting Church. I also had direct representations from the Aged Services Association of New South Wales and the ACT, and the Churches of Christ Homes and Community Services Incorporated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for my bringing this up is quite clear: we were not running a scare campaign at all and we are not now. We are attempting to reflect to the government, through the appropriation debate, the concerns from people at an incredibly high level out there in the community who service those who require access to nursing homes. I am dealing right now with a constituent&mdash;in fact, I have had two conversations with her today&mdash;who is desperately trying to get access to a nursing home. Her overriding concerns are about how all of these future implications will impact on her family.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5743">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also had discussions with people within the ACT who are going to be able to leave a nursing home, because they have been inappropriately housed up until now, and they are younger people. They are trying to make sure in this program being offered to them, where they can exit that nursing home, that should they find, after being in there for some years, that the transition was not as favourable as they wished they could re&hyphen;enter. They have been told that they probably can, but only if they pay the up&hyphen;front fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of myth and a lot of misunderstanding in the community, but also an enormous amount of fear. I think the fear is very well&hyphen;founded. Do not blame us for it. Go to the community and talk to them. They are the ones who are coming to me and telling me what they think of this particular decision.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also would like to bring to the attention of the minister the concern that is being expressed in my community over the cutting back of the family resource centres. It was not something that was advertised; it was not something that you were all of a sudden told was going to happen. You had to read through line by line, item by item, of the budget papers to find out that the 11 family resource centres throughout Australia, which were originally set up in 1991 as a Labor initiative in some of the most disadvantaged areas in Australia, were going to have their funding done away with. In fact, they have all been told that that funding has to cease as of December this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You wonder why, when you look at what is happening with domestic violence, particularly domestic violence against women of non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds; at what is happening with drug and alcohol abuse, which is a topic very dear to my heart; and certainly what is happening with unemployment. In an area like mine, it seems that we have all of these things against us. When we have a service that is helping to coordinate help for people and to assist people affected by these problems, it's difficult to see that being taken away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just another harsh decision that this government has taken without realising the long&hyphen;term ramifications. It is not just some little group of people who are buried away in an area that people do not have access to. These are very organised people who are concerned, who are out there working in the community, coordinating and putting programs into place. In my area in particular, I found it ironic that after the decision to cut family resource centres, including the centre in my electorate, which we call Ettinger House because of the historic place they operate out of&mdash;the very week when we were objecting to these cuts, the Minister for Family Services, the honourable Judith Moylan, actually came out and opened an ethnic Chinese nursing home. It was the completed product, but what is interesting is that the very first line of putting together the application for the nursing home occurred when a group of Australians of Chinese descent, who wanted to provide for their aged, went to Ettinger House, which in turn helped them fill in their application and showed them how to go about getting funding. Then, when all of that was done, we put it forward to the minister of the day, saying that we would like funding to go ahead for that group of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just one of the many examples I could relate, time and time again in this parliament, of what has been achieved since that resource centre has been operating in our area. In fact, when it was first mentioned the council welcomed it so much that they even provided the finance for it for the first 12 months while it was getting put together and before the government took over the payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a centre that is not just a few wishful people sitting around a cup of coffee in a corner. This is a centre that is operating both effectively and efficiently. It is saving the government
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5744"> just in the type of hands&hyphen;on service it is able to provide. Yet we see in this budget that not just my centre in Fairfield but the 11 resource centres across Australia are going to go by the wayside. I do not think enough investigation was done into that and I hope the people in the Senate, when they are considering the budget, will consider that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to add that my electorate is suffering again in the cuts to the Medicare centres. We are actually losing one in Cabramatta and one in Merrylands. In an electorate like mine that basically means that something like 500,000 people are going to be treated to one Medicare office in Fairfield itself&mdash;and the queues are out the door now. A lot of those people are from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds and the staff, who are superb, have to help them fill in the forms and show them what to do. There is going to be nothing else in all the area from Liverpool to Parramatta except the one in Fairfield. We are closing down the other two. It is absolutely appalling. This is an area where we need growth in these types of facilities, which are required, and what do we do? We are shutting them down. Where do these people turn to? Do you think they are going to go to a pharmacist and fax away a rebate form? Most of the people who go through my Medicare offices now are there waiting for the payment to come back. I know we have one of the largest bulk billing areas in a community like mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But those who have got to pay that money up front cannot wait for another week or two weeks for it to come back. That is why a lot of them take their forms in personally so that they can put them over the counter. They can be assisted by the staff there, and they can wait and get their payments. It may not mean a lot to this minister or this government. But believe me, in a community like mine that extra $15, $18 or $20 means a lot for that mother to go home with. She realises then that she can pick up the bread and the milk and the stuff for the kids on the way home because she has got that little bit more money back in her pocket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not going to happen now. She is going to have to wait in the queues that are already accumulating out through the doors on that one particular service. Previously, they had the possibility of going to other offices in the area. Now that has been denied them. How many more cuts are we going to see for people that live in western Sydney? It is the largest population growth area in all of Australia, I daresay, with the largest growth, too, in the number of first settlers coming in&mdash;52 per cent of my electorate was born overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not saying that they are the most literate people in the English language. They are not. They need these services. We welcome these legal migrants to the country&mdash;I am not talking about the illegal ones&mdash;and yet we are taking the services from underneath them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) alluded to the closure of the 11 FRCs around Australia. In the budget papers the item that refers to it&mdash;and it is not an item in the appropriations&mdash;is in budget paper no. 2, page 7, where it mentions broadbanding other family and children services for 1997&hyphen;98, minus $3 million; and for 1998&hyphen;99 minus $6.4 million, with $6.6 million and $6.8 million in the out years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether we need some sort of cipher to work out what these code things are, but when you go to page 78 of this document to get the fuller explanation, it does not even mention FRCs. It talks about consolidation of a number of other programs. It is just a real worry that here is a government that has come in saying that they want to have transparency in their budget documents, and things like that, and it is just so difficult to work out what is going on.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5745">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The item I now want to turn to is an issue that has got legs since about last Friday and that is the defunding of the Family Planning Association and the Australian Pensioners Superannuants Federation. These were organisations funded under the Community Sector Support Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later on, in response, I hope that the minister (Dr Wooldridge) can clarify what is actually really going on here because if one goes to the appropriations, it would appear on my reading of the appropriations that in 1996&hyphen;97 the estimated actual is $6.355 million. The appropriation for this year's budget, 1997&hyphen;98, is $4.987 million, a 22 per cent decrease. I want to make sure that I have got the facts right on that because if that is correct, then the explanation that the minister gave in his interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> on Friday and the explanations that the minister representing in the Senate has given in a couple of questions yesterday, are inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the point that the minister put in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> interview that he had four or five organisations, as I understand it, receiving seeding grants that have now gone to a fuller form of funding. But one has to ask why those two organisations that have substantially been defunded have been picked out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it transpires, it appears that a Coopers &amp; Lybrand study that was commissioned by the government did not, in fact, recommend the defunding of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, so this is a decision of the government. But it would be interesting to have fully explained the reasons that the Coopers &amp; Lybrand report cannot be made public because if it was important in the decision making of government, it should be important in the public discussion of the defunding because legitimately, there can be suspicion about why those two organisations were defunded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is legitimate to ask whether the defunding of the Family Planning Association is something that has been a requirement on the government because of the discussions with a certain independent senator. Likewise, with the defunding of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, is it because the federation has been harsh in its criticism of certain items? The honourable member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) mentioned that organisation as one that had been critical of the nursing home decision. It is legitimate to ask these questions as there might be legitimate answers that can quell the fears that people have. I think the minister would agree that these organisations have an important role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer with a bit of modesty to a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">You have your moments</EMPHASIS>. The chair was the member for Scullin at the time&mdash;this was back in February 1991 so it is a dusty document. The committee recommended continued Commonwealth funding for national secretariats of non&hyphen;government health, housing and community service organisations on the basis that public education, public debate and community consultation assist the development of appropriate policies and programs, especially where disadvantaged groups are concerned. I think that that still stands and I am not saying that the government does not recognise that.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons for the defunding appears to be that, as the minister has said, there are two other organisations that are well placed&mdash;I am not sure whether he is saying better placed&mdash;to convey the thoughts of people who have interests in aged care or aged people themselves. I would think that if it has been satisfactory to have this diversity of view, including that of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, then that should continue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5746">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister may have a problem because he believes that, because that organisation takes up issues of social security and the like, it is outside of his portfolio. That was why I read the recommendation which was couched in terms of the government having an obligation. I believe the government cannot run away from seeing that it has an obligation to organisations such as this one, and that it should take a whole of government approach. The spokesperson for that association has said&mdash;I believe that most members would acknowledge this point&mdash;that income support is very important to the health of any sector of the community. To dismiss continuing funding for this organisation on the basis that it takes interest in social security matters is a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the real thing that I want to get clarified is whether the underlying reason that these two organisations have been defunded, besides the suspicion that they might in some way be being punished, is that the funding for this program has been reduced by over a fifth. If that is the case, we will have things trotted out that say that it is the previous government's fault, et cetera, which, of course, is an absolute nonsense. But let us get it on the record so that we can clearly identify the commitment of the government to this program. I am quite happy to have it explained that I have got the wrong end of those figures. It is a one&hyphen;line item. It is an appropriation in Appropriation Bill (No. 1)&mdash;I think it is 340 2.02. That 22 per cent reduction needs to be explained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, this portfolio has a smorgasbord of issues that one could raise. I am quite satisfied that a number of the issues that I would have raised have been raised by my colleagues, whether it be the issue that the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) raised, which affects my electorate, about the closure of the Reservoir Medicare office, or whether it be the discussions that we have had about nursing homes and aged care. The honourable member for Batman reminds me of the closure of the Heidelberg Medicare office, very important for the overall scope and coverage of Medicare offices in the region. I think it is perhaps a bit disconcerting that we have had this debate in the way that we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that from time to time the honourable member for Batman's behaviour either in the chamber or in the Main Committee is a bit disconcerting, but he reminds me of an issue about the Medicare closures. The simple fact is that the statistics show that six out of the eight closures in Victoria were in Labor&hyphen;held seats&mdash;six out of eight. Given the circumstances of the electorates we hold, that is a very important thing to expose and to keep reminding the minister of. It is also a fact that, on the occasions when I have tried to get a greater coverage of Medicare offices and an office in the city of Whittlesea, responses have been couched in terms of it being the HIC's problem. It is clear that, on this occasion, the minister interfered in the decision&hyphen;making process. Let us not get into the nonsense that it was actually the commission's decision: it very much had direct government involvement.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member who spoke previously, my colleague the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), reminded me that the newsletter that just came from the Alcohol and Drug Council of Australia pointed out that all public health funding had now collapsed into a one&hyphen;line appropriation. The ADCA is concerned because decisions have not even been made yet as to how much is going to be allocated to HIV/AIDS, national drugs strategy, diabetes, et cetera. One of their other concerns affects an area like mine, in that there is a major initiative which will involve removing methadone from the Medicare scheme and replacing this form of Commonwealth funding with a set payment through a specified cost&hyphen;shared funding scheme. Trials of the new arrangements will take place this year, and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5747"> methadone is due to be removed from Medicare in November 1998. This measure is expected to save the government around $19 million over four years. What a cheap saving that is!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of this country announced&mdash;if my memory serves me correctly, it was on 5 June&mdash;a program of something like $13 million at a federal level over three or four years to look at domestic violence and associated crime&mdash;this without looking at what is causing domestic violence and crime in this country. At the same time, it is estimated that nearly $4 billion is being collected in this budget with excise and taxes on alcohol and on tobacco. Yet, in the same budget, we find&mdash;again, through press releases put out by the very reputable Alcohol and Drug Council people&mdash;that something like only $33 million out of that $4 billion is being put back into a drug education strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you take that one step further, you find that the $33 million that is going back into the national drug strategy program for education amounts to less than $2 per person throughout Australia. In other words, that is how much we think about the 500 lives that are being lost every year in this country through heroin overdose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently had a private member's motion in the House, and there was even a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Witness</EMPHASIS> program last night, concerning drug deaths and what they mean to the families and to the community. It is a theme I have been pushing for quite some time, as you realise, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I will use the opportunity given to me tonight to again appeal to the minister. I know that in the questions I have had on the notice paper that both he and the Prime Minister have said, `You want a national drug summit, but that is actually a waste of resources and a waste of time.' What price do we put on human life? What price do we put on it when we can take $4 billion in revenue and yet give only $33 million back to the National Drug Strategy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that when we are talking about the cost of human lives we have to relate those human lives to our own areas. I know for a fact that something like 44 heroin deaths occurred in 1995 in my electorate due to heroin overdoses. In the very week that I was speaking about this particular topic in the parliament, three more people lost their lives in Cabramatta, which is part of my community. I know these people may not have parents who are as articulate as some of the other parents who are now taking up their cause, but they are still someone's brother or sister or husband or son or daughter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have got to start caring; people have got to start caring when they see that so many of the young people in the electorate are being affected. People have got to start caring when they see that 11 per cent of 13&hyphen;year&hyphen;old kids in one of the high schools in my electorate have already tried heroin. Yet I hear from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) that we do not need a national drug summit and that it is a waste of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sit and try to talk to people. The experts all have different opinions. I have not got the answers, and so I say, `Why not bring the experts of Australia together? Why not bring all the states, the medical people, the police and the judiciary together? Why not bring together the community workers, the church workers, the families, and even the drug users? Put them all in an area together and say, `Let's work something out.' Obviously, what we have done in the past has failed. We have people still dying on the street; yet we are able, in our health budget, to make cuts in areas at the same time that an overall budget is reaping extra billions of dollars.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5748">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Action has got to be taken at this level here and now. It is a national problem. For a national problem we need a national solution. And to get a national solution we need a national summit. We cannot say to a community, `It's your problem; we're going to walk away from it'; to the states, `It's your problem; we're going to walk away from it.' It is Australia's problem. It is a medical problem. It has to be treated as a medical problem. It can only happen if we get the Prime Minister of this country taking the leadership role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appeal again to the minister in the chair. You have got to look at where we are going in this particular regard. It is not just me as a backbencher in the opposition calling for a national drug summit. You have got most of the Directors of Public Prosecution around Australia. You now have the AMA putting out their figures saying 1,182 people died last year from drugs and drug&hyphen;related illnesses. They are saying that the only way you are going to overcome it&mdash;the minister was a member of the AMA&mdash;is to bring the experts together and let us have a national drug summit.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. One more really important issue that I would like to discuss here briefly tonight is the question of youth suicide and the ongoing funding that has occurred in previous, current and hopefully, future budgets. I say hopefully; in fact I know that it will be continuing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple message that I want to bring to this debate tonight in relation to the funding of this program is this: the previous government had a commitment, roughly $13 million over four years, that began in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget for a program called Here for Life. My figuring now is that we have entered the third of the four years of that program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the current government bringing in a new program last year with continuing funding this year, called the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy, of $19 million. I am a member of a committee in this place that has recently brought down a summary report on this subject, which was tabled in the House recently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we consider the expenditure of the these funds I implore the minister to consider certain factors. It is imperative in my view that the previous government's program and the current government's programs are somehow linked, reflected or learned from. There seems to me to be a great risk that the allocation of the current funding through to the new program appears to be getting, to some degree, done in isolation from the earlier one. I would be happy to be contradicted on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There also seems to be, again in my view, a lack of, or a very low level of, funding through to the educational level. When I talk about that what I am meaning is that for the appropriate data to be available for any government to carry out a sincere approach to the question of youth suicide we really need much more detailed national collective data than we have. It is all very well for us to understand that, for argument's sake, young men in rural areas commit suicide at a higher rate than, say, young men in other areas. But we do not really understand to any great detail why. We know the symptoms; we can have experts give us the symptoms. But we really do not have that detailed data that I think should be had to that level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing is the need to recognise the signs of depression, particularly in our young people. Are we putting enough money and effort into our schools, into our counselling services, through to our GPs and our general community nursing areas so that they are actually taught to see and are advised to look for the appropriate signs, so that they can see what is going to happen in front of them?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5749">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most appalling statistics in the whole of the debate of the question of youth suicide, or suicide generally, is that I understand that 60 per cent of those people who eventually succeed in the act of suicide have in fact tried it before. We really need to question what we are doing wrong in terms of follow&hyphen;up, counselling, recognition and understanding that we allow that 60 per cent who have tried it once or twice earlier and failed to eventually achieve that end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should look at this in a constructive fashion. I am not saying any of these comments in a particularly biased view. The committee that I am on really approached this subject from a very broad base of consensus. We all agreed across the board that we needed to do something desperately. But what I am saying is that from my perspective, from what I have observed and what I heard, these areas really need to be addressed. Are there enough school counsellors out there? Are we going to have a whole of government approach sufficient to attack this problem? Are we going to isolate it only into certain areas? Are we going to be able to say, within the health area, for argument's sake, that an effect within the education area is going to be recognised? Are we really going to put enough into youth services? Are we taking enough consideration of youth homelessness, youth unemployment and all of the other pressures that we have?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the previous speaker was talking about drugs, are we looking at that? Are we taking enough into consideration from the mental health area? Are we looking at whether or not our services in addressing mental health are, in any way, contributing to the question of youth suicide? These are the things that need to be looked at carefully, holistically, across government and nationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that there is and has been, between the previous government and the current one, a huge amount of effort and money going into it. What I am suggesting is that we need to take a very deep breath and look very carefully at how we are expending those funds so that we really understand what it is we are attempting to attack and then direct those funds in the most precise fashion that we can, given the difficulty of the subject at hand.</PARA></SPEECH>

This debate has gone on for some time and I do have to leave. If there are any subsequent contributions, I will make sure they are addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of members have put forward queries and that is right and proper. This committee stage has been very useful. The first contribution was from the member for Calare (Mr Andren) who talked about aged care. It did seem to me that he was more canvassing issues that were in the Aged Care Bill. He talked about uncertainty relating to accommodation bonds and the amount for disadvantaged customers of $5 a day. I think a lot of that uncertainty about accommodation bonds has now been removed. I just make the point that our costings on $5 a day, as I understand it, actually give homes more than they are currently receiving today. Obviously, people will always ask for more. That is one thing I have learnt in 15 months in government: I have not ever found anyone who has said the amount of money they get is enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) talked about therapeutic premiums predominantly in her first contribution and said that it was going to deny people access to the latest and safest
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5750"> medications. This is not actually correct. One of the reasons we are doing it is so that people can get the latest and safest medications. We are talking about medications such as Verpamil, which has been available certainly for 20 years and probably for 30 years. I say 20 years because I can remember it had been around for some years when I started medical school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is merely its size. It is already about 1&half; times the budget of the state of Tasmania and, in spite of all the changes we are making, next year alone we will spend $300 million more on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme than we did last year. The difficulty is that what we inherited was increasing at 15&half; per cent per year without taking into account new drugs coming on to the market. That meant something that is 1&half; times the budget of the state of Tasmania is doubling in cost every four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have new drugs coming on board. One I am dealing with at the moment is Lanzapeen for schizophrenia. It is a particularly high&hyphen;cost drug that I am hoping to be able to bring onto the system. If I am going to find the resources to bring these new latest and safest medications on, I have to have a system that is able to afford that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therapeutic premiums are really an extension of what we have had now for seven years with generics. I do remember some of the claims that were made&mdash;and I have to say they were made by the government when in opposition&mdash;about what generic pricing would do. Most of those claims proved not to be correct. This sort of scheme already exists in a number of overseas countries, particularly Holland, Germany and New Zealand. It has not caused any of the great problems that people have suggested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Namadgi talked about the AMA opposing it. That is about my benchmark for good policy. I think if the AMA opposes it, I am probably doing the right thing. The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia said it is necessary to monitor the changes and I agree with them. I do not wish to do anything that is going to cause people difficulty and we will be monitoring them too. With the experience we have had in those overseas countries, I do not see that there is going to be a great problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Namadgi also asked for detailed arrangements. We did, short of giving out the spreadsheets, give as much as we could in the Senate estimates, but there is a degree of cabinet-in&hyphen;confidence in these issues. Other than what we have given, where we have tried to be cooperative in Senate estimates, I am afraid I cannot give any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) talked about child-care funding and he gave an example from his own electorate. Child care is not my area, but I have been passed a note that it is difficult to see the justification for the fee increases he talked about. I note that he blamed the removal of the operational subsidy for the fee increases and I just note that that has not even come into effect yet. Therefore, it is a bit hard to see how the child-care centre could be blaming something that has not happened for a fee increase that clearly happened some time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fee increases quoted are for a single parent with one child, studying full&hyphen;time, and therefore needing care five days a week. It would appear to reflect a grossly unfair charging practice where parents studying and requiring part-time care are being charged for full&hyphen;time care. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> Perhaps the honourable member's constituents should look at fees in private services which are significantly lower, do not get the operational subsidy, have never done so, and where standards there are protected through the community based services as well as by the child care accreditation system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5751">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) talked about the PBS and the government having taken $700 million out of it last year and $500 million next year. I think I have addressed that in the broad. She talked about a figure of $9 a script for her pensioners. I would be utterly confident none of her pensioners would have to be paying that amount. Again, experience overseas is that the majority of these savings come from the pharmaceutical companies and not from the pockets of the patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), again on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, as was the member for Prospect, talked about it not suiting certain patients in particular circumstances. This is why we have not made a definitive decision on what is or is not in the categories. That is why I am asking a group of experts&mdash;the Pharmaceutical Benefit Advisory Committee, a completely non-partisan committee appointed on the basis of expertise&mdash;to determine what should and should not be in and to have a look at the particular circumstances that he states. He rejects that it will create competition. Well, I say that it will and by February 1999 we will know who is right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) talked about his Medicare offices in Leichhardt and Marrickville. It is no fun closing things down, but I do not make an apology for this. I concede that in Victoria and New South Wales there was a predominance of Labor seats where the Medicare offices were closed, but in South Australia and Western Australia and Queensland there was a predominance of coalition seats where Medicare offices were closed. If you take it over the country as a whole, it was about fifty&hyphen;fifty. The criteria that we used was that we had a look where there was another office within 10 kilometres&mdash;that did in some cases go out to 12 kilometres&mdash;and we had a look where there were fewer than 400 claims per day, rather than per week. I might have to be corrected on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made a few exceptions. One exception was the office in St Ives in the seat of the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) which had the largest claims of any office we closed. We also left open one in Queensland that was slightly less than 12 kilometres away. That was also in a coalition seat. So one was an adverse event, one was a positive event, and both were coalition seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that the decision was mine in the end, and that is the nature of these decisions. Of the original list the Health Insurance Commission gave to me, I accepted most of the recommendations. Some recommendations that I did not accept were in both Labor and coalition seats. I generally did not accept recommendations on the basis of strong support from a local member&mdash;and members on both sides of the House had put positions to me&mdash;and on distance. Initially, they were suggesting that some offices up to 20 kilometres from others should be closed, but I was not prepared to accept that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should put it on the record that the whole point of doing this is not cost saving but to try to provide a greater resource for people in country areas. I know it will be difficult for some people in city areas, but it is very difficult now for people in country areas. The trials of the new pharmacy claiming that we have run around Townsville have shown it to be incredibly popular. It has had some glitches, but the trial has sorted them out. As we further expand that around rural Australia, we will be giving rural areas something, where before they had absolutely nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the information of the member for Grayndler, the Marrickville office had 127 claims per day, which is low, and it was eight kilometres from the next nearest office. The Leichhardt
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5752"> office had 286 claims per day and was 4.9 kilometres from the next nearest office. That was the basis on which those closures were made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Grayndler also talked about workers about to become non&hyphen;workers. I should put it on the record that this is being done in such a manner that no&hyphen;one will be retrenched and people will be redeployed within the system. The member for Grayndler talked about cuts in health funding as an attack on Medicare. The changes we have made have been to preserve Medicare, and that is something that the public understands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Namadgi talked about programs under the broadbanding of the public health agreement. I suspect that she does not actually understand what we are trying to do, which I take as my responsibility. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> It clearly has not been adequately explained up to this point in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two programs she mentioned&mdash;the immunisation program and the Aboriginal sexual health program&mdash;are retained by the Commonwealth because they are new. They are starting de novo. They have needed Commonwealth leadership to get up and running. That is the simple reason why those two programs have a significant Commonwealth element.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ones that she mentioned&mdash;breast screening, HIV&hyphen;AIDS, cervical cancer&mdash;are part of the new public health agreements we are looking to sign with the states. That does not mean that the Commonwealth will not be having an involvement in public health. The fact is, any objective review of what has happened in the last 14 months would show that we have done pretty well in the public health area. I have tried to make it a big focus of my time as minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in the end, to have rigid demarcation between the Commonwealth and the states means that we may not be delivering the most flexible and most appropriate services. I have absolutely no intention of letting the states walk away from these programs, but for me to actually prescribe day to day, place to place, bed to bed, X&hyphen;ray machine to X&hyphen;ray machine how these might work, does not give a chance to integrate the federal and state systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that bedevils the health system, as it did under the previous government, is the jurisdictional problems between the Commonwealth and the states. I am trying to do something about it. It is difficult; I accept that. There is always criticism, but if people are being fair, they will realise that ministers on both sides have talked about this for decades. Now that we are actually trying to do something, it would be helpful to have a bit of support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Namadgi then went on to talk about nursing homes. They are probably covered in the previous comments. I understand that the community is worried. I suggest she says to her constituents, `Remember the system we introduced into hostels in 1987? This is just an extension of that. It has worked very well in hostels, and the reason it is being done is because of the $1 billion shortfall in capital funding that the Gregory report showed was the net result of 10 years of administration by the Labor Party. So it really is a pretty good idea.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Prospect talked about her Medicare offices. Cabramatta has a very low number of claims&mdash;70 claims a day, which is one of the lowest in Australia. It got knocked out on that basis. Merrylands was 287, which was still a fair bit below the 400 cut&hyphen;off, and there is another office 3.5 kilometres away. Again, I accept that that will cause some inconvenience to her constituents, and for that I am sorry. The people in country areas who have to travel 40 or 50 kilometres will be fairly happy, though.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5753">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Scullin talked about the CSSS program and I am happy to discuss that. Off the top of my head, if he goes back to last year's budget papers he will find that the drop&hyphen;off in the forward estimates was because of decisions made last year, not this year. There was no change to the CSSS in this year's budget. As I understand it, the changes were last year's. The change in funding he is talking about is something that would have appeared in last year's budget paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exercise we went through in looking at the funding of certain organisations has been cost neutral. It has not saved us any money at all. There were a couple of reasons why I wanted to do that. The first was that I have actually increased the funding of level 3 organisations fairly substantially&mdash;from $108,000 per year to $125,000 per year. The majority on that are pretty happy. I think $108,000 really is a bit too little to run any sort of national secretariat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue was we just had to change priorities, and I accept that that is difficult. I would say to the honourable member that we actually defunded more than just the two that he raises&mdash;it was not as if they were the only ones singled out; perhaps they are the only ones that have been screaming so far&mdash;and we did fund a number of new organisations, which are ones that are very worthwhile. Given that money is finite, I have made a decision that I am putting a priority with carers, with volunteers, with heart support, and an organisation that really was on its last legs after it had been defunded, after its seed funding ran out, by the previous government&mdash;Asthma. They are things that are very relevant to my portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Pensioners and Superannuants Federation have done a good job. I accept that. But their predominant focus is not in the health area, it is in the income support area. They do do some work in health, but I had to make the decision that Asthma, heart, carers and volunteers were of a higher priority. I will obviously have to live with that decision. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The honourable member for Scullin then went on to suggest that it might relate to discussions with a certain senator. If he saw the full range of organisations defunded, I would suspect he would not, because we also stopped funding to the Natural Family Planning Secretariat as well. I understand paranoia might be a normal state in politics, but I can assure him it did not relate to anything in another place. He addressed the issue of a majority in Victoria being closed, I accept that. But if he looks at the criteria on which it is done and the criteria that I mentioned, he will see why that happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Prospect talked about the methadone program. I suspect she does not understand this aspect of what we are doing, because I wonder if she would take the same position if she did. The fact is that there are a small number of people, predominantly psychiatrists, who are ripping the system off, to an extraordinary amount of money, through the prescription of methadone. The fact is that methadone will still be available through chemists, it will still be available through health based services, and the people who will lose out of this will not be the people who need methadone, it will be the psychiatrists who are making three&hyphen;quarters of a million bucks a year by doing nothing but doling out methadone&mdash;and this does happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke about this to a very senior person in one state, who is a psychiatrist, and this person's comment was, `It does not worry me at all. We don't have that rort in this state.' So it did have to end, but I can assure you I am supportive of community based methadone, particularly in the way it operates through pharmacists, and I have ensured that that has continued.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5754">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the member for Namadgi talked at length about youth suicide. I have to say I agree with her. I think the programs that we run do have to have a focus on what works and what does not, we do have to trial a range of projects, we do have to be honest, and we do have to try and build on what has been done previously, rather than start things anew. I hope that is the method we will be pursuing.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has to go, although I recognise he has been here for some time, because there are a number of important issues which relate to my local area which I would like to raise tonight. One in particular is the question of the defunding of the national family resource centre program, particularly the South&hyphen;Eastern Resource Action Centre in my area. The minister has undertaken to take on board what is said from now on and I hope he will have a look at this issue. I look forward to a situation where he will answer this himself at a later time, or refer it on to the Minister for Family Services, the honourable Judy Moylan, for a direct response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to commence by reading from a letter from SERAC, from the Acting Chairperson, Janet L. Casey, which I think encapsulates the key aspects of this issue very well. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I write on behalf of the Committee of Management of SERAC Incorporated to seek your support in overturning a decision to remove all funding for this program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 14th May, 1997&mdash;the day following the Federal Government's 1997/98 Budget,&mdash;SERAC learned that the funding for the FRC Program would be "reallocated". Subsequent advice from the Department of Health &amp; Family Services (DHFS), in Canberra, confirmed proposals to defund all FRCs on 31st December, 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No specific mention of Family Resource Centres was made in the Budget papers. Hidden away on page 124 of the Budget papers was the mention of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"Broadbanding other family &amp; children's services"</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister's letter to SERAC explained the decision was designed "to achieve efficiencies and redirect funding to Government priorities. . . ..the Government has decided to refocus funding for the eleven (11) FRCs to broaden the existing networks that provide direct support to families in over 90 disadvantaged areas currently supported by <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Youth Activity Services</EMPHASIS> ."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DHFS notified the FRC Network that the "refocussed" allocation to YAS is planned to be <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">$2.5 million</EMPHASIS> , expected to be tagged to the employment of family support workers. The FRC budget was $4.7 million+, <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">so should we assume that the Government is also aiming for savings of at least $2.2 million?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth DHFS also funds the YAS program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"to provide young people aged 11&hyphen;16 years, with structured activities and positive peer supports outside school hours, to help prevent them developing patterns of destructive behaviour"</EMPHASIS> . SERAC agrees that expanding funding to direct youth services is a worthy initiative, but in our view this should not occur at the expense of the FRCs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At various times since the Budget, Government ministers and local MPs have attempted to argue that Youth Activities Services can do the work of FRCs. This is in fact incorrect. Members of the National FRC Network have come to the conclusion that the proposal to de&hyphen;fund FRCs was taken because key decision makers in the government were not fully briefed on the positive work of the FRCs and the high level of community support for the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some local Liberal MPs have publicly defended their Government's decision with arguments that are not supported by any documentation or feedback received by SERAC, to date:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the program was designed to run for 5 years only, and this time is now up</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that FRCs were designed only to co&hyphen;ordinate welfare services &amp; there is no longer any real need for them</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> existing agents can now manage without the FRCs
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5755">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government made the decision in 1991 to establish such Centres in areas of locational disadvantage as part of a national strategy to improve the effectiveness and accessibility of services for families. This particular centre services Dandenong, Casey and Cardinia&mdash;one of the fastest growing outer urban areas in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">national potentials</EMPHASIS>  of this small program may not be recognised by the current Government in Canberra, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">positive impacts of this program at local levels are significant</EMPHASIS> . In SERACs case, I particularly mention the detailed research conducted by this Centre and promotion of strategies to improve service delivery to families in our catchment <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(particularly for the most disadvantaged families, adolescents and children)</EMPHASIS> ; also SERACs effective facilitation of a co&hyphen;ordinated and forward thinking approach to social planning for local communities in this outer urban growth area. The closure of this Centre and the National Program can only be seen as short sighted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Council for Social Services</EMPHASIS>  commented that the abolition of funding to Family Resource Centres was "very damaging", saying further that "Family Resource Centres play a vital role in providing back&hyphen;up support to direct service providers." . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At the request of SERAC, I urge the minister to respond to th questions that have been raised in this letter. This is a serious issue. The activities of SERAC, which I will speak of again at a later stage, have played a crucial role in the coordination of services in the local area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That in itself will, over time&mdash;and has over time&mdash;save money in the local area by ensuring that services are properly focused and, therefore, that services are provided on the most cost&hyphen;effective basis. Part of what they are about is trying to make sure that families get a proper go in their local areas. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Centres such as SERAC are very popular in their local areas. I would like to pick up again on comments made locally and the responses that I have received from the local community. I have here a letter from the Narre Warren Station Primary School, which was in my electorate under the previous boundaries. The letter is from the school principal, Mr Dick Turner. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Alan,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Re</EMPHASIS> : Funding of <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> Family Resource Centre</EMPHASIS>  Program, in particular the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> South East Resource Action Centre</EMPHASIS> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I represented this community on the Committee of Management of SERAC in 1995/96. SERAC is a unique community support service that works with other vital agencies through three Local Government Areas. The LGAs are extremely diverse, from established suburbs experiencing regeneration from recently arrived migrant groups through to outer&hyphen;urban growth corridor development where infrastructure is inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I really want you to know how disappointed I am that this highly valued and efficient organisation is threatened with the funding axe. I almost believed that the Howard Government was a bit serious about family values. There is intense pressure on social cohesiveness in this part of Australia and the costs of family dislocation augur for long&hyphen;term damage and taxpayer expense. I would have thought that the innovative and proactive nature of SERAC is the Commonwealth Government's best hope of recovering the difficulties already evident in this community, and developing effective planning and efficient service response strategies for the future.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SERAC is a highly co&hyphen;ordinated, sophisticated and hi&hyphen;tech vital cog in the networking of local agencies and all levels of government in this region. It surprises me that advisors of The Hon Judi Moylan are insufficiently informed about, or insensitive to the importance of SERAC, and have failed to draw these matters to the Minister's attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accountability and integrity of SERAC to the local community and to the Commonwealth Government are exemplary in terms of democratic best practice and any assessment of SERAC's operations would show how cost&hyphen;effective it is.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The fact is that the sorts of reports that SERAC has been producing over the last few years have been enormously important to local government and to other non&hyphen;government service
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5756"> providers in the local area trying to ensure that the dollars that are spent by government are used effectively. That is really the point that has been missed in this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier, the minister spoke about the need to make decisions around the question of choices on the basis of having a limited cake and a number of different ways in which it requires to be allocated. That is the problem with this decision. Essentially, organisations such as SERAC can play, and have played, a very important role in local areas in order to try to ensure that that cake which needs to be allocated is allocated as fairly and as cost effectively as possible for government in terms of the delivery of services. Others have talked about the question of the need to look at those issues with a sense of concern as to what the real impact is on local areas. That is the sort of thing SERAC also does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we see a decision which, I think, is incredibly short&hyphen;sighted. One criticism of government that has been made for as long as I can remember, and I have been here quite a while, is the question of new programs often being established to deal with particular problems which are serious but after a while, the programs are altered and the circumstances are that the real importance of those programs is lost over time. This is partly done sometimes for a concern with changing priorities. Often we are seeing a situation where in the first place, the understanding and the needs of a community are not fully understood by government and, therefore, decisions are made about the allocation of funds which although at the time make sense, or appear to make sense, in fact, in practical reality, they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why organisations such as this are crucial in terms of ensuring that government dollars are spent effectively. When you look at the question of what will happen in that area and the lack of coordination which will now occur around service delivery, you have to wonder about the real efficiency of this decision in terms of government. What we might see here is a situation where some $4.7 million is saved under a particular program heading under the Department of Family and Human Services but instead, on from that, money being wasted or not used as effectively as it could be in terms of the delivery of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talked earlier about regional development and the need for communities to have an understanding of the issues in their local area and their capacity to be able to influence those issues. We talk about&mdash;as members from the other side often do&mdash;the needs of rural and regional Australia and the fact that communities out there are hurting and that, basically, those communities know the answers and want government to listen. We are seeing here a situation where government has defunded an organisation which has played a crucial role in allowing local communities to articulate and develop responses to what is needed in their local areas. It is a bad decision, and I ask the government to reconsider it. I wish to get an answer on these issues.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief because I realise that time is going to be against me here. I was not going to raise the nursing home legislation, or the bill that has recently been debated because I understood that that was part of the last budget. I know that it only comes into effect on 1 July this year and that they are certainly going to put some other regulations back further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister did raise it in reply to a number of speakers on this side of the debate. When the minister is saying that all these services are going to ask for more money, I would remind him that the Aged Services Association of New South Wales and the ACT that represent, I believe, something like 900 aged care services through New South Wales and the ACT, that they are concerned that the legislation is still not fully explained to the industry out there at
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5757"> large. Not only do they feel that the $5 a day concessional subsidy is a pittance, but the fact is that we have not explained to them and to all the other agencies that are looking after the elderly in these nursing homes how they are going to come into effect and what they are going to have to do from 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I actually did a survey of a number of nursing homes in my electorate and I asked, `Do you understand what it is all about, what it is going to mean?' They said, `We don't know. We haven't got a clue.' I went so far as to question the availability of beds in one particular nursing home and they quite openly said, `We've got three available, but we are not going to give them out until after 1 July because we will get more money for them.' I found that appalling. If the minister wanted to touch on it, we could go a lot further rather than just rehash the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot say that these groups that are providing such wonderful services to our aged people are only after more and more money. They are after some understanding of how this bill will affect them bill is intended to do and after something more realistic than the $5 offered to those patients who are going to go in because they do not have the money available from selling their own homes.</PARA>
