<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I hope that this final preparedness on the part of the government to actually let me be heard in this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> place on this private member's bill, the Plebiscite for an Australian Republic Bill, is an indication that they are having a change of heart and that they are in fact going to support a process which respects what is now very widespread community support for their desire to express an opinion&mdash;unfettered, uncluttered by any manipulation and directly&mdash;on whether or not Australia should have its own head of state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill sets up a process whereby that can occur. The convention process will not permit this. This bill would permit it. It sets in place a process far cheaper than the convention process, using a parliamentary committee to define a question after public consultation, the question then being put directly to the people. It could be done at election time, therefore saving massively on the government's alternative option. It would be a simple question to the Australian people: do you or do you not wish to have an Australian head of state? This is what will determine the character of our constitution&mdash;whether we remain a constitutional monarchy or whether we become a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As each day passes, we are having more and yet more revealed before us in this place of what the government's intentions are in this area. This policy of theirs&mdash;the convention&mdash;was conceived in party disunity with the intention of obfuscation. That is what that proposition of theirs was about at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When that bill ultimately passed through the Senate, the most disappointed person was not amongst us on this side of the House&mdash;upset and concerned though we were at the first breaches of the Australian secret ballot and what has made the Australian system sustainable in terms of public support for our democratic processes. Disappointed though we were, we were not the most disappointed. The most disappointed person was the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He has been wriggling on the spit of this undertaking of his predecessor as leader of the Liberal Party for the last 18 months. It has been on again, off again, and, finally, he hoped the Senate would give him an excuse to make it off again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tandberg got it quite right with that little box cartoon of his which had two Liberal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7614"> Party hacks coming in, waving a flag at him, and saying, `Good news, Prime Minister. We've got our bill through.' But the picture of the Prime Minister was of a very down&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;mouth individual indeed&mdash;as he was. The Prime Minister does not want this discussed.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is going to be discussed, he wants it sullied by confusion as to the legitimacy of the outcome in relation to the ballot. We know that, virtually automatically, two million Australians will be disenfranchised, and therefore no credibility will be given to any particular deliberations. And, if that does not work, he wants to put a dead hand on what ought to be an opportunity for some vibrant, civil debate in this country by the process of his appointments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I knew a little bit more about the appointees, I said the other day that, while they were a set of distinguished Australians, they seemed to be agnostic so we would not know which way they would fall when they came to the convention. We now know a great deal more about the nominees of this government. The youth that he sought to draw from are about as representative of the youth of Australia as my big toe. That is what we have from the other side of the House on the nominees that they have put forward for this convention. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United Kingdom they are described as `young fogies'. This does not apply to all of them, but it applies to an unrepresentative sample of them. And we had a Liberal Party spokesman coming out the other day saying that the nominee from Queensland had in fact been disciplined for rorting in the Liberal Party system in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, this bill is necessary. This bill is the only way in which an honest opinion will be sought from the Australian people; the only way we will get a representative result; the only way what ought to be an exciting, interesting, vibrant debate in our community, in which the community again takes possession of the forms by which it is governed, will actually be delivered. The failure of the government to provide a process for that is one of the many reasons why they now stand condemned in this community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill implements one of the government's important reforms to review of immigration decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions of the bill comprise measures relating to judicial review of immigration decision making which are being removed from the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 which I introduced into this House on 25 June 1997. Although now in a separate bill, there has been no change to these measures and the reform they bring remains part of the government's interrelated package of reforms to merits and judicial review of immigration decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill gives legislative effect to the government's pre&hyphen;election policy commitment that we would restrict access to judicial review in migration matters in all but exceptional circumstances. That commitment was given in light of the extensive merits review rights in the migration area and arose from concerns about the growing cost and incidence of, and delays resulting from, migration litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give effect to the government's commitment, this bill introduces a new judicial review scheme to cover decisions under the Migration Act relating to the ability of non&hyphen;citizens to enter and remain in Australia. The key mechanism in the new scheme is the privative clause provision at new section 474.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The privative clause, and the related provisions, will replace the existing judicial review scheme at part 8 of the Migration Act. Unlike 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7615"> the existing scheme, the new judicial review scheme will also apply to the High Court and not just the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my second reading speech for the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997, I set out how the need for the new judicial review scheme was clearly demonstrated by looking at the history of the existing scheme, how it was operating today and what would happen in the future if it were left untouched. Some of the key points that I made are:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the current judicial review scheme for visa decisions introduced by the previous government in 1994 has not met that government's intention of reducing the volume of cases before the courts; in fact, recourse to the courts is trending upwards despite full and open access by many applicants to heavily subsidised independent merits review by tribunals;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the high level of litigation, particularly by twice refused asylum claimants, cannot remain unchecked&mdash;increased litigation leads to increased costs and delays, and, for those in detention, to a significantly longer period of detention; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> it is hard not to conclude that there is a substantial number who are using the legal process primarily in order to extend their stay in Australia, especially given that just less than half of all applicants withdraw from legal proceedings before hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stated in the earlier second reading speech, in the migration area litigation can be an end in itself. There is a high incentive for applicants refused permanent residence to delay removal from Australia for as long as possible. Some may seek to gain time to establish ties within the Australian community which they may hope will yield entitlement to a visa through another pathway. The incentive to delay removal from Australia is increased if the refused applicants are enjoying privileges such as work rights and access to Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advice I received about best achieving the government's policy objective of restricting access to judicial review was that the only workable option was a privative clause. That 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> advice was obtained from the Attorney-General's Department and eminent lawyers in the private sphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members are aware, section 75 of the Commonwealth constitution gives the High Court original jurisdiction to consider challenges to the actions and decisions of Commonwealth officers. As a result, access to the High Court cannot be legislatively restricted without a constitutional amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While access to the Federal Court, and the scope of judicial review it can exercise, can be changed by legislation, to simply restrict access to the Federal Court in migration legislation matters would in practice deflect many cases to the High Court. That would have the potential to erode the proper role and purpose of the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legal advice I received was that a privative clause would have the effect of narrowing the scope of judicial review by the High Court, and of course the Federal Court. That advice was largely based on the High Court's own interpretation of such clauses in cases such as Hickman's case, as long ago as 1945, and more recently the Richard Walter case in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members may be aware that the effect of a privative clause such as that used in Hickman's case is to expand the legal validity of the acts done and the decisions made by decision makers. The result is to give decision makers wider lawful operation for their decisions and this means that the grounds on which those decisions can be challenged in the Federal and High Courts are narrower than currently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In practice, the decision is lawful provided the decision maker: was acting in good faith; had been given the authority to make the decision concerned&mdash;for example, had the authority delegated to him or her by me, or had been properly appointed as a tribunal member&mdash;and did not exceed constitutional limits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The options available to the government were very much shaped by the constitution. While I accept that the precise limits of privative clauses may need examination by the High Court, there is no other practical 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7616"> option open to the government to achieve its policy objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the measures in this bill will limit judicial review, it does not affect the existing access to independent merits review by the Immigration Review Tribunal, its successor the Migration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bill to the House and I also table the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first time that I stand on my feet in this House as the opposition shadow minister responsible for population and immigration. In accepting the respon 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sibility for the opposition, I understand that it is not only a heavy workload but also a very heavy responsibility. I say that because I believe that Australia has an enviable reputation for successfully integrating into our society the peoples of many different nations, cultures and religions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this issue we are a model for other nations, as so aptly noted in November when President Clinton visited Australia and praised our nation as a multicultural success story. President Clinton noted that Australia had a higher percentage of immigrants who had come here and built decent lives through hard work than almost any other country in the world. Mr Clinton marvelled at our success and said, `I cannot think of a better place in the entire world, a more shining example of how people can come together as one nation and one community.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a wonderful reputation&mdash;a reputation that we should carefully maintain and nurture as we move into the next century. It also means that this parliament has huge responsibilities to maintain that reputation, and it requires from time to time that all members of this House take hard decisions to ensure that we protect that reputation and stand up to those minorities who would seek to undermine and erode that reputation both within Australia and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In good part, the different communities which have come to our country have trust in this reputation because we have created a system of review of decision making which they can accept as open, fair and impartial. They know that, if they are worried that large faceless bureaucracies have made wrong and unfair decisions, they have recourse to a fair appeal mechanism. We as a Labor opposition consider a fair appeal mechanism to be exceptionally important. On that note, can I suggest that Australia has led the world in the creation of administrative review systems, of administrative appeal mechanisms. The systems we set in place are now being closely studied by a wide range of nations as a model which they want to copy for their local legal processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always believed that a properly run, transparent process of administrative review 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7622"> of both immigration and refugee matters is one that we should go out of our way to maintain. Obviously from time to time it requires governments, irrespective of who is in power, to ensure that action is taken to maintain such a system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also keenly aware of its value, not only from the point of view of the nation at large but also, importantly, from the point of view of my own electorate of Batman in the northern suburbs of Melbourne&mdash;an electorate that is very much made of people who have come to Australia from many different countries. They often raise the importance of such a system as a safeguard, a sense of opportunity, to ensure that they are given a fair go in the traditional Australian way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am therefore keenly aware of its value for Australia if we are to maintain a decent society. It is not a revelation to note in this place that in recent times trust in the immigration and refugee processes has broken down. That is a fair statement acknowledged by both sides of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that some people in this House have unfairly and unwisely exploited this issue for their own crass political gain. For that, a minority are to be condemned. It is about time they faced up to their responsibilities so that, when they raise these issues, they raise them in a proper and objective way so that we maintain the integrity of our system and provide opportunities for people to ensure that they avail themselves of all available legal rights, not for crass political gain which undermines the integrity of that system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments of all political shades must seek to build and maintain community support for an intelligent population policy. I believe that is the objective of both sides of the House, though it is fair to say that from time to time we have debates and differences with respect to the content of that population policy. Governments of all political shades must seek to build and maintain the fair go and decency which Australians have generally displayed towards each new wave of immigrants to our nation. On that note, can I suggest that a transparent administrative review process for migrants and refugees, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which has the trust and support of all Australians, is a key ingredient in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For one moment I would like to digress. I want to note here that another key ingredient at this time is an effective quality education campaign on the issue of racism. This government, despite election rhetoric, has not yet produced the anti-racism campaign it has promised the community. I think it is exceptionally important that the government now proceed to implement that promise. It should treat that as a core election promise because I would like to know, and the Australian community would like to know, when the department's market testing of this campaign will be completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When will we finally see this important campaign, or is it conveniently being caught up in the bureaucratic mire because of the weak leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on this issue? It is not Mr Howard who is leading this issue but another politician in this House, whose surname also begins with `H', who is leading on this issue at the moment for crass political gain. I think it is important that others in the House join together to ensure that a decent and objective anti-racism campaign be put in place as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of this bill before the House, I would like to say that, had we been re-elected, a new Labor government would probably have taken the opportunity to review, to look at the current processes. For that, we do not question the current government. It is clearly the right thing to do. I am sure that the new Labor minister in this portfolio would have wanted to carefully evaluate and judge whether the processes could be improved, made more efficient and fairer in the interests of Australia, in the interests of all the communities which make up our great nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before us this morning seeks to make amendments to the administrative processes available to migrants and refugees who come to our shores. My predecessor in this portfolio area&mdash;the member for Denison, Mr Kerr&mdash;has had most of the carriage for negotiations with the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7623"> this issue. My colleague has advised me that he has successfully negotiated with the minister's office on these matters to ensure that today we are discussing the least contentious areas, and the more contentious matters of debate have been introduced as a separate bill and will be debated at a later time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key issues of the bill relate, firstly, to the merging of the Migration Internal Review Office and the Immigration Review Tribunal into a new body called the Migration Review Tribunal; and, secondly, to giving the principal members of the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal clear authority to give directions on the operation of the tribunals with the objective of obtaining efficient processing practices. I wish to make it clear that, whilst the opposition regrets the decision to eliminate a process of internal review, we accept the government's intention of merging the Migration Internal Review Office and the Immigration Review Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, we accept the desire of the government to ensure efficiency in the running of the proposed Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal but think it dangerous to allow the principal member alone the extensive powers proposed in the bill. We are therefore particularly concerned about the proposal to allow the principal member to direct that a member constituting the tribunal for a particular matter be removed. Any undue delay&mdash;such as a serious illness on the part of a member constituting the tribunal&mdash;should constitute grounds for removal. Obviously we will consider the suggested amendments by the government with respect to those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should consider a number of safeguards on this issue so as to maintain the transparency and the integrity of the tribunals. As an example, any such directions by the principal member should specify the reason for removal, be signed by the principal member and the member removed and a member directed to now constitute the tribunal. We also believe there should be strict guidelines and safeguards to ensure that the power to hear matters without the personal attendance of an applicant are not abused.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to take a few moments to comment on what will now become Migration Legislation Bill (No. 5) 1997&mdash;the more contentious amendments to the administrative review processes which came into this place earlier today for debate and have been adjourned for future debate. I suggest that the good, cooperative relationship developed by my predecessor, the member for Denison, with the minister's office has seen the debate on this contentious bill adjourned for another date to allow the less controversial matters which I have spoken about today in the  Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997  to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We oppose the wholesale elimination of judicial review as wrong in principle and the thin edge of the wedge for other administrative review matters&mdash;that, to the Labor opposition, is exceptionally important. Earlier I noted the need to maintain the integrity and transparency of the administrative review process. This should be accepted by all parties as a basic principle. We have very real concerns that the government's current proposals for elimination of judicial review will undermine this principle. We will argue strongly that the High Court will almost certainly invalidate the intended effect of the privative clause in the human rights context of immigration and refugee decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government is therefore embarking on a very expensive and futile legislative process with the next migration bill to come before this House for debate. I note here that the Administrative Review Council currently has a project before it looking at appeals from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to the Federal Court. The results of this reference may have important implications for the government, given the plans by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to amalgamate review tribunals into a single body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The opposition will insist that the bill dealing with the removal of judicial review be referred to a Senate committee for thorough public consultation. I would have thought that that ought to be agreed to by the government, because we are talking about a major change with respect to this proposal.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7624">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I seek to conclude on this note. The opposition is concerned to maintain the integrity of the migration and review process for the reason I indicated, that is, we would have reviewed the issues currently before the House for debate. We do not question the government's intent, which is to maintain the integrity of the processes and to ensure that all get a fair go with respect to those issues. The Australian community has a right to demand from its political leaders that they should be secure that this process will deliver a fair, just system which takes into account the primary interests of all the peoples who now live in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R253">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997</XREF>  will implement a series of important reforms to refugee and immigration decision making. These measures flow from election commitments. The key provisions of the bill amount to a limitation of the role of the courts in immigration and refugee matters through the use of a privative clause. I will discuss that matter in some further detail in the latter part of my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two main components to Australia's immigration program: the migration (non&hyphen;humanitarian) program and the humanitarian program. The former caters for the majority of immigrants and consists of the skilled stream, preferential family, concessional family and special eligibility programs. The humanitarian program comprises the refugee, special humanitarian and special assistance categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In 1995-96, the rate of immigration was significantly higher than in previous years&mdash;but, in particular, it was higher by 13.4 per cent in 1994&hyphen;95. Digressing a little, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), did, perhaps in a way that contributed to the so-called perceived concern and gave rise to what was a really silly statement made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) that we were being overrun by Asians. I say it is silly because when I was growing up in the 1950s and 1960s I can remember people coming here from Italy and Greece and there were real concerns at the time that we were being 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> overrun by Greeks and Italians. What a load of rubbish that turned out to be. A great enrichment of our culture occurred as a result of those people coming to this country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SK6">Mr TONY SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And I am reminded about the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou). It is important to put that into context because, when we look at this silly statement that was made, we forget about the fantastic things that have been achieved and we forget about the migrants who have contributed to the great projects of Australia&mdash;for example, the Snowy Mountains scheme and great railway projects&mdash;and about the hard work and the hard labour that they have undertaken in pursuit not only of uplifting themselves but also of enriching the country. I have likened their contribution to Australia as being spliced onto the trunk of a tree that is now much more healthy for their coming here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not, however, go so far as the honourable member for Batman in relation to racism education. We have to be very careful not to give credence to a lot of the things that are being said in the debate because an overreaction raises the issue to a much greater temperature than it really demands. We have to get on with it. We have to ignore the ignorant comments. We have to be very careful not to overreact, because we do not need to give credibility to some of the things that have been said in this area and inflame public passions to an undue degree. It is just unnecessary and irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have become acquainted with a Polish family in recent years and with the hard work of a particular elderly Polish migrant who came here. He used to travel from Newcastle to Brisbane to work. He would come home to see his family on weekends. He worked very hard in the Evans Deakin shipyards as an ironworker. It has been an absolute privilege to be associated with this man. It highlights yet again the enormous privations that people from those other countries have suffered. They have come here, have not wanted pity, have got on with it, have worked hard and have done very well in this country, and long may that continue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7625">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, when considering the numbers of people who are coming here, we must also balance the interests of those people who are here and we must ensure that we get the balance right. Of the almost 100,000 people who came to Australia in 1995-96, 13,824 arrived under the humanitarian program. They were mainly from the former Yugoslavia and the Middle East.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The refugee category of the humanitarian program is only available to people who satisfy the United Nations' definition of `refugee'. In summary, that means a person who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group, and is unable or unwilling to return to his country because of such well-founded fear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The special humanitarian category is open to those who have suffered discrimination or other violations of their human rights but who are not refugees. The special assistance category is available to people who are in vulnerable positions overseas and who have close links with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many Australian people have been concerned about the incursion of boat people over the years. But I tend to feel, with respect to those who believe otherwise, that it has been exaggerated a good deal. For example, between 1989 and 1996, 2,508 boat people arrived in Australia without authorisation and, of those, nearly 1,800 people have been removed and sent back. During 1995-96, 589 boat people arrived in 14 boats and, of those, 413 have been removed, with an average time before removal of 17 days. So in my submission that does put the argument into some context and into some reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the thrust of the bill is to create a Migration Review Tribunal for non-refugee decisions replacing the existing two-tier process, which involves an initial departmental review&mdash;the Migration Internal Review Office, MIRO&mdash;followed by a review by the Immigration Review Tribunal, the IRT. The bill also inserts a privative clause in the Migration Act to limit the role of the courts in immigration and refugee matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has taken steps as part of this process to address what has been&mdash;and, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I think, justifiably&mdash;treated as an abuse of migration based on fabricated or non-bona fide relationships, especially in relation to spouse and fiancee applicants. These measures include the extension of the two-year probationary period for onshore spouse applications to offshore spouse applicants, limiting serial sponsorships, more rigorous assessment procedures, and requiring a one-year cohabitation period for de facto and interdependency relationships. Other measures introduced to restore the balance to the program include the ability to cap the number of aged parents able to enter Australia in any one year and an increased emphasis placed on the English language for concessional family members wishing to enter Australia from 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does provide a number of measures to allow for more flexible processes in both the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. They will amount effectively to a streamlining and in particular they provide a discretion for tribunals to decide whether or not a personal hearing will be of assistance to the decision making process, enable the tribunals to use the telephone or other media to conduct personal hearings or to require other witnesses to appear before them, and allow tribunals to proceed to a decision without delay if an applicant does not respond to a notice to attend a hearing or provide comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The background to a lot of this is the enormous amount of litigation that has occupied the time of courts and, obviously, in many cases, the enormous amount of taxpayers' money that has been used in dealing with the litany of procedural steps and ultimately the court process. The bill effectively gives imprimatur to the government's pre&hyphen;election policy commitment that it would restrict access to judicial review in all but exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That commitment was given in light of the extensive merits review rights in the migration area and arose from concerns about the growing cost, incidence and delays in migration litigation. To give effect to that commitment, the bill introduces a new judicial review scheme to cover decisions under the Migration Act relating to the ability of non&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7626"> citizens to enter and remain in Australia. The key mechanism in that process being the privative clause provision at new section 474. This provision and related sections will replace the existing judicial review scheme. The new judicial review process, unlike the existing scheme, will apply to the High Court and not just the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of the existing scheme really has determined the need for a new judicial review scheme. It is interesting to reflect very quickly on what could happen if the process&mdash;which is generally regarded as an awful bog in the court and review process&mdash;kept going. The current process was introduced by the previous government in September 1994. It was part of a package that included: expanded access to merits review; a requirement that any review rights must be exhausted prior to seeking judicial review; statutory codes of procedure for visa decision making and some restriction on the rights of judicial review in light of the access to merits review; and statutory codes for visa decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government intended those changes to reduce Federal Court litigation and to provide greater certainty as to what was required from both decision makers and visa applicants and holders. However, the scheme did not reduce the volume of litigation before the courts. The number of cases has continually trended upwards. Recourse to the Federal Court and the High Court has trended upwards with 400 applications in 1994&hyphen;95, 600 in 1995-96 and over 700 in 1996&hyphen;97&mdash;perhaps they were trying to overcome the impending changes. It is anticipated that the number could rise to around 850 in the current financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995-96, migration legislation matters formed approximately 65 per cent of the Federal Court's entire administrative law caseload. This surely highlights the totally out of proportion trend. It must be borne in mind that at a time when legal aid funding for cases of great merit is being reduced and has not been made available&mdash;and that has been the trend for a number of years&mdash;we have to give priority and ensure that citizens of Australia have access to the courts. Priority must be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> given to those citizens in considering the carve up of the legal aid cake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The privative clause provision came into being after much consultation with very eminent senior counsel. Ultimately, advice was received that a privative clause was the only workable option. Under section 75 of the constitution, which relates to judicial power, the High Court has original jurisdiction to consider challenges to actions and decisions of Commonwealth officers so that access to the High Court cannot be legislatively restricted otherwise it would be unconstitutional. However, it is slightly different in the Federal Court where the scope of judicial review can be changed by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To simply restrict access to the Federal Court would in practice under section 75 deflect many cases to the High Court. This has the potential to erode the proper role and purpose of that court. Ultimately, advice was taken from counsel. Acting on that advice the government has accepted that a privative clause would have the effect of narrowing the scope of judicial review. This advice was taken largely on the High Court's interpretation of such clauses in the Hickman case of more than 50 years ago and, more recently, the Richard Walter case of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members may be aware that the effect of a privative clause, such as that used in Hickman's case, is to expand the legal validity of the acts done and the decisions made by decision makers. The result is to give decision makers wider lawful operation for their decisions and this means that the grounds on which those decisions can be challenged in the Federal Court and High Court are narrower than currently. In practice, the decision is lawful provided the decision maker is acting in good faith, had been given the authority to make the decision concerned and did not exceed constitutional limits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, these measures are important in streamlining the migration process and in ensuring that those applicants of substance are heard promptly, efficiently and at the minimum of cost. They also ensure that those who are postponing the evil day of deportation are not clogging the courts unreasonably and extracting very necessary funds from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7627"> other areas in legal aid. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

Before doing so, I want to welcome in the gallery students of the Meadow Heights Primary School in my electorate, and I hope they are enjoying their visit to parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before the House originally contained two sections. It has been split and another bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5), actually deals with the judicial review aspects that the former speaker, the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), spoke about. In fact, most of those judicial review issues have been put into that new bill. The reason is that the opposition has made it clear that we will oppose many of the changes proposed by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) in relation to judicial review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an important reason for that which has to do with the fact that in this bill we are going to condense two levels of review into one. What has existed until now has been a review process involving MIRO, which is the internal review by the department, plus the Immigration Review Tribunal. Persons were able if they were rejected&mdash;for whatever reason&mdash;to first go to MIRO and, in the event that MIRO rejected them, then go to the tribunal. These two categories are going to be condensed into one, which means that there is going to be only one process of review in relation to immigration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us assume that that is an acceptable practice. What is not acceptable is that after that point people have hardly any ability to take their case to the courts if they feel that they have been hard done by in that review tribunal's determinations. This is especially the case if you consider the fact that the minister intended that the principal member&mdash;that is, the head of the tribunal&mdash;was to have very extensive powers to intervene in the decision making of the individual members of the tribunal.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, the minister has seen the error in this, and in the schedule which he has released of revised amendments we now have the acceptance of an argument put to him by the opposition. Now we have an amendment which limits the intervention by the principal member and specifies the way in which the principal member will be able to intervene in the determinations of other members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing here is that if we are going to have a condensed process whereby the two former review processes become one then the right of access to the courts is needed. Let me tell you that the minister is going to get himself into a lot of trouble with this&mdash;</PARA>

The courts themselves might throw out that bill as unconstitutional. Certainly it is very limited in its approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we already are tightening up in every direction on immigration. There has never been such a tightening of immigration rules and immigration processes as there is at the moment under this government. While the tightening may have been justified in some aspects, there is also the big danger of serious injustice against people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you an example. One of the consequences of the tightening up of the marriage situation has been that Australian citizens, not permanent residents, who are legitimately married overseas to a non&hyphen;citizen are being effectively placed in a queue, sometimes for six to nine months, waiting to be reunited with their wife or husband. We are not talking about illegal people. We are not talking about people who are doing anything wrong. We are talking about the fundamental human right to be together with one's partner or spouse. There is a very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7628"> serious problem here. The point is that there are many serious problems when you tighten up immigration rules in this way, and the big danger is that you will create unfairness in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This comes at a time when immigration and migrants have been under attack in a way that we have not seen in this country for more than 20 years. The shadow minister, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), mentioned this in his comments when he referred to the Hanson phenomenon and to the way in which in this country we have had the creation of a hostility towards migrants and towards the whole of the migration program. We have to be very careful that this kind of hostility does not continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know of the enormous damage which the Hanson phenomenon has done to this country and its international reputation, not the least aspect of which has been the role of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this matter, which has been commented on by many people: his failure to condemn the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) when she made those comments. He continues to make doubled&hyphen;edged statements and determinations&mdash;determinations which can be interpreted as being a not totally unambiguous condemnation of the views of the member for Oxley.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the beginning of my remarks I made some important comments about the review process. I will make further comments in relation to the review process, but I also want to remind the House that the context in which we are working is such that the review process will be in danger, in the current climate, of not properly serving the people when there is pressure from the government&mdash;especially on the principal member as well as on other members of the tribunal&mdash;that they be extremely tough with migrants as a result of the anti&hyphen;migrant view which has been adopted by this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one thing to say that we should have rules that govern the size of the program to ensure that we stick to the size of the program which has been determined&mdash;the size of the program is another debate&mdash;but it is another thing, within the context of those rules, to have unfairness, especially towards, for example, spouses and other persons coming here on the basis of family reunion who are in fact finding it increasingly more and more difficult to get into this country. It is very important under those circumstances, if their case is just, for the review process to be just to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government thinks that it will save time and money by merging the two levels of review, MIRO and the IRT. However, this is not necessarily the case because there were many people, having been rejected by MIRO in the second stage, who felt that the costs 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7630"> and the trouble involved in going through the third stage of the IRT were not worth it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lots of speedy determinations were made by MIRO through the old process. Having said that, we are not saying to the government that we will not accept the merging of the two processes. We have said&mdash;and the shadow minister said&mdash;that we will accept the merging of the two processes to see how it goes, to see whether it leads to a more efficient system and to see whether in fact it leads to a fairer system, which is something that we are concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the shadow minister has indicated and as the previous shadow minister, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), has indicated, we will not accept the idea of virtually totally getting rid of judicial review, which the government is intending to do by dividing this bill from the next bill, Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we will not be accepting that is, as I mentioned earlier, if you have only one process of review and something goes wrong in that review, then surely it should be possible to appeal to natural justice by going to the courts. If somebody has a reason why they feel the tribunal has made a determination which is contrary to natural justice or which is contrary to their fundamental rights or where they have not had a proper hearing, all of these different reasons ought to be taken account of when looking at the possibility of going to a review process. Therefore, it is very important that we allow the judicial review to continue&mdash;especially in a system where we have condensed the two levels, the MIRO level and the IRT level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering this question of review and the role of the principal member, I mentioned earlier that the minister has now amended his original intention so that the principal member will not have absolute power in the way the review was initiated in the first place. But, when reading the amendment, it is not entirely clear to me what will be the actual circumstances under which the principal member will be able to intervene to override a member and what will be the circumstances in which he or she shall not.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that situation, perhaps when the minister sums up this debate&mdash;since he brought this amendment in rather late&mdash;he might care to elaborate and explain to the parliament the kinds of circumstances in which he envisages that there will be interference by the principal member in relation to this process.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to contribute to the debate on <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R253">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997</XREF> . It was interesting to listen to some of the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). We have seen from the so&hyphen;called debate on racism that immigration is high on the list of issues which the people of Australia want to see changed. Let me say that I firmly believe Australians are not racists. Australians have welcomed citizens from other nations since before the Second World War when we established our first dedicated immigration program. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill that I address today is about putting our immigration program back on track. It is to assure the people of Australia that we take immigration seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason fear has been spread through our society is that the previous government did not take immigration seriously enough. The Keating government stopped asking people why they wanted to make Australia their home. The Keating government did not consider the long&hyphen;term ramifications of a community of people who could not speak English and were without job skills. The previous government did not worry about how the community would cope with an influx of people who were not even sure what to expect when they arrived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, some voices in the community have been able to incite fear and loathing. This will change, and I believe it has already changed. This government and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) have established firm parameters for the citizens from other nations who wish to make Australia their home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has already established firm rules which have confirmed to Australians that their taxes will no longer be spent 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7631"> on supporting people who came to this land in the belief the welfare system could support them indefinitely. Any person applying to migrate to Australia is now advised firmly and clearly that this is not a land of unlimited welfare and they cannot expect a free ride. As a result, we are already seeing a change in our migration pattern. We are seeing those who can and want to work and contribute to this country applying and receiving entry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill now addresses another area which had been left open to serious abuse, and that is the generosity of our legal system for protracted litigation. There is no doubt that many of the people who have applied for refugee status, have been rejected and have gone to court have had a legitimate case. Our democratic system allows such challenges and must be protected at all costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But just as the former government allowed unbalanced and inconsiderate immigration, so it allowed for an endless and costly system for those who challenged the tribunal's decisions. We have had people from Canada, the United States, the Philippines and Great Britain apply for refugee status. We have had people on visitors visas who, once their visa expired, applied for refugee status. These quite obvious fraudulent claims have been purposely taken through the court process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in the interest of every applicant to delay the process in investigating their claim to refugee status. And why? Because the applicant is buying time to bed down into the community. People who have been rejected by the refugee tribunal use the challenge time to establish some form of permanency. Getting a Medicare card is a good example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The applicant has used our legal system of appeal to buy time. The more they can stretch it out, the better their chance of overriding the tribunal's ruling. It is not uncommon for people challenging the refugee tribunal's decision to withdraw their application on the steps of the court room.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, this system which is so open to abuse and so costly to the taxpayer as a result is now subject to amendment as laid down in this legislation. The legislation is simple and in no way restricts access to the courts in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> migration matters. What it does do is clear the way for matters which are genuine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the creation of a new, streamlined Migration Review Tribunal obviously spurious claims will be finalised at the tribunal level. Those who have set about abusing the system with patently transparent claims will no longer find a clear path through the various levels of legal challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Crooked agents who prey on naive people and sell them Australian visas are one example. One such scam has been the marketing schemes offering people refugee status in Australia. Naive, mostly non-English speaking people have been paying a fortune for what ended up being a $30 temporary work visa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What must be stressed is that this bill does not alter the rights of anyone for a fair and impartial review. But by merging the current Migration Internal Review Office with the Immigration Review Tribunal we are creating a far more efficient, single&hyphen;tier system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also gives the principal members of both the Refugee Review Tribunal and the new Migration Review Tribunal clear authority to apply efficient processing practices. This in itself will prevent many hearings from being unnecessarily delayed. Being fair and equitable is not about being tough; it is about being efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that our review system has become bogged down by the knowledge that more than every second case would be subject of a legal challenge. The current system of non-refugee applications is also a two-tier system. This major change is to streamline that process into a single review by an independent review agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current internal review process which is carried out by the Migration Internal Review Office and then the external review carried out by the Immigration Review Tribunal has more than 7000 cases a year to hear. Under the existing system, we could expect to get through just 2,000 of those claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the internal and external migration review tribunals combined to form one single body of review, the system will be speeded up. This alone is not enough, but this bill also gives the heads of the two tribunals clearer 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7632"> powers of authority. The tribunal's principal member will have the power to apply more efficient processing practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the new Migration Review Tribunal will be independent decision makers able to reach their own conclusions on a decision under review in accordance with the law. Cutting down on the increasing litigation, most of it knowingly unwinnable, will free up the process for the legitimate claims. It will also help relieve the burden on taxpayers of costly legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is part of a wider program to balance our immigration program. Establishing a fair and sensible immigration program, one that is of value to all Australians, including our new arrivals, has meant change to all aspects of our program. I believe this migration legislation bill to create a single tier external review body is part and parcel of a necessary restructure of this new look for Australia. For those reasons I am pleased to support this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too support the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R253">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997</XREF> . It is a start. It is an effort by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock)&mdash;a minister who has I think, despite all his own inclinations, tried to address the mess that immigration was left in by the previous government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Labor Party appointed the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) as their spokesman on immigration, I breathed a sigh of relief. I thought we might get some improvement in the Labor Party's thinking in this area. That may be true, but so far there is no indication of it. The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) spoke on this bill. I certainly thank him for rereading the minister's second reading speech. It did bring a few things back to mind, and for that I am grateful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) comes into this House and predictably runs the line of denigration of Australia, how we are a racist society. I find this particularly galling. In my travels around the world&mdash;I have travelled quite extensively; I have been to China on many occasions&mdash;there is no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other country that is imbued with `a fair go', as Australia is. We are probably the least racist of all societies. Racism exists in various forms in Australia. A lot of it falls into the category of chiacking. As a migrant I myself was subjected to this. It did not take me long to realise there was no malice in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think what this bill does is sensible, but it does not go far enough. We seem to be hooked up on, `We can't cut down on appeals to the High Court.' Appeals to the High Court would appear to me to being made under sections 75(iii) and (v) of the constitution. Quite frankly, I do not think section 75(v)&mdash;where people seek writs of mandamus&mdash;will have a lot of application. I see no need to do anything about that. But section 75(iii)&mdash;`In all matters in which the Commonwealth, or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth, is a party: the High Court shall have original jurisdiction'&mdash;does need some thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the early fifties Barwick CJ successfully argued in the Privy Council that there was no right of appeal for Australian citizens where an issue was between states and the Commonwealth. So we are quite prepared to limit the options of our citizens but seem to be prepared to offer unfettered access to our system to non&hyphen;citizens. We see now a situation where litigation is about to ensue in our High Court, having been initiated by Indonesian fishermen caught fishing illegally in Australian zones, using the Wik ruling as the basis for their claim. I have absolutely no doubt they will be provided for by Australian lawyers, probably acting pro bono. In any case, it is a cost to the taxpayers. It ties up our court system with something which clearly has to be without merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In praising the minister for bringing in this legislation I would not like to go too far. No matter what the minister does with this legislation, the minister knows&mdash;and I know the minister knows&mdash;that illegal immigration in this country is out of hand. He knows that Fukien crime gangs are involved in impacting large numbers of illegal immigrants on to our eastern seaboard. When illegal immigrants enter Australia through my electorate they are either captured or they die. It does not pose 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7633"> a problem: they either perish or they are captured. But on the eastern seaboard it is impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Japan has just written a diplomatic letter to the Chinese asking them to stop the flow of illegal immigrants as they consider it a form of economic warfare. Of course that is exactly what it is. When the Japanese say that they know they are capturing less than one in three, with their vastly smaller coastline and their vastly superior navy, if they can only get less than one in three, how many do you think we are getting? It is probably less than one in a hundred. The minister knows it is a problem, but the government prefers to sweep it under the carpet rather than actually face up to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another problem. The member for Calwell talked about human rights. I do not think this is an issue about human rights. I can remember when the member for Calwell and I were on the Labor Party immigration committee. He said to me on one occasion, `Look, our views aren't all that dissimilar. I am in favour of a quota system.' I have never been in favour of a quota system. I think people should come here on merit, the justification being net value to Australia. It became clear to me that the member for Calwell was in favour of a quota system, providing he had a big say on who got in on his particular quota. It was a blatant grab for power, for patronage&mdash;something I think the member for Calwell understands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about fairness in the system. I see a slant very much against Europe right now. I have a situation before me in the independent immigrant category&mdash;a fitter from Germany with very good qualifications. Australia desperately needs fitters. We have not got fitters because under the Keating government we stopped training these people when Keating told us the future lay in the service sector&mdash;tourism. This guy has to pass a pretty stiff test, including a test on his English. The test is broken up into four categories: spoken, written, reading and interaction. He has to get a pass mark of five in every category to be accepted. This fellow got five points in written and five in reading, only four in spoken, but six in interaction. So 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he could clearly communicate&mdash;yet he got knocked back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also clear that in the UK there has been blatant rudeness at the front counter in order to deter people. I do not believe this happens without the imprimatur of the government. I think it is encouraged by the government. They say, `You be as rude as you can up front and discourage these people.' Of course, when you are rude in those situations, the average pom says, `Up you, I don't want to go anyway.' We then say, `We're not getting the number of applications that we used to get.' This has recently spread to Europe. I have had quite a few complaints from people in Germany about this same phenomenon of blatant rudeness at the front counter when they apply. That has to be addressed. It is most inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has to be understood that there is only one reason for immigration&mdash;that is, net value to Australia. We have no obligation to the world whatsoever. It is nonsense to suggest that Australia has some special humanitarian reasons for taking in large numbers of immigrants. If we were to take 100 million people from China or India, they would not even notice it, but it would give us a living standard somewhat akin to that of Bangladesh. No government has the right to impose that on future generations in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also highly amused when people get up in this House, as the member for Dickson and the member for Calwell did, and talk about the migrants who have come to this country. If they went out and talked to those migrants today, they would find that there was enormous support amongst those people for the curtailing of immigration. They understand the problem. They have seen it in their own countries. There is no support amongst migrants for mass immigration. What we do, of course, is speak to their self&hyphen;appointed leaders&mdash;members like the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a problem if you believe that you can talk to `ethnic leaders' and they will influence the votes of their fellows. That was the exact basis on which Malcolm Fraser endorsed the concept of multiculturalism. He thought he could get a few ethnic leaders to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7634"> influence other people. If you believe this, then you believe that ethnics are somehow more stupid than average Australians, and I do not believe that. Clearly, it is not the case. That has to be the basis if anyone believes that you can manipulate these people by getting to a few so&hyphen;called leaders. That has to be clearly understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calwell, in concert with a lot of other people in this House, has taken to attacking the member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson&mdash;shooting the messenger. Pauline Hanson is no doubt echoing the views of a lot of people. The test of free speech is when you are prepared to let people say things that you find disagreeable. That is a test of free speech and it is quite clear that the member for Calwell and many other people in this parliament fail this simple test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet free speech is a cornerstone of our culture. It is not a cornerstone of many other cultures, but it is of ours, and ours is the one that we must be concerned about. Free speech is something for which we have fought and died for a thousand years. If it does not endure, we as a nation will not endure, either. So it is important that it is defended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people openly invite Asian countries to denigrate us because we are racist. They know how susceptible Australians are to this charge. `Oh no, we're not racist; here, have another concession.' It is absolute nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to see racism alive and well, you should go to Asia. In Malaysia, it is just below the surface. I was talking to some Indian hire car operators there who said, `Goodness knows what will happen to us if the government changes, because below the surface it's simmering.' You would not want to be Chinese in Malaysia unless you are a very rich Chinese, because there is legislation against you. In China, the contempt with which they looked upon Indians and Malays was, I found, amusing. So it is nonsense to suggest that this country is particularly racist. It is simply not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people are not fools. If they can see an advantage in trade, they will press that button. We have ministers and the member for Calwell traipsing around pressing that button for them. It is an absolute nonsense. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The disgraceful attack on Blainey by the member for Calwell demonstrated both his ignorance and his lack of regard for freedom of speech. There is not an educated Chinese in this country who does not know they are much safer here than they would ever be in Indonesia. I do not think anyone would seriously argue otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are on the subject of immigration, it is worthwhile comparing the policies of our neighbours on immigration. Malaysia has been taking a lot of immigrants in recent times. Its policy is to take compatible people. That means, of course, people from Indonesia, who speak the same language and basically have the same religion. The policy of Japan&mdash;until recently Japan, too, was a migrant intake country&mdash;was to take people of Japanese origin, mainly from Brazil but also a few from Hawaii. The policy of Singapore&mdash;and they make a virtue of compatibility&mdash;was to take them from north&hyphen;east China, which was even more selective. They did not want them from southern China; they were seeking people from north&hyphen;east China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is alright for them to be highly selective and have race based policies, I am not advocating that for Australia. What I am advocating is what is in the best interests of Australia. It is quite clear that the family concessional area is not in Australia's best interests. I believe this category should be scrapped entirely. It is simply nonsense to suggest there are human rights involved in this issue. I do not have the right to go and reside in France simply because my wife is French, nor should I; nor should my wife's family have the right to come here simply because she is here. It is a decision which people make. With the availability of travel, the world is a relatively small place. I do not believe it imposes an enormous burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred to the member for Oxley. Her maiden speech in this parliament was an honest, naive, from&hyphen;the&hyphen;heart speech. There should be many more of those speeches in this parliament. It was not a speech that deserved the denigration she got. What happened was that there was a bipartisan approach by Tweedledum and Tweedledumber, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7635"> who decided that they would combine to squash this woman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were joined by a self&hyphen;serving media in Australia, by every conceivable pressure group and by the churches, whose own record is fairly appalling. Those were the people who got together and thought, `We'll squash this woman to such an extent that no&hyphen;one will raise these issues again.' Do you see what is happening? They are allowing us to churn around the race issue, but they are intent that it does not spread beyond that. People will recall when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, said in this House, `Freedom of speech is all right, but you can't let freedom of speech interfere with trade.' Then he realised what a foolish thing he had said and sought to cover his tracks by expounding the virtues of free trade to Australia and said that he could not see how anyone could deny the virtues of free trade to Australia. I categorically deny that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Free trade and the level playing field are not being built for Australia; they arise out of the machinations of big business&mdash;mainly American big business&mdash;to control world trade. What they have given to Australia are high levels of unemployment, a high current account deficit and a high degree of deskilling of the people in this country. That is not in the interests of this nation, nor is it in the interests of the migrants who come here seeking a better life for themselves. They probably understand it better than the average Australian because they have been there, in many cases, they have seen it and they have done it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the minister has made a start in this bill. He must keep the pressure on. It is sensible to require levels of English competency, and by that I mean a general competency. I can remember it was the member for Calwell in the Labor Party who actually took that out of consideration and it took us some considerable time to get it back in. This is certainly not racist. There are many people in the world who speak English. Many migrants say, `We put a lot of effort into learning to speak English before we came and we believe we should be given more recognition.' I am inclined to agree with them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has obviously got some instructions from somewhere&mdash;probably from large donors to the Liberal Party&mdash;telling him he must attack Pauline Hanson, and he is doing that now against his own inclination. The other day he talked about having a totally non&hyphen;discriminatory policy in Australia on immigration. I say to the Prime Minister that if that means we are going to accept in this country people whose culture is so different as to be non-compatible with Western liberal democracy then we are doing this nation a disservice and it is a policy which is not in the interests of this nation. It is simply nonsense to argue otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, I cite fundamentalist Islam. You do not have to argue the merits or otherwise of it vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis their own culture; you simply have to recognise that it is not compatible with Western liberal democracy and you politely decline entry to these people. I do not see anything wrong with that problem because, as I say, the policy of immigration must be net benefit to Australia and, if it is not of net benefit, we should not do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have probably done as much as anyone in this House on genuine refugee work. I believe Australia has an enviable record with refugees and I want to maintain that record, but there has to be recognition that we are not getting genuine political refugees today; we are getting economic refugees. Australia cannot solve the world's economic problems, nor should it try. There is a lot of misapprehension out there which is being fed by the likes of the member for Calwell and the likes of our Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was in South Africa in January I was upbraided by some obviously wealthy Indians who said to me that it was disgraceful, with Australia's large land area, that we were not having masses of migrants. I asked them if they had been up to north&hyphen;west India in recent times. Of course, they had never been there. If they went there, they would find there are not a lot of people, just as there are not a lot of people in north&hyphen;west China. It is a very large, barren, inhospitable land. In China, two&hyphen;thirds of the population reside in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7636"> one-third of the country. There is a lot of land there which is lightly populated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason Australia is so lightly populated is that it really cannot stand much more population pressure. The inland is arid and dry. This is the driest, oldest and probably the most infertile continent in the world. I think the government should spend a lot of time promoting that rather than a lot of the glossy images that are promoted overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many leading academics who suggest that our population is already too high. I would also say that there are indications that our population is also considerably understated. That is realised when you look at commodity consumption patterns and you find that key items would not be consumed by the number stated in the census. You would need considerably more people, at the average rate of consumption, to utilise them. And, of course, illegal immigration is a big source.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was upbraided in this parliament when a Chinese friend of mind ridiculed the suggestion that Australia has 100,000 illegal immigrants. He said there were at least four times that amount. I believe the government knows that and it is simply not prepared to act. The minister's response to me is that I should put up or shut up. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an understatement to say that since the arrival of the First Fleet Australia has been fundamentally impacted on by immigration. Today, around 23 per cent of the Australian population was born overseas and the overwhelming majority of Australians are descendants of immigrants. Successive waves of migrants have made a significant and lasting contribution to Australian society and immigration will be an integral part of this nation's future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, like its predecessors throughout the second half of the 20th century, is committed to a positive immigration program which serves our national interests and meets our international obligations. This is a bipartisan commitment disliked by some in this House, but confirmed in this House on 30 October 1996 in a motion unanimously carried by those present that we will maintain 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an immigration policy `wholly non&hyphen;discriminatory on grounds of race, colour, creed or origin'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This commitment reflects the strong belief that people should be judged on individual worth and merit, on character, behaviour and achievement and not on ethnicity, religion or skin colour. Unfortunately, there are some who do not share this belief; and I state again that the views of such people need to be vigorously challenged and utterly rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike most countries, Australia has a formal immigration policy which covers a wide variety of entrants, ranging from tourists to refugees to family members to permanent settlers, to name just a few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of applications for entry into Australia is huge. In 1996&hyphen;97, there were over 3&half; million applications, of which only 157,000 were applications for permanent residence. To administer this policy, we have a substantial bureaucracy, a wide range of laws and regulations and a body of policy guidelines for the department. The bureaucracy is expected to apply all of these in making its decisions on visa applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a very considerable period of time in Australia's past, migration decisions were essentially bureaucratic decisions made without the constraints of formal appeal processes. Throughout the 1980s, however, avenues of appeal against immigration decisions through both the courts and administrative tribunals were progressively opened up. However, the evolving appeal system&mdash;and I think there is agreement on this&mdash;was not without its problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite several attempts at reform by the previous administration, on coming to government the coalition inherited a system which was deficient in a number of respects. The system showed signs of being inefficient and excessively bureaucratic, providing multiple layers of appeal which caused long delays in the processing of applications and imposed unnecessary costs upon the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also fair to say that it is seen as a system which opens up the immigration program to the possibility of abuse by some 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7637"> at the expense of legitimate migration applicants. It is important for the continued success of Australia's immigration program and for public confidence in the program that these problems be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important that we keep the issue in context. We get 3&half; million visa applications a year. In 1995&hyphen;96, only about 10,000 decisions were actually appealed. Taken as a proportion of total applications, and despite the fact that a number of these applications are non&hyphen;appealable, the actual appeal rate was less than 0.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to maintain a perspective on the dimensions of the abuse of the immigration program. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs estimates that the number of illegal immigrants in Australia runs at around 45,000 at the present time. Estimates for illegal immigrants in other countries, although not completely reliable, indicate the magnitude of the problem elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The USA has a gross of two million illegal entrants annually, and a stock of illegal immigrants numbering between three and five million. The ILO estimated that in 1991 Italy had 600,000 illegal immigrants, and current estimates are that Italy has about two million illegal immigrants. The estimate of the number of illegal workers&mdash;as opposed to illegal migrants&mdash;in Malaysia is 500,000 and in Thailand it is 590,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to recognise the magnitude of the issue and we need to address the deficiencies of Australia's immigration appeals process. The  Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997  seeks to do this by reducing duplication and improving procedural consistency in the reviews of immigration decisions, maximising the independent review tribunals' speed and efficiency and addressing the increased number of immigration appeals to the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill reduces duplication by streamlining the merits assessment procedure for non&hyphen;refugee applications. At present such applications are initially decided by the department, are internally reviewable by the Migration Internal Review Office, MIRO, and then externally reviewable by the independent Immigration Review Tribunal, the IRT. In 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some circumstances these decisions can also be appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and to the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new arrangements will merge MIRO with the IRT to form a single independent review body to be known as the Migration Review Tribunal. This change will streamline the review process and make the reviews of all immigration decisions consistent with the processes currently operating in the area of refugee applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone currently able to seek a review by MIRO or the IRT will be able to seek a review of that decision by the MRT. In  addition, as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) pointed out in his second reading speech, the bill also includes safeguards for applicants by introducing a code of procedure for both the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. This code includes the giving of a prescribed notice of the time for a hearing and a requirement that applicants be given access to and time to comment on adverse material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that creating the MRT of itself will almost inevitably increase the number of cases considered by the independent tribunals. The fact is that MIRO deals with about 5,000 appeals a year, and such appeals will now be taken directly to the MRT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also proposes changes designed to improve the speed and efficiency of the independent review tribunals. In its present form, the bill seeks to achieve this by providing that a tribunal can be reconstituted where the principal member thinks that this will assist the efficient conduct of the review; repealing the existing provision giving applicants the right to a personal appearance before either tribunal; and requiring that the tribunal should, so far as practicable, comply with the directions of the principal member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Speed and efficiency in the review process are vital, and the abovementioned mechanisms further them. However, the government regards it as fundamental that the possibility of unintended negative consequences be avoided, and I understand that it will be moving amendments to achieve this.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7638">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing provisions in the bill regarding personal appearances raise the possibility that the tribunal may not always grant a personal appearance to an applicant, even where such an appearance could be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my understanding that no express right exists in the Australian common law, statute law or the constitution for a person to be present at court or tribunal proceedings which affect them. The rules of evidence, procedural fairness and the procedural rules of the courts do, however, provide a clear presumption that justice must not be administered behind closed doors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, there is a body of opinion which would hold that excluding a party to a matter being considered by an administrative law tribunal, as permitted by this bill in its unamended form, may result in the denial of natural justice because the person concerned may lose the opportunity to make submissions and answer adverse allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the parliament should be reluctant to legislate for such an outcome and that the expected government amendments guaranteeing the right of applicants to present their case in person before the tribunals, subject to some appropriate restrictions, will enhance the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the reconstitution of tribunals, at the direction of the principal member a reconstitution could take place at any stage prior to the recording of a formal decision. The fact is that this might be construed as giving the principal member the ability to compromise a fair hearing. Although it is highly unlikely that such a possibility would become a reality, we should be very cautious about creating such potential. Such a perception could undoubtedly be corrected by a requirement that the principal member consult with other members of the tribunal and that time limits be put in place, prior to which no reconstitution could take place. I understand that the amendments to be moved by the government do achieve this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Administrative review tribunals such as the MRT and the RRT occupy a finely balanced position in the Australian politico-legal system. They are given the decision making powers and responsibilities of the executive 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arm of government. Indeed, they are often organisationally located within the executive. At the same time, however, they are required to review the decisions of the executive, within the confines of legislation but with a degree of independence from the executive approaching that enjoyed by the courts. In these circumstances, I think it is fair to say that the relationship between the tribunals and the government of the day can become a little complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current Migration Act 1958, the IRT and the RRT are required to apply the Migration Act and the migration regulations to the specific cases which come before them. They are also required to follow government policy, as laid out in ministerial directions made under section 499 of the Migration Act and tabled in both houses of the parliament. They are not, however, required to follow the bureaucratic rules of thumb which guide much of the department's internal decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This distinction between binding and non-binding influence on the tribunal is very important. A good example of the distinction&mdash;and I think this is something that most of us come across in the course of our electorate duties&mdash;relates to an Australian citizen's sponsorship of a relative's application to migrate to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the migration regulations, for Australian citizens to be eligible as sponsors, they must be both `resident' in Australia and be `settled'; that is, `lawfully resident in Australia for a reasonable period'. The departmental guidelines state, `Under policy, two years is considered to be a reasonable period.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But is an Australian citizen considered to be reasonably settled if they have lived overseas for a period of time and returned to Australia and lived here for 18 months, bought a house, transferred their assets and property to Australia and established a business here again? In this case, as in others, the legislation gives decision makers a degree of discretion. It is essential that review tribunals are free to exercise such a discretion, having regard to the specific facts of the particular case which is before them.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tribunal is not, in the absence of specific statutory provision, entitled to abdicate its function of determining whether the decision made was, on the material before the Tribunal, the correct or preferable one, in favour of a function of merely determining whether the decision made conformed with whatever the relevant government policy might be.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I was concerned that the provisions in this bill relating to the directions made by principal members could be used for the purpose of giving policy directions. I have, however, been assured that my concerns are ill founded and that the provisions relate essentially to the administrative processes and practices of the tribunal. The fact is that policy directions are provided for under section 499 of the Migration Act, and they should be properly introduced where they are appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third significant aspect of the bill is its introduction of measures to deal with the increase in the number of immigration cases being taken to the Federal Court and the High Court. In the early 1980s, the Federal Court was receiving around 30 applications each year to review decisions made under the Migration Act. The former Labor government responded with the Migration Reform Bill 1992. The then minister for immigration, Mr Hand, said this in his second reading speech on the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are people who are intent on bypassing the established categories of entry into this country . . . Owing to weaknesses which have been inherent in our migration laws for many years, these people are often successful. Many manage to stay here, even though they do not fall within the specific visa categories, which is the only lawful way to enter and stay in Australia. At the very least, many manage to delay the substantive decision on their case and, as a consequence, their departure, by using the courts to exploit any weaknesses they can find in our immigration law. This must stop.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The 1992 act restricted the scope for judicial review of migration decisions to situations where the applicant had pursued all available merits review rights. Furthermore, the possible grounds for judicial review were considerably restricted. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where I found the comments by the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) highly amusing. The member for Calwell said&mdash;and I wrote down what he said&mdash;that the further limitation proposed by this bill and by Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) would terminate the ability of people to apply to courts in cases of a denial of natural justice and that this was appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well, in point of fact, in the Migration Reform Act 1992, the then Labor government excluded a number of grounds on which appeals could be made for review. The first one was an appeal based on a denial of natural justice. Other grounds which were excluded were unreasonableness, taking an irrelevant consideration into account, failure to take into account a relevant consideration and bad faith. So the crocodile tears cried by the member for Calwell are absolutely astonishing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a former Labor government which substantially restricted the grounds for appeal and that failed to achieve its purposes now saying the very things they excluded as grounds for appeal are things that we are now going to exclude. It would be highly amusing, if it were not so sad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's hope that these measures would reduce the number of migration cases coming before the courts has not been realised. In 1994-95, almost 400 applications were made to the courts in the area of migration law; in 1995-96, this rose to almost 600; and, in 1996-97, it was over 700. The fact is that the changes ushered in by Labor's 1992 reform act had no discernible impact on the trend of increasing recourse to judicial review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to note that, in November 1992, the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), speaking on behalf of the coalition in the second reading debate on the Migration Reform Bill, highlighted the likelihood of all this when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am disappointed that the government has gone to water in relation to this matter, because the system it seeks to put in place still provides access to a whole host of situations in which judicial review will be able to be obtained. That is a matter of concern to us. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7640">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Prior to the election, the coalition committed itself to correcting this problem. This bill achieves this by restricting the grounds for judicial review of immigration decisions to the question of whether or not the decision maker was acting within their jurisdiction and power in making their decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this provision will lead to a reduction in the number of immigration cases being appealed to the courts. The Labor Party should be cognisant of the fact, when arguing against this provision, that what they themselves did in 1992 in the pursuit of particular goals and objectives through actions which amounted to a substantial truncation of the rights to appeal did not meet those objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would like to make one other comment before concluding. I would like to thank the minister for his very careful consideration of matters relating to this bill. He put a lot of time and effort into getting them right. I commend the bill to the House and I look forward to the government's amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's immigration policy released prior to the last election contained a promise to review the efficiency of immigration decision making. The policy also stated that access to courts for the review of tribunal decisions should be restricted in all but the most exceptional circumstances. In the case of illegal immigration, the government has been not only too lenient but also all too willing to squander taxpayers' money and far too slow to deport illegal immigrants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no obligation by law to provide both an administrative review and a judicial review of applications, so why are you doing it? Why are illegal immigrants and criminals getting legal aid to delay their deportation when thousands of Australians are denied this taxpayer funded privilege?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Approximately 60 per cent of administrative cases before the Federal Court concern immigration matters. In the 1995-96 budget, litigation cost the immigration department $7.4 million. This figure did not include legal aid, court costs or the excessive costs of housing and feeding illegal immigrants during lengthy and unnecessary legal processes. This is expenditure you cannot reasonably justify 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and it is a bill the Australian people do not want. It is an affront to the Australian people that so much time and money is spent expelling from our shores people who, in most cases, are little more than opportunistic invaders taking advantage of our reputation as a soft touch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, hit the nail on the head when he said in March that too many people are using court action to delay departure. This is an urgent matter requiring not just words but action. The Australian people have had enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As at 25 March this year, there were over 600 cases of immigration related matters before the Federal Court, the Full Court and the High Court. Many of these matters will be withdrawn before the hearing, and only about 10 per cent of cases that go before the court are successful. I repeat: we cannot afford the luxury of providing illegal immigrants&mdash;those who sneak across our northern borders&mdash;with unlimited legal aid and assistance when our own people go without.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a recent case involving illegal immigrants arriving by boat, our government provided legal aid to these criminals to resist deportation through the Federal Court, the Full Bench of the Federal Court and the High Court&mdash;without success at any stage. What an unwarranted, inexcusable and disgraceful waste of the hard-earned money of decent Australians, who expect the government to be more responsible with their taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have seen people delay their departure while seeking work rights and access to Medicare. What sort of lunacy is this when our unemployment is so high and hospitals are stretched to the limit? Perhaps you will excuse your actions by claiming some relationship with humanitarianism. But this nonsense you pursue is nothing but an international invitation to take the Australian people for a ride.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As at February this year, over 300 people in our prisons came within deportation provisions. What are you waiting for? How long do we have to feed these foreign criminals for, when so many of our own people are hungry and 40,000 young Australians live on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7641"> the streets? The answer is to tighten up the system immediately, stop all the rorting, stop the waste of our hard-earned taxes and help restore public confidence in government decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be negotiating treaties with other countries to have these criminals deported so they can serve their sentences in their home country, instead of in the luxury of Australian prisons, where it costs $40,000 to $65,000 per prisoner per year. You and the governments before you have been extremely successful at signing deals that export Australian jobs. Let us see if you can get it together to export other countries' criminals to their place of origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government needs, firstly, to act immediately to stop foreign criminals from entering Australia in the first place and, secondly, to provide a quick and a cheap means of deporting foreign criminals should they manage to waltz through the gap in your security arrangements. These criminals should not get legal representation unless they pay for it. They should not be treated like well&hyphen;meaning tourists who have lost their way. They must be treated like the criminals they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is incumbent on you to ensure that anyone entering Australia is a decent, law&hyphen;abiding person who will in some way benefit those who are already here. If they are not in some way going to benefit Australia and Australians, then we do not want them. Australians are sick of being the world's soft touch. Australians are sick of imported problems&mdash;be they crime, disease or aspects of cultural difference that will never be able to accept the Australian way of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not for us to change, but for them to assimilate. We do not want Australia to become like the places so many people want to leave. So listen to the people and take heed. Fix these problems now or the people will take your positions and give them to those who truly represent Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On many occasions I have been called a racist. The fact is that I am a patriotic Australian who believes in Australia and the Australian people. I want to see our unemployment queues dwindle down to what they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should be and give Australians the jobs first, instead of allowing other people onto Australia's shores. It is just senseless and lunatic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People should have a knowledge of how to speak English. They must know how to assimilate. They must respect our laws, our flag and what Australia stands for. We must take heed of which people we are going to allow onto our shores. We do not allow in people who have diseases and we do not allow in people who have criminal records. We must have people who have something to offer Australia. We do not bring in people with health problems who are going to put such a strain on our hospital system when our own Australians cannot access our hospitals because they are overflowing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a country that so many people want to come and live in. Yet we seem to be bending over backwards to change our ways, our values and what we believe in to accommodate these people. The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) was right in what he said. Go and ask some of these other countries what their immigration policies are and what their beliefs are. No-one seems to point the finger at them and call them racist. We respect their views, their cultures and the way they want to run their countries. Yet, because I and many other Australians believe in the same rights for our own country, we are called racist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Patriotism is something that we are losing in this country. It is not being taught in our schools to our children.

That is why we must all be Australians together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) accused me and my views of affecting trade, yet he made a statement in this House last week saying that was trade up by over $100 billion.

People who do not and should not have a rightful place in this country should be sent back immediately, at no cost to the Australian taxpayer. If these people can afford to pay

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start by sharing my perspective on patriotism. I thought a patriot was someone who fought for their country, its people and its interests, not against them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) hit the nail on the head when he said in the second reading speech for the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 that the coalition faced a big problem when it came to government. In March 1996, we indicated the commencement of a program to restore credibility in Australia's migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, the program lost its way. The community had lost confidence in the integrity of the immigration program. Examples of unexplained massive growth in categories of the program, exploitation of the processes, incredible claims being made by applicants seeking to meet eligibility criteria and the out and out rorting of the program fed the public's perception of a lack of confidence and competence in Labor's handling of immigration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to touch briefly on the disquiet being generated within our community about immigration. The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) appeals to her people through empty sloganistic rhetoric that may ring true with some people, but that has little meaning and contribution to public debate. Her words can mean whatever the listener wants them to mean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the member for Oxley calls upon the balance to be restored, it is almost impossible to argue against such a motherhood statement because you know little about the sort of equilibrium she is talking about or how it might be achieved. This `Coke is it' advertis 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing language, which allows `it' to be whatever you want it to be, is no substitute for good, sound, solid public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley is not alone in this place in contributing to the community disquiet about immigration. Those who witnessed or heard the hysterical rantings of the likes of the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) earlier in the day would know they are equally divisive. Both can be accused of seeking to be controversial, selective and, at times, ignorant of the facts and of playing to their constituencies. This approach does nothing to promote and pursue Australia's national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, by moving an amendment during the consideration in detail stage of the debate on this bill, will seek to delete schedule 4, which deals with judicial review, and will reintroduce that as a separate bill. Therefore, the main focus of the bill before the House is the proposed creation of the Migration Review Tribunal to replace bodies like the Migration Internal Review Office and the Immigration Review Tribunal. I understand that the opposition is broadly supportive of these changes, although you would have found it hard to detect that listening to the member for Calwell. It is essential that procedural fairness continues, but it is also incumbent upon the appellate that the tribunals and the tribunal members be more effective and efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I examine in detail the bill's provisions I would like to state a few facts, as I see them. Firstly, most migrants to Australia have made a fantastic contribution to our shared set of values such as a belief that hard work has its own rewards, that the pen is mightier than the sword, that politics can be more useful than having a stoush out on the playing field and that Australian democracy relies on a continuation of tolerant attitudes between settler arrivals from different nations as well as a recognition that these settlers have rights and responsibilities to work with and contribute to the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that the coalition government has made the most substantive contribution in building confidence in the migration program and allowing the migrant community 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7643"> to feel confident and comfortable about its place and its contribution to this country. We have increased the importance of English language skills in the application process for some concessional categories to ensure that applicants that come to this country can function, can contribute, can participate in this nation and make a very worthwhile contribution to the development of opportunities for all Australians. We also have the two&hyphen;year onshore probationary period for onshore spouse applicants. That has been extended to people who make migration applications outside of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These sorts of constructive, tangible changes are addressing the sorts of problems the member for Oxley and others are talking about but not doing a lot about. The government is actually tackling these issues which are widely known and widely despised as issues that corrupt the integrity of the migration program. To the minister's credit and the government's credit something is actually being done about these things. The government now requires a one&hyphen;year cohabitation period for de facto relationships before they can qualify on that ground for migration. The minister has cancelled visas for criminals serving sentences or on parole in Australia and stopped them from being able to appeal against that decision. Action is happening. It is ignorant to suggest that the known deficiencies of the migration program are not being addressed by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New Zealand and the United Kingdom, each at around 12 per cent, remained the two largest sources of settler arrivals in the first half of 1996-97. While China was third, this shows that emigration from traditional sources remains very important. Changes in the migration program have not been taken lightly. I have already talked about some of the rock solid evidence the coalition government is giving to all Australians about how it is seeking to improve the program. These are driven by an acceptance by the vast majority of Australians that a sensible, well&hyphen;managed, well&hyphen;targeted migration system has benefits for this nation and its people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not responding to the noisy minorities like the lawyers picnic we saw 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under Labor for boat people detained at Port Hedland and Darwin. We are not going through knee&hyphen;jerk decisions like the then Prime Minister Hawke did to grant virtually instant residency to thousands of Chinese as a reaction to a disturbing international event. That decision led to a large wave of family migration, without much discussion by the Australian people as to whether this was good public policy and whether other events internationally warranted similar treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Dunkley community's largest source of migration is from the United Kingdom and Ireland, and it has been that way for some time. Detailed analysis of the 1996 census will soon be available. In 1991, almost 15,000 people or 13 per cent of the population were born in the UK&mdash;double the Australian average. New Zealanders comprise 1.5 per cent of the population. About 1,000 people or two per cent of the community are German and it is the same for the Dutch. Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece each have between 400 and 700 residents originating from these countries who now live in the Dunkley electorate. Lately, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, India have been new sources of migrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1991, a tiny 0.6 per cent of Dunkley's population or one in every 190 people were Asian born. This hardly amounts to a wave. The comparable figure for Australia is now 4.8 per cent and will probably rise to about 7.5 per cent in 30 years time. Again, that is a long way short of claims that Australia's population will soon be overrun by Asians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While maintaining a non&hyphen;discriminatory immigration program, the coalition government recognises that we have to facilitate more skilled migrants entering the country because these people are the ones who will make Australia more economically wealthy and hence provide more jobs for both our locally born and settler residents. We have some issues to confront about managing the migration program, but as evidenced by the government's decision to conduct an inquiry into the Mornington Peninsula area's settler migrant requirements, these difficulties are being addressed. The government is looking at what these self-help communities can do to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7644"> help these new settlers in the community I represent and that is to be commended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of this bill today is to emphasise that those who seek to rort or to queue jump the migration program will not be tolerated. You only need to talk to those settlers I spoke of in the Dunkley community to find out how riled they are by people who arrive here or come here on a tourist visa and then seek to stay. It is very annoying and frustrating for them, particularly those who have come through the more testing immigration criteria that have recently been introduced. These changes are about saying to those genuine migrants who respect and honour the migration system and the processes in this country, `There is a way for you to obtain very reasonable access to appeal rights, but do not come here thinking the processes can be rorted for you to stay longer or to stay indefinitely.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have talked about some of the issues confronting migrants in the electorate of Dunkley. One of them is that there is apparently an increasing number of people from non-English speaking backgrounds who are arriving at the Frankston Community Support and Information Centre looking for material aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In discussing these sorts of issues with the centre's coordinator, Vicki Martin, we looked at how important it was for sponsors to actually honour the undertakings they have given to the Australian community, and to the applicants, when they came to this country. It appears that some are not taking those sponsorship obligations as seriously as they should, and that is perhaps further evidence that under the former government the sponsorship obligations were very rarely enforced. So there are changes even coming through in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should not be, and it should never be, a part of the Australian ethos that new migrants can arrive and expect to immediately have full access to social security benefits, with the exception of refugees. What this is saying to the Australian community is that the choices migrants make about coming to this country have some consequences. One of the tests is that you have to make that contribution; you 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have to demonstrate your interest in being a part of this community. If you are coming here because of our very generous social security safety net, that is not necessarily in Australia's best national interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has increased to two years the waiting period for many visa categories under the immigration program for access to social security benefits. I do not apologise for this. When I speak with my community they understand that it does represent good public policy. Of course, without the hindrance of the opposition, taxpayers would have saved even more money, and that measure that we went to the election with, and gained support for, could have been more fully implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill requires the Migration Review Tribunal to conduct fair, impartial and expeditious reviews of migration decisions in a cost&hyphen;effective and efficient manner. Potential migrants will still have the same rights of appeal to the new MRT and the RRT as they enjoy presently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On occasions, unfortunately, I have had constituents coming into my electorate office who ask if I can make representations in support of applications from overseas relatives and the like. One of the great frustrations I have, Mr Deputy Speaker, as probably you do, is that many of them have not read the material that they have been provided with. When I examine the letters sent to them by the present appellate bodies like MIRO and the IRT, I find that the time allowed for an appeal has expired, the steps that were required to lodge an application have not been followed and, even more disturbingly, the grounds on which they seek to apply are very flimsy indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One example is a South African gentleman seeking just to visit our country as a tourist, not to stay here. In his application he had actually outlined the fact that he had thrown in his job, had sold his house, had no assets left, had cashed up, and that there was no reason for him to return. He inferred, during the interview, that if he liked the place he might want to stay. It is a bit difficult for me, as an elected representative, to then go back and persuade our representatives in South Africa that this guy is seriously just coming 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7645"> for a visit and will turn around and go back. The same problem existed with a gentleman in Mornington who, to his and my delight, fell in love. He fell in love with a lady who told our post overseas that the reason she should be given a visitor's visa to visit here was that she was engaged to be married to someone in her town and that she would definitely be going back. It is a bit hard then to argue that she has fallen in love with another man while she has been in Australia, and to argue against all the claims that were made when she secured the initial visitor's visa. These are some of the dilemmas that we, as local members, face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the most disturbing trend is the number of applicants who are seeking to appeal as a strategic option. They have gone to lawyers and migration advisers who have told them, `Throw in an appeal. Follow these steps. It will take so long that by the time it is all heard the government will be shamed into enabling you to stay.' This bill seeks to say, `No, that is not the way we are going to conduct our affairs. If you have made an application to migrate to this country on certain grounds and you have been rejected, there is a ready, affordable and quickly accessible way of having that decision reviewed, but do not view it as a tactical option. Do not view it as a strategy so that you can stay here for a longer period of time, queue jump, dishonour and show disrespect for the nation's migration system and, more particularly, displace migrants who have done the right thing.' I do not think that is unreasonable. The somewhat qualified support that the opposition has given to this bill&mdash;although I understand it is less qualified except for the member for Calwell&mdash;recognises this fact. It is to be commended on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs was discussing merits review in a speech to the National Administrative Law Forum in Canberra in May, he noted that it would be wrong to conclude from the government's desire to merge immigration review bodies that there had been any weakening in the government's commitment to review on merits. However, it was simply wrong that people could come here on tourist 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> visas and then use the onshore protection system to obtain work and secure benefits. Not only did this undermine the processing system but it amounted to queue jumping and a profound disrespect for our immigration system. Just ask earlier migrants, and those associated with people who have gone with the system, how fondly they view those who seek to jump the queue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To reduce abuse the government is seeking to minimise the chances of people being able to use lengthy delays in hearing cases as a de facto means of working here. Tribunals will now be able to use telephones or other means of communications to conduct personal hearings or to obtain statements from witnesses. The tribunals will, of course, have to consider in their decision making if the government has altered the balance between the components of the migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995&hyphen;1996, before this coalition government was elected, the planning level for migration was 83,000. The new coalition government lowered the planned 1996&hyphen;97 intake to 74,000 and turned many of the categories around in their emphasis to say that skills and capacity to contribute to this nation were of prime importance to the migration program. This was not only to reflect the community's concern about relatively high levels of immigration in certain categories but also to recognise that large groups of family migrants who came to Australia were, unfortunately, less able to obtain paid employment over time and were more likely to join the long&hyphen;term unemployed queues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will briefly talk about some of the other changes that the government has made. Of course, there is the employer nomination and business skill categories which will seek to address some of the skills shortages. There is the regional program where employers can say, `I live in a part of the country where I cannot gain access to the skills that I need.' That has also been a change the government has made. The business skills area is paying dividends for Australia. These migrants come to the country willing to start up businesses. Invariably they do, very successfully, employing 3.7 people after 12 months or 4.5 people after two years. Almost four in every five 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7646"> businesses export and each new business skills migrant brings an average of $1.15 million into Australia. This is creating jobs for the people of Dunkley. These are the sorts of changes the government has already made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud the changes the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is making and call on the opposition to be a little more helpful in seeing that they are implemented. While guaranteeing a continuation of fairness for applicants, this bill, together with the bills the minister has previously submitted, restores the integrity of the migration program, which for more than a decade has been politicised by those opposite, severely lowering the community's confidence in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A cohesive society cannot be brought about by inventing politically correct words or throwing slogans at one another. People in Dunkley have to know that they are involved in the decision making and the government is responsive to their concerns. The large number of expressions of concern the government has received about the size, composition and rorting of the migration program have been taken into account and the government has implemented responsible and thoughtful initiatives as a result of hearing these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end result of the coalition's changes will be a slightly lower level of immigration, a greater emphasis on skills, a greater test on the intending migrants' capacity to contribute to this country and, above all, procedural fairness that does not replace review processes with tactical options for rorting the system. I commend the bill to the House. I congratulate the minister, the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi), the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) and others for the contribution they have made to this bill and look forward to continuing informed debate about the nation's immigration program.</PARA></SPEECH>

The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) will have a great impact on that system of delivery and it needs to be highlighted and emphasised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without controlled, efficient and appropriate mechanisms to manage and implement Australia's immigration program, its overall effect will be costly. There need to be checks and balances in place in order to combat those forces seeking to undermine and exploit Australia's economic potential as a nation and to restore public confidence in the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has a very proud history of immigration policies that have contributed to the richness and diversity of Australia as a nation. In a world that is torn apart by wars and divisions, Australia can rightly take pride in its democratic, peaceful and diverse society. We have been a nation of immigrants and we have managed to grow steadily towards the 21st century as a dynamic, multicultural nation. That is one of the greatest strengths of this country. But all this is threatened by those who seek to abuse and manipulate the migration program in order to colonise or take advantage of this country's enormous potential and opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government must ensure, by the introduction of legislation and administrative measures aimed at regulating immigration controls, that it will be the one setting the migration agenda. Labor left us with this tremendous legacy of an immigration program that was out of control and unbalanced. It grew for three years in a row from 1993 to a figure totalling more than 82,560 persons and was still growing when the coalition assumed office. It was dominated by the family stream, which represented some 70 per cent of the program. It was inadequate in preventing abuse of the migration rules and allowed entry under the skill categories to persons with low skill levels and poor English ability. It served neither the national interest nor the interests of those new arrivals, whether they were genuine migrants or refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the debate over immigration has raged over the last year within the Aus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7647"> tralian community clearly demonstrates that the migration program did not have widespread support. There are many in the broad community who still believe that immigration is not in the public interest. More and more important, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that if we have a comprehensive, well&hyphen;controlled, long-term immigration policy in place the benefits to Australia in its economic and social future will be enormous, as they were in the past, particularly in a society with such a rapidly ageing population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some myths that do need to be highlighted. One of them is the area of the skilled migrant category. Recent longitudinal surveys have found that, within two years of arrival in Australia, a new business migrant invests in a business an average of $393,000 and employs on average some 5.1 other people and is involved in 60 per cent of the exports of this country. One of the most important steps towards setting the proper agenda for the government through this bill is that it aims to reduce the abuse of the current system and cut down on the cost to the taxpayer to manage and control these delays. This will allow people with bona fide applications to be given a decision more quickly and much more equitably than in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Streamlining the program will not only mean tailoring of the needs of the intake criteria but also help to meet Australia's economic, environmental and social needs. One of the biggest bottlenecks and areas for abuse and exploitation at the moment is the merits and judicial review system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last five years the cost and productivity of the present program demonstrate this perception of a program that has been allowed to get out of control and has been absolutely unbalanced. In the financial year of 1995&hyphen;96 the budget for the Immigration Review Tribunal was $7,446,000 while that of the Refugee Review Tribunal was $15,207,000. The two tribunals accounted for 5,666 cases over the same period. The cost of the internal review by the Migration Internal Review Office, MIRO, was $2,854,000. More alarming is that on current predictions, if this trend continues, by the year 1997-98 the estimate is that there will be approximately 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 910 applications made annually for Federal Court review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, so far in 1996-97, the litigation budget of the Immigration portfolio is in the order of $7.4 million, which does not take into account the cost of legal aid or the cost of running the courts. Protracted delays in finalising the migration and refugee decisions not only clog up the courts and tribunals but they also can have inhumane and inequitable consequences. As well, these delays can be manipulated by individuals as a way to artificially extend their stay in order to get privileges such as work rights, Medicare and other abuses of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When RRT matters go to the Federal Court, the average duration of the judicial process is now 354 days, while the IRT appeals to the Federal Court are taking an average 488 days to complete. To compound this situation, recourse to the courts is tending upwards. There were 398 cases in 1994, 630 cases in 1995-96 and there have been 574 cases so far in 1996-97. Based on current litigation trends and the estimated output of the IRT and the RRT in 1997&hyphen;98, it is anticipated that applications to the courts may rise to an expected 780-odd applicants in 1996-97 and over 900 in 1997-98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More significantly, at the present time around 90 per cent of these appeals fail. Future immigration policies therefore need to address these impediments and, at the same time, need to continue to serve both our national interests and our international responsibilities. In anticipation of the government's implementation of a more balanced immigration program, and reflecting these sentiments and ideals, the government is set to streamline the system in the best possible way to ensure that we have a proficient delivery of that particular program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill comprehensively addresses these problems with a three-pronged approach. Firstly, it seeks to limit the number of bodies that are able to review a decision. It merges the current two review bodies for non-refugee visa decisions&mdash;the Migration Internal Review Office, MIRO, and the Immigration Review Tribunal, IRT&mdash;into a new external review body called the Migration Review Tribunal, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7648"> MRT. Along with other measures, this will make the tribunals much more flexible and also reduce the scope for abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, Australia's continuing commitment to those seeking asylum on humanitarian or political grounds who meet the definition of a refugee under the refugee convention will still be able to seek the review of their case before the Refugee Review Tribunal. The aim of these bodies will be to deliver a flexible, efficient and cost&hyphen;effective procedure relevant to their jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, and more radically, the original bill that was introduced brings a new mechanism into the judicial review scheme to streamline this review process. It will achieve this by means of a privative clause. The government removed that from schedule 4 of the current bill and has now introduced it into Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5). This will restrict access to judicial review of a decision by the Federal Court and, to the extent that it will be able, by the High Court in all but the most exceptional circumstances: that is, where a government official or body making a primary decision has done so essentially unconstitutionally outside their jurisdiction or in bad faith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clause restricts access to judicial review but does so while still preserving an applicant's democratic right of appeal to the IRT, its successor the MRT and the RRT. As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has pointed out, this mechanism will have the practical effect of reducing the cost to the Australian community of successive appeals by non-citizens and of discouraging those seeking to further delay their lawful removal from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, as well as other measures to be introduced, there are restrictions on work rights, review application periods and a change in the structure of the review application fees. These will complement the main legislative change to ensure a streamlined program which is democratic, efficient and cost effective in its delivery. The bill also introduces time limits in which one may apply for a review of a decision as well as restricting those who can apply. This will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have the effect of ensuring certainty and efficiency in resolving outside issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another mechanism to aid in the control of those who are allowed into Australia is the visa cancellation power. A visa may now be cancelled where it was previously granted on the basis of incorrect information. Since being elected to government, the coalition has instituted programs aimed at resolving many of the problems inherited from the previous Labor government. Over the last year the government has moved to identify and eliminate abuse of migration and temporary entry visas and to implement a considerable number of measures to ensure that migration and temporary entry programs work well for business. It has done so while balancing a commitment to its program and policy which is non-discriminatory on the grounds of race, religion, ethnicity and country of origin, at the same time recognising the importance of the family reunion and humanitarian components.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important at this time to make some comments about some myths that have been raised by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). It is quite interesting that the member for Oxley comes into the House regularly and speaks about our immigration program. The member for Oxley is aware that in the parliamentary system there are a number of committees. On those committees, of which I am a member of some, particularly the Joint Committee on Migration, there are a number of people from the opposition side of the House as well as from the Australian Democrats who contribute and carry out very valuable work. She would be most welcome to join some of those committees instead of speaking about things of which she clearly has a lack of understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to mention some of those areas. In her contribution to this debate today she mentioned that migrants bring diseases into the country, which I find absolutely astounding. There is more of a chance of Australians going overseas and bringing diseases back into the country than the other way round. Migrants have, as part of the procedure for entering the country, very stringent health checks, particularly X-rays. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7649"> They have a considerable number of health checks before they come into the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work rights and Medicare were some of the issues she also touched on. As she would be well aware, there is a two&hyphen;year waiting period now for migrants who arrive in Australia after 4 March 1997. She also spoke about criminals being allowed into the country and how it was our duty to get rid of them. The member for Oxley may not be aware that in the last sitting the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill passed through the House, which dealt with the international transfer of prisoners. I would like to highlight that and bring that to her attention. This government has provided legislation to remove people who have committed a crime in this country and to repatriate them back to their country of origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the information of the member for Oxley, the migration committee is also investigating the deportation of people who have been found committing offences in Australia. Yes, the system does need tightening up, but there are some changes being made. Following this inquiry, people who have committed a crime in Australia will be able to be deported and they will never be allowed to return to Australia. That inquiry is going on at the moment. It is quite interesting to hear the member for Oxley speak about these things when we have, in fact, introduced the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill in the last sittings. I hope she makes herself familiar with that bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment is an important issue that keeps being raised. There is hysteria that somehow immigrants cause unemployment. The migration committee that I was on has just brought out a report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working holiday makers: more than tourists</EMPHASIS>. That report dealt with people on working holiday visas, who make a valuable contribution to the tourism of this country. At the moment they are allowed to work for three months in Australia and a number of the jobs that they take on are in harvesting and fruit&hyphen;picking areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody here wanted to take those jobs on. There is a real problem, particularly in harvest regions, with Australians not wanting to work in those areas. The working holiday program 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the people on working holiday visas play a very valuable role in ensuring that we have our fruit and vegetables harvested&mdash;something that was clearly highlighted in that working holiday visa report that I was able to work on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The myths that are peddled are absolutely unbelievable. The member for Oxley should also be aware that our population is actually in decline at the moment. Australia is going to face somewhat of a crisis situation in the year 2041. At the moment our birth rate is declining at an incredible rate. I believe it is 1.8 at the moment, and we should really have a rate of 2.1 per female. This means that by the year 2041 the death rate will exceed the birth rate. We need to address that problem through a balanced immigration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on the hard work that he has put into this bill. He has proactively addressed a number of the problems through implementing a number of measures. I know that he will continue to examine those problem areas. I  congratulate the minister on his fine work to date. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the member for Batman (Mr Martin  Ferguson) on his new responsibilities and I welcome him to the task. I served a time as shadow minister for immigration in earlier parliaments and had the pleasure of developing a very close and, I think, effective working relationship with those who I can now call my predecessors as ministers&mdash;Senator Ray and Gerry Hand. We accorded them cooperation to ensure that the Migration Act was capable of achieving the government's objective. On very few occasions did we dissent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to some major reforms of the Migration Act, there were two amendments for which I think I can claim some credit in my discussions with Senator Ray. The major bill and the major reform in migration law were achieved cooperatively. Likewise, I can 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7650"> recall only one occasion when there was a disallowance of regulations. I have not had that pleasure yet. Largely, regulations go through in a cooperative spirit. I look forward to having a dialogue with the shadow minister, when I can explain the nature of the changes that we are intent on pursuing, and to achieving a cooperative outcome where we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to thank the large number of honourable members who have participated in this debate today. In addition to the honourable member for Batman, I thank the members for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), Calwell (Dr Theophanous), Griffith (Mr McDougall), Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), Dunkley (Mr Billson), Petrie, Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and Oxley (Ms Hanson). I welcome their contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to have a debate at times and to listen to what is being said. While I was not here for all of those who spoke, I have listened very carefully to what has been said. I hope that those who are not here for this part of the reply, which is part of the dialogue that occurs in these matters, are listening in another place to what I have to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope they listened well to the member for Petrie, who in her comments brought out the need for some care in the way in which people contribute to debate in this area. It is important to have the dialogue, because sometimes remarks may not be made with a deliberate intention to mislead. Perhaps people are genuinely innocent when they misstate some propositions over and over again. I would like to think that the debate in the parliament can produce an outcome where people who are perhaps in ignorance of the way in which some of these issues are dealt with can become better informed and contribute more appropriately to the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that spirit I welcome the constructive dialogue we have had on the  Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 . I hope that when I have an opportunity to talk to the shadow minister about what we are seeking to do through the privative clause we may be able to come to some accommodation. I certainly have no objection to there being a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> review to bring out some of the facts. If that is going to be done through a Senate committee, so be it. That does not unduly trouble me. That is one of the reasons I have agreed to the separation of this issue from the other matters&mdash;so that we can proceed with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would encourage the honourable member to again read the speech of the honourable member for Kooyong. He pointed out some of the problems that Gerry Hand in particular had with the issue of judicial review, particularly in refugee decisions. One of the things the honourable member for Oxley said that is in fact correct is that if you look at the international convention in relation to refugees and the various covenants and other documentation associated with it, there is an expectation that you will not only consider people's claims and you will not refuse people who are entitled to protection. That is an obligation that we accept and one which I am strongly committed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an obligation to provide review, but there is no obligation to provide review both of an administrative character and in relation to providing additional access to the courts. The obligation is to provide one or the other but not both. One of the difficulties that we experience in this area&mdash;I think the only other area that has been likened to it is the area in relation to tax decisions&mdash;is that generally speaking when people access judicial review or administrative review they do not achieve their immediate outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal seeking a pension, it is rejected and you take it on appeal, you do not get paid a pension in the meantime; you wait until the appeal is dealt with. But what if your principal intention is to enter Australia and work here temporarily&mdash;in other words, if people are seeking to access Australia merely as a guest worker? I have to say the people who lodge asylum claims or who use the appeal system are very often people whose principal intention is to be a guest worker, who has permission to work. We made some changes to that recently, with the cooperation of the opposition. They know they should make application immediately they come in the door; if they can delay the determination of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7651"> decisions in relation to their status they can achieve what is in fact their principal objective&mdash;the objective of being here and being able to work for a period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that that is why the courts themselves are the subject of a great deal of abuse; abuse which is exemplified by the fact that large numbers of people lodge applications with the Federal Court and, at the end of the day, do not pursue them. They withdraw at a point in time when they realise the game is up. But that can sometimes be a year or so down the track when the objective of being here and in the work force has been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make these points because there are some important objectives that we are seeking to achieve. They are not to deny refugees refugee status. If a person has a well&hyphen;founded fear of persecution I expect my department to be able to identify that in the first instance. I know there are cases in which there can sometimes be some argument. There can be some marginal cases. I do not think there are all that many, but I expect that through an independent merits review process, through the Refugee Review Tribunal, those people will be properly identified. But to go beyond that with a series of further applications which can often be pressed can, in my view, be very much the subject of abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take the opportunity to deal with several matters that arose out of the discussion. I will not reply to all the points that have been made by honourable members, but I do want to say in relation to the matters that will be the subject of government amendments that I will propose that these matters were raised with me by the honourable member for Kooyong. The amendments were developed during the recess as a result of the points that were made by the honourable member for Kooyong. Well meaning though it may have been, I have to say the member for Calwell did not speak to me about it. I have to say that the honourable member for Batman's predecessor spoke to me about one issue; that is, the issue of separating out the privative clause, on which we reached agreement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some suggestions that there may be dangers in allowing the principal member to reconstitute cases. What we have sought to do is point out the circumstances in which the principal member will be involved in reconstituting cases and provide a system of consultation in relation to those. The purpose&mdash;and there is a purpose involved in this&mdash;is to ensure that if a member cannot for some reason deal with a case&mdash;it might be because of the complexities of the issue, it might because of the capacity of the member; a whole lot of issues can lead to very lengthy delay&mdash;the matter is not delayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was pointed out that simply giving the principal member the power to deconstitute a member may itself, in certain circumstances, be open to abuse. I recognise that. Therefore, we sought to identify the sorts of circumstances in which it may be appropriate for this to happen and establish a consultative method by which the principal member would have to consult with the senior member in each state or the deputy and with the member concerned. In other words, this sort of issue should not arise because the principal member would go to the person concerned and say, `Look, there's a problem here. We've identified that this matter is not being dealt with. How can we see it through?' I imagine just the fact that there is a power there will be enough in itself to ensure that the sorts of problems that I have been concerned about will not arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, in relation to the need for guidelines as to when matters can be dealt with without a hearing, we have essentially sought to ensure that it relates to those circumstances. I must say I am still of the view that there ought to be a wider range of circumstances. But, recognising there were some concerns, I have not pressed that&mdash;I have to say that. Nevertheless, these are very minimal provisions that deal with situations where a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7652"> person is deliberately not cooperating with the hearing of a matter. If the person wants the hearing, they will have the hearing, but it has to be in the context of cooperating with ensuring that it is able to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter that I want to deal with in the few moments remaining to me relates to the comments made by the honourable member for Batman about the government's anti&hyphen;racism campaign. I will have some things to say about this matter from time to time. I have made it clear that at the moment I am looking at a number of submissions in relation to the way in which we will undertake the market research for the campaign. There is a wealth of material available about racism. There is a wealth of material available about community attitudes to these sorts of issues. But there is not a wealth of material&mdash;in fact, there is a dearth of experience everywhere in the world&mdash;about how you can shift public opinion on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to be in a position, in this campaign, to do something that has really not been tried effectively anywhere in the world. I know there are some people who will not be happy unless you go out and essentially identify those who are racists and give them a whacking big thump. But the fact is that all of the experience that we have had with campaigns to date and all of the consultations that we undertook suggested that any campaign that involved going out there and essentially trying to thrash people for being racists would not achieve its objective. In fact, it would be totally counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to waste money by putting in place a program that is not going to achieve its objective. That is the only response I can offer. I know there are people who feel so hurt by a lot of what has been said and what has been done that they want to know that the government is out there with them and supporting them; and it is only when somebody is being thumped that they feel there is something happening. I know that is what they feel, and I know how hurt they feel. But I have to say that spending the money in that way would be totally counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some other comments have been made about the immigration program. I dealt with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those earlier in relation to some of the observations made by the member for Oxley. We have now produced a document&mdash;and I think it is a very worthy document&mdash;entitled `Dispelling myths about immigration'. It is part of a fact sheet arrangement which has been put together by my department to deal with many of the myths that are propagated. I noticed that the member for Petrie was using some of this information. I want to ensure that these matters are debated in a sound and sensible way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the comments by the honourable member for Batman in his opening remarks which recognised that there can be areas in which there may be disagreement, particularly the size of the program and some of the compositional issues. I do not apologise for that. I think that is an appropriate area in which we ought to be able to have dialogue. But when it comes to this blatant misrepresentation in relation to health issues, in relation to people's criminal propensity, let us focus on what the facts are. Sure, there are some shortcomings in dealing with character issues. I have identified some of those and I hope that, with regard to the amendments that will be brought forward during this session, the opposition will accord the legislation priority status. We will try to get it in so that we can deal with those people of concern who may get through the system inadvertently. I think that is a gap that needs to be addressed and I will be bringing forward very positive proposals to deal with those sorts of questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude my remarks by saying that I welcome the very positive contributions from my many colleagues who spoke. They reflected a very significant and welcome level of understanding of the complexity of some of these issues, and some of the problems of abuse that we are endeavouring to deal with. I welcome the shadow minister's offer of cooperation in these matters. I extend to him, as I have done personally, an offer to ensure that on these questions we are not debating non&hyphen;issues; if there are real questions, they can be brought out into the open.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Honourable members will recall that this bill seeks to amend the Migration Act to implement a number of the government's important policy initiatives within the immigration and multicultural affairs portfolio, particularly in relation to merits and judicial review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms in relation to merits review set the framework for reductions in both the time and cost of reviewing migration, visa and onshore refugee decisions. The government is putting forward amendments which will modify the proposed reforms in two areas and provide additional flexibility for the Refugee Review Tribunal in a third area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms in the bill introduced on 25 June 1997 include power for the principal member of both the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal to reconstitute a tribunal for a particular review. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> This would be done where the principal member believes it is necessary to do so for more efficient conduct of the review. The bill also provides each tribunal with discretion to determine whether a personal appearance by the review applicant would assist the tribunal's review of the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both of these reforms are aimed at enhancing the tribunals' ability to reduce delays in finalising reviews. Concerns have been raised that the principal members' reconstitution powers, which are proposed exclusively as an efficiency measure, could be used to influence the outcome of particular cases. In response, the government has decided to place qualifications on when these powers may be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is proposing amendments which will require the principal member to consult with the member or members constituting the tribunal and a senior member of the tribunal before a reconstitution direction may be made. Following these consultations, the principal member will be able to make a direction only if he or she is satisfied that there is insufficient material before the tribunal for it to make a decision, or if a prescribed time has elapsed since the tribunal was constituted for that review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under existing legislation, review applicants are entitled to an opportunity to appear before the Immigration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal in most circumstances. The government has been sensitive to concerns that this right will no longer exist. We are responding by introducing amendments which will retain this right but with limited qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments provide that applicants will be invited to appear before the tribunal unless a decision favourable to the applicant may be made on the papers, or an applicant consents to the review proceeding without an appearance, or the applicant fails to respond to the tribunal's invitation to provide additional material or comments. This may result in some loss of productivity gains expected in the tribunals, and consequently it may take a longer time to finalise cases. However, the government expects these to be minimised through the principal members using their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7655"> enhanced powers to introduce more efficient review procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the bill also include changes to align the minister's power to appoint persons to act in a senior office of the Refugee Review Tribunal with the existing equivalent power in relation to acting appointments in the Immigration Review Tribunal and the power proposed in the Immigration Review Tribunal. This will allow the minister to appoint persons to act as senior members of the Refugee Review Tribunal for a period of up to 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, as honourable members are aware, the government earlier today introduced into this chamber Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997. It provides for the introduction of a new judicial review scheme for decisions under the Migration Act relating to the ability of non&hyphen;citizens to enter and remain in Australia. As this scheme is currently contained in schedule 4 of the bill which we are considering, an amendment is required to excise this schedule. Together, these bills remain an interrelated package of reforms to review immigration portfolio decisions, and I commend the amendments to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to some comments that were made by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou)&mdash;which perhaps I should have adverted to earlier&mdash;dealing with the directions power of the principal member, let me confirm that that directions power that we are giving in the bill that is before us is only for administrative purposes. It cannot be used on merit related issues. The only person who can give policy directions within the law&mdash;and that is subject to the act of regulations&mdash;is the minister under section 499.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not suggesting that I might not give some wider direction. That might well be the case. But I am obliged to table that in the parliament, and I am subject to parliamentary scrutiny in relation to that. The principal member is not involved in the process of determining the way in which individual members deal with merit related issues. I am not envisaging that there should be any change in relation to that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To a large extent the amendments moved by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) not only take up the issues raised by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) but, dare I say, also those of the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). It is almost as if we have a unity ticket on both sides of the House with respect to some of these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to this matter coming before the House, there were discussions between the government and the opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), with respect to these issues. There is one issue that I would like to raise with respect to amendments Nos 5 and 11.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I go to that, I will respond to some of the issues raised by the minister today in response to the debate. I would also like to compliment the honourable member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) on her contribution today. I think it was exceptionally important that a constructive and detailed response be made to some of the issues raised during the course of the debate with respect to what I regard as very important but also extremely sensitive issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset today I referred to a speech made by the President of the United States when he visited Australia in November of last year. To a large extent his words did not fall on deaf ears. They were words that were welcomed and respected by the majority of Australians. It would seem to me from the contribution of the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) today that, while she enjoyed attending the luncheon provided free of charge by the government when the President of the United States visited Australia, she chose to ignore the comments that he made with respect to the nature of Australia and what a great nation it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason&mdash;and I hope she is listening&mdash;I would again refer to the manner in which Mr Clinton marvelled at our success as a nation when he said, `I cannot think of a better place in the entire world, a more shining example of how people can come together as one nation and one community.' We have a wonderful reputation, and a repu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7656"> tation that a clear majority of members of this House will work together to maintain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although there will be differences between the government and the opposition from time to time, it is a very important policy for Australia not only to maintain but also, when circumstances permit, to expand in years to come. I am talking about the population needs of Australia. Australia is a marvel. It is a great nation, but it has also a greater capacity to further develop in years to come. In that context, I welcome the opportunity provided by the minister for further discussions as required on what are now our joint responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, from time to time there will be differences. It is also fair to say that from time to time there are differences on these issues on his side of the House in the same way in which there are differences on our side of the House with respect to these matters. That is not to suggest that either party is going to be obstructive; there will be genuine differences. It is about developing a balanced program that represents the needs and aspirations of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a debate about the size of the population intake from overseas from time to time, and a debate about the composition, but I will tell you what there will not be a debate about: the myths that exist with respect to most of these issues between the government and the opposition. For that reason, as I said at the outset, the honourable member for Petrie is to be commended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I object to some of the myths raised in the debate today by the honourable member for Oxley. In doing so, I would like to briefly refer to our record of achievement as a nation with respect to these issues. I quote from the documentation released by the government in recent days, `Dispelling the myths about immigration'. On page 1 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does immigration really benefit Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia would not have progressed to its current level of economic and social sophistication without the contribution of migrants. They have brought new ideas and new technology to our industries and business.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is far from the ignorance expressed by some people who participated in the debate today. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have brought new skills which are not taught, or are in short supply in Australia, expanding the nation's skills base as a result.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the Government recognises that there are both costs as well as benefits associated with immigration. That is why the Government considers it is essential that the intake be balanced and targeted in a way which is consistent with our economic, environmental and international objectives.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the objective, and constructive debate must occur in this parliament; it should not be about myths which are based on ignorance and a lack of understanding of the benefits of population policy in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS>  It then goes on to suggest:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This must be achieved within the Government's over&hyphen;riding commitment to an immigration policy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and I hope the member for Oxley is listening&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that does not discriminate on the grounds of race, religion, colour, sex or country of birth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For that very reason I again prompt the minister. The debate in the House today suggests that, no, we are not about thumping people over the head, trying to develop a sense of political correctness in Australia. But there is an obligation on the government to promote debate based on the facts so as to ensure that we dispel the myths once and for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That effectively means that you ought to take up, with some urgency, the issues that I raised today in my initial contribution going to the question of the anti&hyphen;racism campaign that your government has promised the community. Simplistic slogans and pointing the finger by a minority in the community, at the time of a lack of security in people's lives, requires leadership at a government level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are to dispel those myths and build back into Australian society a sense of security, and on the basis of that sense of security create further opportunities for economic and social development in Australia, then you do not thump people over the head, you take the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7657"> ball up to them. That effectively means pursuing a balanced and objective anti&hyphen;racism campaign, based on a proper understanding of the facts, in an endeavour to ensure that we build even greater support into the huge support that currently exists in the Australian community, and into the achievements of our population and immigration policy of years gone by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the amendments before the House, as the minister said, pursue a range of problems with the original drafting which were raised by members on both sides of the House in the course of today's debate. The issue I raise is clearly of some concern to a number of people in the community. It goes to ensuring that, in the case of the principal member acting with respect to the new&hyphen;found powers, those powers must be used in a very cautious way. It gives the principal member significant additional powers, but I think there is an obligation to ensure that the principal member is not only cautious, but that, in exercising those powers, he or she is sensitive in the exercise of those powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The person with these new&hyphen;found responsibilities must go out of his or her way to avoid any undue accusation of interference of any nature. Obviously, from time to time these powers will have to be exercised, but in doing so I also suggest that an endeavour must be made by the principal member to obtain agreement of the member or senior member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That must be the objective of the principal member. To do otherwise than to act in such a cautious and sensitive way will potentially&mdash;and maybe for the right or wrong reasons&mdash;leave the principal member open to accusations of interference without a proper basis. That is the issue that I raise this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in the course of this final contribution, to a large extent the government has taken up a number of the criticisms and suggested changes proposed by the opposition. The one outstanding issue in my mind at the moment is to ensure that the intent of giving the principal member these additional powers will ensure that they are acted on in a cautious and sensitive way, and that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> principal member goes out of his or her way to ensure that there is agreement with the senior member or the member when these powers are exercised.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I may, I will take up a matter about which a degree of difference has emerged between the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and myself. Let me make it abundantly clear that what I launched on Friday was a major initiative on behalf of the government dealing with the very questions that he said needed to be dealt with&mdash;that is, dispelling the myths about immigration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been doing this over many months, and I think the arguments are getting through. Since September 1996, I have been ensuring that, when people put their heads up and make comments about the immigration program which are clearly flawed, those matters are addressed. The reason that the government&mdash;and I on behalf of the government&mdash;launched this publication was to do exactly what the member said, that is, address the myths. We are spending money on ensuring that that is done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the honourable member wants more of those kits for distribution he can let me know; they are available. I am inviting every member to use more of these kits. If I have to go back and do another print re&hyphen;run I will do it, because I want to ensure that this information is distributed as widely as possible. Our sincerity in relation to this matter will be determined by how we use the material rather than by the points we try to score about what might be suggested that others are not doing on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it abundantly clear that the anti&hyphen;racism campaign is not intended to dispel the myths about immigration; it is intended to try to shift public opinion in a meaningful way about very complex and difficult issues, namely, racial discrimination and racial vilification. This program was developed by us when we were in opposition to address some underlying problems without resort to the much more draconian methods that others 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7658"> were proposing ought to be used&mdash;namely, criminal sanctions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our purpose is to ensure that, when this money is spent, it is spent and achieves it objective. The real concern I have had all the way through&mdash;and it has been compounded as I have gone through the exercise of trying to look at how we undertake the market research task&mdash;is that the ways and means of doing this could well exacerbate problems if you do not get it right.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very complex and very difficult. I thank the honourable member for his observation about it. I am happy to talk to you about the sort of process that I am going through in trying to look at the ways and means of dealing with this issue. I have to say the concern that I have, coming through a number of sessions I have had with market research consultants, is that there are different techniques and different ways of eliciting this information. A lot of what is proposed has been done before and has not been adequate for the purpose. I have to find a way through so that we will make new and meaningful advances in an area in which there is not a great deal of international literature to demonstrate that people have been successful in relation to these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will deal briefly with the final matter. As I said, the honourable member for Kooyong raised these matters with me. The amendment we have is quite precise. It says that the principal member can only deal with these matters if he has consulted with the person who is involved. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> You cannot give the member who is involved, where there is a concern that he or she has been unable to reach a decision, a veto over whether or not reconstitution can occur. If it is a difficulty that needs to be dealt with, then the matter will come out in the discussions that occur. If it is because the member concerned has had perhaps some difficulties in coming to grips with some complex issues and has been putting matters off&mdash;and those things do occur&mdash;then I suspect that the consultation in most cases will deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, what I said in the course of the debate is my view. I suspect that simply 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> having the power here may be sufficient. What will happen is that the consultations that do occur and have to involve the principal member and the senior member will work out what the problem is, and people will find a way of ensuring that the difficulty that has perhaps not been talked about but has occasioned reaching the decision is in fact addressed and may bring other people's minds to bear as to how that shall be done. In other words, I do not expect that this power will be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member said that it might be used rarely. I suspect that this power, once it is there, will probably never be used, but it will be the basis upon which a member will be able to say, `We have to consult about this. I do have certain powers; let's work our way through it'&mdash;and they will be able to achieve an outcome. But, if there is no power there, he has no capacity to approach somebody to try to deal with that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason this amendment is there is that the principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal came to me about particular cases that have gone on for numbers of years where decisions were not being reached and where he had no capacity ultimately to be able to deal with those issues. I do not think the principal member should be left in that sort of situation. It is for that reason that we have proposed it in this limited form requiring consultation, requiring discussion and also providing for circumstances which may be seen as exceptional, such as insufficient material before the tribunal on which to reach a decision, which I think is the principal matter that would be offered as a reason why a case may not have been resolved.</PARA></SPEECH>

On that note I refer to the unanimous decision of the House of Representatives on 30 October 1996 to adopt a motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in regard to a statement on racial tolerance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From time to time I suggest that you do need to do market research, but perhaps some people are doing too much market research and not leading. A test of sincerity, as I suppose is now promoted and supported by the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, leading business people across a range of industries and the Premier of Victoria, is whether or not all in this House have sufficient commitment to overcoming racial vilification and discrimination in Australia to make a decision that I do not believe ought to be based on market research and polling but, more importantly, based on what is in the best interests of all Australians. It is about time all political parties represented in the Senate and the House of Representatives resolved that we jointly put Hanson last. No polling&mdash;it is a question of sincerity; put up or shut up once and for all.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R256">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 [No. 2]</XREF>  typifies the complexity and indeed the inequalities of the tariff reduction regime now in place around the world and demonstrates clearly the unwise path Australia has taken to be first out there onto the level playing field&mdash;the world series economic rationalist team from down under. This bill demonstrates the schizophrenia of the current world trade system: it increases the rate of duty from the level playing field free status on imports of certain Canadian petrochemicals in retaliation for Canada extending to several of its developing country trading partners preferential rates of duty on Canadian imports of raw sugar; it looks after the developing economy status of territories administered by the Palestinian Authority by allowing developing country tariff status to those territories; and it slices $55 a tonne off support for our sugar industry long in advance of the timetable set in our trading agreements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If we cannot strike a level playing field arrangement with our Commonwealth of Nations and former empire ally Canada, I respectfully suggest there is precious little chance of achieving the reductions in tariffs from developing nations according to the timetable set out under GATT and the Uruguay Round. Canada's and, to the same extent, New Zealand's eagerness to disparage our quarantine protection as nothing more than non-tariff barriers show how naive we are in expecting such cooperation from more hostile trading partners. If these are your friends, who needs trading enemies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of the duty on imports of sugar and certain sugar by-products has not, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) suggested, received strong support from the industry for the full implementation of the integrated package of reforms of which this tariff reduction is part. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7660"> Governments and manufacturers have welcomed the removal of the duty in the name of a competitive industry and access to sugar at world prices. But growers see it as an unnecessary and unsustainable loss of revenue with nothing in return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) so eloquently detailed that argument in this House last night when he argued how our highly efficient industry is being asked to compete on a level playing field against competition that has a 193 per cent subsidy. Again, the hoary old benefit to local consumers is dragged out as an argument&mdash;as it was, incidentally, in the argument about motor vehicles. Freezing protection in that industry has now created hundreds more jobs with Toyota's increased investment in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) pointed out in a 90-second statement this week, she does not believe that Australian consumers will complain about shoe and clothing prices if they know they are protecting Australians jobs&mdash;nor would they complain about the cost of sugar. While the confectionery and soft drink manufacturers support the removal of the tariff, I might ask: how many of these are Australian owned? The growers ask how you can take millions of dollars straight out of the bottom line of the economy, hit every other industry besides sugar in these sugar growing areas, risk an industry with 45,000 direct and indirect jobs and allow it to be replaced by highly subsidised exports, because that, inexorably, is what will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After questioning the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the impact of reducing tariffs on textiles, clothing and footwear and how that might affect regional areas like Lithgow which has just seen the loss of Berlei bra factory due to ever reducing tariffs, I received a copy of a document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade Liberalisation: how Australia gains</EMPHASIS> from the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer). We all know what a hardworking and dedicated trade minister he is, embarking on an exhausting round of trade missions to all points of the compass, and we know he is a passionate disciple of free trade. This document is a fascinating one. It states 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that trade liberalisation has increased the range of imports and made them cheaper for Australian consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> That is exactly why Berlei is heading to Indonesia and cannot afford to stay in Australia. The imported bras from China, Indonesia and other developing countries&mdash;protected as they are from the level playing field rules&mdash;are taking out our jobs by the thousands. We are told the gains from free trade have added an average $1,000 to the annual income of each Australian family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to economic modeller Chris Murphy, the prospective gain in living standards from the proposed tariff reduction in the automotive industry, which the government thankfully rejected, was about $50 million or 0.02 per cent and that was at a cost of losing 21 per cent of market share and 21,000 automotive jobs. Those jobs would not be soaked up, as the economic modellers would have it, by job gains in other industries elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept the argument that there is no future hiding behind a Fortress Australia mentality forever. I accept the fact we cannot pull up the drawbridge, whether it be for tariffs or for immigration. But we must slow down. We are radically changing the face of the workplace at home while at the same time rapidly dismantling industry protection in the so-called interests of a better world down the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the electorate are confused; in fact, they are angry. They are looking for alternatives, as I have suggested before, that do not have answers and they are asking plenty of questions. These people are not seeing the benefits. Even those who are not flirting with any other political persuasion are not seeing answers. This is despite the Prime Minister's assertion that we have created 1.8 million jobs in the service industries since 1984 and only 5,000 in the industrial, mining and agriculture sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what sorts of jobs have been created? Financial services generating stock market analysts, screen jockeys and foreign currency dealers&mdash;granted, a highly rewarded concentration of wealth generators, but such wealth does not filter down through the labour 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7661"> market&mdash;or perhaps tourist industry jobs which are part time and often lowly paid, jobs where two part-time workers are far cheaper to employ than one full&hyphen;time worker. That might seem okay, but we have a gross underemployment in this country. On top of our 800,000 or thereabouts officially unemployed people, we have a growing number of the working poor. The fact is that one hour a week constitutes employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 100 workers at the Lithgow Berlei factory were all, bar one, women. For half of them, their wages were the only income coming into the household. They were a cheap work force in a town battered by the economic rationalist forces of the past 15 years where downsizing, rationalisation, corporatisation and outsourcing&mdash;all the catchcries of the textbook economists&mdash;had carved their way through this regional city's economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ADI, Australian Defence Industries, along with the electricity industry in the area are soon to be privatised, it seems, with more job losses. There have been State Rail jobs and state road jobs lost&mdash;the people of Lithgow have seen it all&mdash;and now there is the impact of reduced tariffs. Forget the five per cent tariff protection by the year 2008; Berlei Lithgow is unable to compete, so it says, with imports at the current 34 per cent rate of protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These women are super efficient at what they do. Their product is superb. So superb and so good are their work practices that they were videoed by the company. That video was then used in Indonesia to show the $5 a day workers there how the $80 a day workers in Australia do their job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Retrain these local workers,' say the rationalists. I ask you: how and where can we retrain people for the high-tech information industry when their skill base is machining, when they have never worked with a computer, when their education levels at school are school certificate at best and when many are middle aged? Can we really retrain sugar growers, citrus growers or banana producers in the Ord whom I met a month ago?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Education,' I hear someone say. But this is at a time when we are cutting away the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education opportunities for the young, the uneducated and the unskilled, let alone the middle aged. What about labour market programs? They have been gutted too. Only the cream are really catered for by the new privatised labour market system where bounties are paid for training and jobs placement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I argue that there is no room in the new labour force for the women of Berlei Lithgow. They provided captive labour in a captive market on the outskirts of Sydney but across the sandstone curtain from where they could not escape. They were the last pool of local labour for Berlei en route to the Third World. Berlei is a company with fickle community responsibility&mdash;like BHP&mdash;and with little regard to the support it has been given by the taxpayer over the years. It heads offshore to maximise shareholders' dividends; it is too bad for the work force and the community that had provided that stable and loyal labour for 50 years. No wonder the average worker is questioning both Labor and coalition policy over the past decade and a half.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The free traders at any cost might argue that Australia has made commitment in APEC to establish a regime of free trade and investment by 2010. I say, `Some fool us.' Do we really expect China to hop aboard; do we really believe Malaysia and Indonesia will drop protection for their fledgling car industries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some say our farmers are the ones who `will suffer' from a continued tariff regime. They are suffering now. The low protection farm community, the most competitive and efficient in the world, is being played for a sucker by the giants of world trade&mdash;the US, the European Union and Japan. Our vertically integrated meat industry is vertically integrated in favour of its mostly foreign ownership. Our most efficiently produced meat derives a return for the farmer no farther than the farm gate, while the processor, wholesaler and retailer make a killing. But most of those are offshore. Only a fraction of that money remains to benefit Australians or, most importantly, the farmer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to many experts the reason protectionism has flourished for so long is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7662"> that free trade&mdash;although it offers overall benefits, according to these experts&mdash;can be detrimental in the short term to some sectors and individuals. This is the `follow me and all will be revealed' philosophy. The level playing field is just around the corner. Let us exorcise these anti&hyphen;free trade demons as quickly as possible, so the argument goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that just around the corner are any number of international muggers. They are laughing at our naivety at being out there on the streets alone so unprotected. For even while we preach the virtues of free trade, our Prime Minister has a bob or two each way. In October last year, he admitted that industry would be entitled to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have done our part, we have borne the brunt of reduced protection . . . We have engaged in a lot of give&hyphen;ups, we'd like a few give&hyphen;ups in return.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What about a `you too' trade policy? The Australian Democrats have called for future tariff cuts to be directly linked with those undertaken by other countries. The government should produce reports comparing Australia's tariff levels with those of other countries. I endorse such a policy as a bare minimum prerequisite for any further consideration of tariff reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all know, as tariff levels have dropped in recent years, as they have been removed, governments&mdash;except ours&mdash;have turned to other ways to restrict import competition. The European market is also re&hyphen;erecting quotas. The US can bung on an abattoir health crisis in this country, if it sees fit, in order to off&hyphen;load an excess of feedlot beef when grain prices rise. No-one really has the interests of free trade at heart when the advantages are not all their way. And the ultimate object of import replacement&mdash;if taken to its logical conclusion&mdash;would obviate international trade anyway. People will only trade when there is an absolute advantage their way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There is a lesson in the words of Sir John Crawford in his report to the Fraser government in 1979:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any general program of tariff reductions should not be implemented while unemployment stays above five per cent. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly we should be addressing the domestic problems first. Unemployment not tariff reduction is our No. 1 and, I would say, our paramount economic problem. To add to the uncertainty and fear of job security is callous in the extreme and also unnecessary because we have met our commitments to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well to talk about restructuring and international competitiveness. Berlei restructured, downsized and developed new technologies but, even with 34 per cent protection, it still cannot compete. It has exported not only those 180 jobs at Lithgow but also the technology which it devised and its expertise to Indonesia. Berlei's own senior staff is now training the $5 a day labour force offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that open economies are the best for countries that want to export. But that is only in the purest model when everyone is playing the game, which they do not. The international price, unfortunately, is not a neat intersection of supply and demand curves. It is distorted and corrupted by any number of forces working against those naive enough to think pure market forces are at work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told by the market economists that, all things being equal, market forces will prevail. But the world market is decidedly unequal. We are told that lower protection and restructuring of the industry mean that assistance is needed for employees who are disadvantaged and for new entrants to the work force who may need further training. It means the dole for the workers at Berlei. There is no training in the work for the dole scheme and there are precious little training options left in the labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill covers the removal of duty on imports of sugar, gives favoured status to imports from Palestinian territories and penalises Canada for unfair and unlevel playing field behaviour. It covers all the issues. It gives away advantages to our own producers; it assists, perhaps rightly and generously, a country needing a trade leg&hyphen;up; and it admits, as in the Canadian exercise, that the playing field is not level and never will be whenever a country wants a trading advantage&mdash;and that is all the time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7663">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Trade points to his trade liberalisation pamphlet on how Australia gains from tariff reduction and to the fact that the World Trade Organisation is a benevolent institution benignly looking after the interests of all parties in the family of trading nations. As we swallow that, let me quote from some statistics in an article last year by Mr B.A. Santamaria:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . these policies of deregulation, privatisation, tariff cuts and so on . . . have been tried for more than 13 years. They have further enriched the wealthiest 10 per cent of the community . . . they have simultaneously created more than one million unemployed . . . 25 per cent of young Australians can't even get into the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Meanwhile, during the past decade the real wage of the bottom 10 per cent of wage earners has fallen by 5 per cent. In 1973 a mere 12 point 5 per cent of the population was in receipt of social services. Today it is 23 per cent. We are assured it will all come good in the long term. But as John Maynard Keynes once remarked, "in the long run we are all dead".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The workers at Berlei Lithgow will be economically dead long before the rest of us. The sugarcane growers are now asked to give up their remaining protection on the altar of a free trade policy that our trade department and Treasury bureaucrats believe in but which has no support out there in the regions where real products are grown, where real goods are made, where some real jobs survive for the moment and where economic theory is treated with the contempt it deserves&mdash;a situation the member for Kennedy recognised when he voted with his conscience in this House a few weeks back and gave the sugar tariff removal the thumbs down it deserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dilemma facing the National Party was amply illustrated last night in the diametrically opposing views of the member for Kennedy and the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) on this bill. I suspect that there are others on the government back bench caught in a bind but unwilling, unlike the member for Kennedy, to speak out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have met our international trading obligations however distorted those obligations are. I serve notice that I will be opposing the amendments relating to the removal of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> customs duty from sugar and certain sugar by&hyphen;products not because protection is necessarily so sacred but because the alternative&mdash;free trade&mdash;is by any judgment never likely to be free for a country like Australia caught as it is between the huge economies of scale of the major economies out there and the slave labour pay rates and no workplace controls of the developing economies against which we cannot compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have done enough. We must ask our competitors and trading partners to at least catch up before we give any more ground.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R256">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 [No. 2]</XREF>  and, in particular, on the Commonwealth's decision to remove the tariff. I would like to outline to the House the reasons why the Commonwealth has made the decision, particularly the background to the decision, and the attitudes that were put in place by the sugar industry working review party&mdash;attitudes which all members of the parliament who are speaking on this bill should read. I suspect the majority of them have not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to demonstrate to the House the importance of the sugar industry in Australia. There are over 6,500 cane growers in Queensland, 550 in New South Wales, and 22 in the Ord region&mdash;a much smaller number. But the real issue is the value of its contribution to the Australian economy. In northern New South Wales, the area I represent, the sugar industry is a $65 million industry directly; the multiplier effect sends it to over $200 million. In Queensland it is a $2 billion industry and the multiplier effect is far greater with a huge number of people employed in the industry, ranging from Rocky Point all the way to north of Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we are having this debate on the tariff is interesting, because the largest sugar producing state, Queensland, which produces 95 per cent of the crop, and its industry leaders, recommended to the Commonwealth that it remove the tariff. That is the key difference from the TCF industries, the automotive industry or other areas where industry groups have been advocating to the government to maintain tariffs. There were 74 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7664"> recommendations, two of which had Commonwealth implications, and all were approved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were over 700 submissions which went into this report by the working party that was established by the previous ALP state and federal governments. The key terms of reference were to review the need for the tariff on raw and refined sugar and to review the current legislative arrangements for the promotion and regulation of sugar in Queensland. Further, the review was to be conducted within the terms of national competition policy. National competition policy was established by the Australian Labor Party government. They were the champions of it under the Hilmer reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To quote Harry Bonnano, who is a leading identity in the sugar and cane growing industries, when the package was released:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The balance of package measures recommended by the working party and now accepted by the Government vindicates canegrowers consistently stated argument that total deregulation would have a disastrous effect on a $2 million a year export industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There were some decisions made within that working party. They wanted to maintain a single desk and they wanted to maintain consignment within the framework of national competition policy. Yes, they had to make some decisions and one of them was the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us look at the tariff question, because it is on that which so much of this argument hinges. Unlike what has happened to the automotive industry and potentially what is to happen with the TCF industries, there was no dissenting report by the leaders of the industry in supporting the tariff. When you go through them&mdash;whether it was Harry Bonnano; Graham Davies; Tony Gentile; the Commonwealth representative, Mr Newton; Mr O'Riley from the state; or Ron Verri from the Australian Cane Farmers Association&mdash;not one of them put in a dissenting report in regard to maintaining the tariff. This was fundamentally different from the review of automobile tariffs by the Productivity Commission. The only person who stepped out of the square there and was an advocate against 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Productivity Commission was Ian Webb. Indeed, the whole industry was behind tariff retention. That was not the case with the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole tariff debate was kicked off a number of years ago by that icon Gough Whitlam, who cut tariffs by 25 per cent, and he was followed by his disciples, Hawke, Keating, Beazley and Crean, in the 13 years of Labor Party stewardship. The fact is that the industry recommended to the government, even though the New South Wales industry was not a party to that group and should have been, that it remove the tariff in order to retain a number of other essential concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting point is that even if the tariff were put back on tomorrow, not just at $37 a tonne but perhaps at $1,000 a tonne, it would make no difference to the domestic price of sugar&mdash;a fact which has failed to be recognised by any member of the opposition or any Independent&mdash;because a fundamental change has happened to the pricing formula for sugar. The Queensland Sugar Corporation, which regulates 95 per cent of the sugar produced in Australia&mdash;it is the buyer&mdash;has changed its pricing formula. That was signed off by Trevor Perrett, the Minister for Primary Industry in Queensland, a number of months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The change in the pricing formula means that by changing back from import parity to export parity the tariff will have no effect. To date the tariff has been an artificial inflator of the domestic price of sugar, and with that change in the pricing formula it will have no impact. I would like to quote the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, which puts the matter fairly succinctly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as part of the Queensland Government's acceptance of the report of the Sugar Industry Review, chaired by Mr Bruce Vaughan, the Queensland Sugar Corporation would only pay domestic producers the export parity or world price. This fact alone will remove virtually all of the booty of high domestic prices previously underpinned by the import tariff. In large part, the tariff that Labor is now trying to wring political capital out of is irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the horse has bolted in that respect. The other issue that the sugar industry has been referring to, and which is important to this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7665"> debate, is the single desk. I have no doubt, and I know the member for Page (Mr Causley) certainly does not, that the single desk is a very valuable instrument in the Queensland sugar industry. The reason is that it stops unfair multinational companies giving a lower price to cane growers, and it also acts as a much more unified voice on export markets. Indeed, even Cuba is starting to think about going back to a single desk because it has a valuable influence on international markets. New South Wales, because of a decision that was made many years ago as a result of irreconcilable differences, exports on a much smaller scale, separate from the QSC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that, even with the single desk argument, many companies would like to see single desk selling removed. Bundaberg Sugar is one. There is now a defamation action against the Queensland Sugar Corporation by Mackay Sugar Corporation. Principally, the local cooperative in cooperation with the European commodities giant, E.D. &amp; F. Mann, an enormous refiner, are now bringing litigation against QSC on single desk selling. It needs to be kept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area in the recommendations which has caused considerable concern to growers in areas of North Queensland and around the Bundaberg district is the pooling differential. These were recommendations made by the sugar industry, not by the Commonwealth, and that is a key difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, when you look at the structure of this report you will see that the ALP put those people there under the national competition policy that they established under the son of Hilmer. The people they put there recommended that the tariff be removed. Incredibly, some of the representatives were inappropriate. Some of them represented the largest confectionary manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great tragedy in the debate today on national competition policy is the assumption that greater competition will mean lower prices and that consumers will benefit. The irony has been that, with the tariff reduction from over $100 per tonne down to $37 per tonne, you would think that consumer prices 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would have fallen. The facts are that since 1989 through to the December quarter last year, the price of confectionaries has gone up 52 per cent and the price of cordials and soft drinks has gone up 34 per cent. Obviously these are key products that require sugar. The CPI, though, has only gone up 29.5 per cent. It makes you wonder who is making the profits. That is why some of those people should not have been on that working party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the other arguments about free trade and global trade in relation to sugar. Sugar markets have been corrupted; there is no question about that. There are enormous subsidies&mdash;the EEC with 190 per cent and Thailand with over 107 per cent. The biggest consumers of sugar are either governments or otherwise within countries. A very small amount is taken by free traders. Australia has to live on that free trade. We export 85 per cent of our raw sugar and obviously we are increasing our refined capacity. That is the environment that we have to live in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The US market is a huge consumer of sugar. It has a regulated market and a quota&mdash;we have had the benefit of getting into that quota; we are the fourth largest importer on that quota&mdash;of 1.9 million tonnes. It is hoped that when the US farm bill comes back into Congress in the year 2001 the quota will be removed. As the member for Page has pointed out, if that quota is removed, it will effectively mean that the world price of sugar will increase by 2c to 3c a pound. Currently it is in the range of 11c to 12c. We must continue to advocate the removal of that quota. In the long term its removal will mean more to Australian cane farmers and to other global exporters than its retention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to be careful of substitutes. As I said, we could put our tariff back on tomorrow at $1,000 per tonne. But it would make no difference because of the change in the pricing formula. We also have to be competitive against other substitutes. Corn based starch represents the biggest proportion of sugar consumption. Ironically, the EEC is the largest producer of sugar&mdash;16.5 million tonnes, a major proportion from sugar beet&mdash;whereas Australia produces only five million tonnes. In the United States, corn based starch 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7666"> now represents seven per cent of the global consumption of sugar; artificial sweeteners represent five per cent. There are other factors that we have to be mindful of in the sugar argument, not just tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currency movements, which were advocated yesterday by the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), would have a far greater impact. That is precisely the reason why the Australian government decided to go in with a rescue package to support the baht. The last thing we wanted to see was the Thai baht plummet through the floor. This would have meant that they would be far cheaper for foreign buyers to purchase and it would have undermined our sugar industry dramatically. It was a swap that was done and it was prudent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, if you actually import sugar into Australia, there is a freight differential. So there are some strategic advantages, notwithstanding some of the arrangements that we put in place with the WTO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the New South Wales industry and focus on what has been achieved since the sugar task force report. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made an announcement&mdash;and a number of members of this government were involved&mdash;to ensure that there would be an adequate package for New South Wales to compensate it for the decisions made by the Queensland industry in this report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sugar: Winning globally</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of valuable concessions were gained. One was an additional $1 million worth of infrastructure to the New South Wales industry which matches the previous $1 million from the government and the $1 million from the state. This is to allow them to get into the export market. The other area&mdash;and it will be finalised shortly&mdash;is to gain access into the US market; to get New South Wales a slice of that very lucrative market which has been denied to it since 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, and most importantly, the decision that the federal government has made in regard to allowing the facility for a merge between Mackay and CSR will be the best thing that can happen to domestic prices in the short term, irrespective of any other decision made in the short term. The irony is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the national competition policy, which was established by the ALP, with the likes of Allan Fels and others, actually denied the merge back in the early 1990s. If that had not happened, we would not have an excess supply of sugar now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very reason we have an excess supply is that some refineries are producing enormous amounts of sugar. In order to gain market share they are discounting, and by discounting they are lowering the price so that all refineries lose money. I am delighted that we have been able to facilitate a situation where that merge can go ahead and where we can reduce excess supply and, in turn, the prices will move back up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another area within the sugar industry where there is a very positive future for sugar&mdash;this is happening both in New South Wales and in Queensland&mdash;and that is the diversification into power. A number of mills are putting in generators and, whilst the big end of town has been compensated because of national competition policy, this can also benefit the sugar industry. In New South Wales generators are being put in which can direct power directly into the grid. Of course, we are looking for an increase in production from an export of refined sugar. And, as I mentioned before, one of the key issues has been the resolution of the Mackay-CSR problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is interesting in this debate, though, is the attitude that the Australian Labor Party has taken. As I have portrayed, the sugar industry itself recommended that the tariff be removed in order to maintain concessions. As I have demonstrated, even if the tariff were put back into place, it would make no difference to the domestic price of sugar. Let me quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 7 March, which described Labor's approach as `the contemptuous opportunism of the Labor Opposition' and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sugar decision is exactly what the Federal Labor Party would now be proposing if it were still in government. The recommendation to scrap the tariff is from the unanimous report of the Sugar Industry Review Working Party, which includes representatives of both cane growers and the sugar users, that the Labor Party set up with the Queensland Government in 1995. Labor's new stance is an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7667"> example of the destructive role an opposition party can play in a populous lunge for votes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In this case, to grab a few seats in Queensland. So there you go: the ultimate hypocrisy. Even when Crean was there, that was precisely the policy that they were advocating, and now they have got this flip&hyphen;flop policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key difference between the automobile industry and the TCF industry is that the sugar industry has recommended the removal of the tariff, and members on the backbench should recognise that. The Labor Party is potentially jeopardising the gains that it achieved through maintaining the single desk and through maintaining consignment. I think it is absolutely deplorable, and it is one of the reasons why we are having this debate, that, although the Labor Party was in government for 13 years, it allowed a further concentration of foreign ownership, which is precisely what happened in the sugar industry and precisely what has happened in the beef industry.</PARA>

I understand that a similar arrangement will prevail in respect of Canada and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians have been deeply touched by the sudden loss of the princess and have given, in many forms, moving expression to our feelings for her and for the suffering that her family, particularly her children, must be enduring. The parliament has conveyed those sentiments to the family. Memorial services have been held throughout the country, including the one which I, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) attended in Canberra yesterday. The government naturally understands and respects the desire of the princess's family and the Royal family that the funeral have as strong a personal nature as possible and that as many personal friends and contacts from organisations with which she was closely associated should be able to attend.</PARA></SPEECH>

He has also indicated to me that he would seek that the opposition would also be appropriately represented in those circumstances. But it is quite evident that those responsible for the funeral want to keep it very much as personal an affair as such a funeral could be, with the people attending being those who had established a very close relationship with the late princess.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I stand exactly by my comments with regard to her dumb and divisive agenda. In the last financial year ending 30 June 1997 this nation had an all&hyphen;time record export effort of $104.4 billion with a surplus in both goods and services for the first time ever. Frankly, I do not think one container or 1 tonne of iron ore

Equally, I want to make it very clear, if Australia is to have a bread ticket into the next century, into the next millennium. it has to maintain a set of relations based best on mutual respect with our trading partners, most notably in Asia, which command about two&hyphen;thirds of our export effort.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the member for Dawson, I have seen reports of her comments. I do not believe she would want to jeopardise Australia's trade with Asia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me add one other thing only. I need to draw to the attention of the House that there has been a recent meeting between David Oldfield, the senior adviser to the member for Oxley, and Ian McNiven, the national vice&hyphen;president of the Firearm Owners Association of Australia, and Ron Owen, the publisher of

I simply say that an account of this particular meeting has been reported in the current edition of the magazine referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very much out of character for an organisation that professes to speak for ordinary Australians to be going around meeting with people who are on the record as being anything but ordinary and fair dinkum Australians. I do not want to give these people any more of a profile than they already have, but I want to make it very clear that it seems very unAustralian to me, and many Australian families must be left wondering what One Nation as a party and the member for Oxley have in common with people who go around hanging people in effigy, including office holders of the federal parliament, in front of gunshot targets.

I think all Australians will welcome strong growth in the Australian economy of 1.2 per cent in the June quarter. Importantly, what it showed was that growth was accelerating in the first two quarters of this year, recording 1.9 per cent in the first half of 1997 compared with 1.2 per cent in the second half of 1996. Abstracting from the farm sector, the step up in growth was even more marked.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today's national accounts also confirmed Australia's status as a low inflation country, the price deflators rising over the year by 1.4 per cent.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. When we came into office in March last year, the former Labor government had left untouched the Badgerys Creek airport site as Sydney's second airport. You will recall that the former Labor government selected Badgerys Creek in February of 1986 as the second airport site for Sydney. However, despite that decision, 10 years prior to the change of government, they had not done one thing to develop the airport&mdash;apart from talk about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, when we came into office, we started to implement our policies in regard to the management of Sydney's Mascot airport as well as, of course, the second airport. We said in opposition that the coalition supported the development of a second airport for Sydney. In doing so, we supported a full and comprehensive environmental impact study which would be oversighted, for the very first time in the history of this country, by an independent auditor to ensure a proper process for that EIS is undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of entering government, we were aware of a number of environmental concerns that had been expressed by people in regard to Badgerys Creek airport. In light of that, we stated at the announcement of the EIS that, whilst Badgerys Creek was our first preference for the second airport site for Sydney, we would run a parallel EIS on an alternative site based at Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the commencement of that EIS, a lot of work has been undertaken, and earlier today I was able to release the draft EIS executive summary and make that available for public consumption. The draft EIS completely dispels the concerns that many of us had when we came into office in regard to Badgerys Creek airport. The draft EIS clearly indicates that Badgerys Creek is a superior site. It also indicates that Holsworthy is an inferior site for a second airport for Sydney when compared with Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of that, I have approached the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, and sought to ensure that, from this point forward, Holsworthy will be excluded as a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> site for consideration for Sydney's second airport. This means that the EIS on a second airport for Sydney will proceed solely based on three options for an airport runway at Badgerys Creek. It also means that this presents Australia, particularly Sydney, with a unique opportunity to resolve an issue that has been plaguing Sydney since the end of the Second World War; that is, to develop a second airport to cope with the growth of aviation traffic in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be remembered that Sydney airport receives half of all Australia's overseas international arrivals. It is the most important piece of infrastructure for Australia's tourism industry, our largest export earner and our fastest job creator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As such, this unique opportunity of now being able to proceed to develop a second airport at Sydney is done with the support from the Labor Party. When in government, of course, they were the creators of the site at Badgerys Creek and, throughout their years in office, they strongly supported the development of an airport at Badgerys Creek. People like the member for Werriwa, the member for Watson, the member for Grayndler and the member for Kingsford-Smith have all stood up in this House over the years and strongly supported an airport at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the support of those Labor members, judging by what they did when in office, and we can also look forward to the support of a number of local communities&mdash;particularly the Liverpool City Council that has the Badgerys Creek airport in its boundaries. We can look forward now to strong support from the Labor Party and from individual communities for the development of an airport at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>

Why has the government spent nearly 18 months and some $5 million to determine that Holsworthy is a totally inappropriate site for an airport, when this question was conclusively resolved a decade ago? Isn't it a fact that the government's mad pursuit of the Holsworthy option upset and gave unnecessary heartache to thousands of residents in Sydney, forced many people to sell their homes at massively discounted prices and caused significant disruption to the Australian Defence Force? Isn't it a fact that much of the blame results from the coalition's desire to satisfy the Lawrence Hargreaves project? Will the minister now apologise to the residents of Sydney and advise what arrangements are going to be put in hand to compensate for the suffering as a consequence of the government's crazy pursuit of the bomb littered Holsworthy site?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

We wanted to ensure that we could fulfil our commitment in regard to developing a second airport in Sydney as soon as was practicable.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. The government's response to the Wallis inquiry, which was announced yesterday, has been broadly welcomed by the Australian public and the Australian financial industry. It has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7673"> particular benefits for people in rural and regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in rural and regional Australia where new non-bank financial institutions now, for the first time, will be able to compete on an equal basis with the banks. They will be giving increased services, increased competition, increased efficiency and better prices to the people of rural and regional Australia. Consumers will be the ones to benefit as a result of the government's structural reform of the Australian financial industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Removing the second&hyphen;tier status of credit unions and building societies will provide greater community acceptance for those institutions and will enhance their ability to give new financial services. This will only be helped by programs like credit care, where the government and the credit unions have teamed together to provide funds for project teams which have visited around 100 communities to see if they want full service financial institutions after the withdrawal of banking services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Credit union facilities have been established in 33 communities, with progress at various stages in around 30 of them. Direct employment has been created for 40 people, and new deposits are up $35 million. This is the dawn of new opportunities for non-bank financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not just the non-bank institutions which have welcomed the government's structural reform proposals for the finance industry. The Commonwealth Bank's managing director, David Murray, said that his bank would compete enthusiastically and that there would be lower overall costs from new technology. The National Australia Bank's Mr Don Argus said, `The proposed rationalisation of the regulatory framework and the opening up of the banking sector to other organisations acknowledges the reality of the globalisation of Australia's financial sector.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Bob Joss of Westpac said, `The government has made a bold set of policy decisions which will drive the continued deregulation of the Australian financial system.' The ANZ's Tonya Hudson said, `The bottom line is we are happy with it.' Mark Addis from the Australian Bankers Association said, `Adop 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion of the Wallis recommendations represented a milestone in the deregulation of the financial services sector.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Investors Managers Association, the Investment Funds Association, and the Life Investment and Superannuation Association all welcomed the changes yesterday. They said, `We strongly support the government's response to the recommendations of the financial system inquiry.' National Mutual's Geoff Tomlinson said, `Consumers are the winners from the government's adoption of the central recommendation of the inquiry.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Permanent Building Society said, `The building society industry is very positive about the Treasurer's announcement.' The Credit Union Services Corporation said, `The Wallis reforms would remove the last remaining barriers to effective competition and directly benefit 3.5 million Australians who are members of credit unions. The federal Treasurer has opened the door to a major national economic reform, while preserving the integrity, security and fairness of the financial system.' Australia's largest non-bank home lender, Aussie Home Loans, welcomed the response and said that it pointed the way to greater competition and particularly welcomed the opening of the payment system to non-banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bold set of economic reforms which this government has announced. It has the potential to improve the Australian financial system for a long time in the future. It recognises globalisation and technological change. It enhances competition and efficiency. It gives better services to consumers. It has the potential to lower costs for those in rural and regional Australia. These are welcome reforms with immediate benefits.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

Instead of concerning himself with jobs, instead of giving union leadership on tax reform, instead of tackling the challenges of this nation as we go into the 21st century, what did Bill Kelty do? He reached back into the 1930s and the 1940s and he invoked the language of class warfare. This was a re&hyphen;run of the sonata and the symphony speech&mdash;and you know how successful that was, don't you, brothers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I just say to the leader of the ACTU, the Australian Labor Party and the entire Australian community that in relation to the waterfront my government will pursue the national interest; it will not pursue a sectoral interest. In relation to the waterfront my government will pursue higher productivity. In relation to the waterfront my government will represent the interests of Australian farmers who year after year in the past have seen their produce rotting on the wharfs of Australia because of the behaviour of some of the unions that Mr Kelty now says he will bring the nation to a standstill in order to defend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My government will promote the export industries of this country. My government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7676"> will defend the legitimate rights of the Australian business community to ensure that the wharfs of Australia have world's best practice instead of, in some areas, world's worst practice. We will not repeat the error of the former government. I note incidentally that the former government did not escape from the Secretary of the ACTU either. He singled out our mate over there from Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, Laurie Brereton, for a little bit of special treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government spent $400 million of Australian taxpayers' money in order to make the Australian waterfront a world class exercise. Instead of that it still lags far behind. It is still, for example, cheaper to ship from Los Angeles to Indonesia than it is to ship from Sydney to Indonesia. We still had train rates at 14.9 containers per hour in the March quarter of 1997. This is viewed against levels such as Osaka at 32, Singapore at 35 and Yokohama at 47.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian firearms reforms are some of the most significant reforms ever undertaken in Australia. Through the commitment of the government, the opposition, I might add, and, in particular, the leadership of the Prime Minister, we have as a nation instituted reforms which will benefit our society for generations to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On any objective analysis the campaign for buying back firearms has been a great success. First, we have in place in all states and territories uniform licensing and registration laws and laws regarding ownership and storage of firearms. Secondly, detailed research has shown that not only is there almost universal recognition of the new laws but also there is about 80 per cent support for the new 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7679"> laws and the compliance rate for the firearm owners so far is also at about the 80 per cent level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As of noon today, 517,766 firearms have been handed in under the buyback campaign&mdash;that is, 517,766 firearms which have been removed from the community. There are 27 days to go in the buyback. The 80 per cent support for the laws validates the Prime Minister's leadership in relation to these reforms. The compliance by the vast majority of firearm owners shows that decent minded and responsible firearm owners respect the leadership the Prime Minister has shown.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that has come out of question time is just how disturbing the Labor Party's attitude is on the decision the government has made. Let us leave aside their inaction&mdash;in fact, incompetence&mdash;and irresponsibility of 13 years of office and the way they kept deferring any decision invoking the word `nuclear'. They went absolutely berserk whenever that happened. What they do not seem to know is the essential need to provide radio pharmaceuticals for Australians. As I said, 260,000 Australians depend on the use of radio pharmaceuticals, half of which are life threatening. There are 340,000 nuclear procedures or doses every year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that five per cent of the total number of procedures must be, because of the extreme emergency, delivered within a couple of hours to the patient being referred or diagnosed. This equates at the moment to 13,000 patients who need radio pharmaceuticals treatment urgently because their lives are at risk. Worse still is the fact that a lot of children are at stake here, because one-third of nuclear medicine procedures at Westmead and Prince Henry hospitals are for children. Some 3,800 reactor based scans for children were carried out at Westmead alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a case study, amongst others, put to me of neuroblastoma, which is the most common form of cancer in children. That child was recently treated at Westmead.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for LaTrobe for his question. Clearly, the government will not be moving to implement this proposal. In fact, in the Workplace Relations Act we introduced a series of measures to prevent this very sort of thing happening. For example, the commission has a new power under section 127 to require people to go back to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We introduced a new power in the commission to terminate or suspend a bargaining period where it was clear that, as a result of an industry wide approach, a union or an employer was unable to negotiate terms and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conditions specific to an enterprise. We introduced section 170MM which provides that, in the case of union agreements, industrial action is not protected if it is taken in concert with persons other than the union or its members employed by the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We brought back the new secondary boycott provisions, again because we want a system where the wage increase you have is made possible by the changes in your individual workplace giving business the ability to afford those very wage increases. That is a pretty sensible idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have a wage increase being required upon a business which cannot afford that wage increase, what will happen? Clearly, the business is likely to go out of business and, furthermore, the people working in that business are obviously going to lose their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen a development over the last few months of the policy of the Labor Party and the ACTU moving away from that which they advocated when they were in office. They have said, for example, that they will remove the allowable matters list&mdash;in other words, broaden the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission. They have said that they will widen union rights of entry&mdash;in other words, allow unions into workplaces where there are no union members. They have said that they will abolish the Office of the Employment Advocate, and they will obviously get rid of individual contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might ask what the implication is of having a policy where your wage increase is determined upon the efficiency and the productivity changes in that business. What better authority to quote than the Labor Party when they were in office? In October 1995 they released a document which they described as `the achievements of the Labor government', Shaping the Nation, in which they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the introduction of the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993, workplace bargaining has spread rapidly and is producing dramatic gains in productivity and better paid and more secure jobs for workers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, they are on the public record saying that if you want more jobs and more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7682"> pay you need a system of enterprise bargaining. They said that their legislation in 1993 `entrenches workplace bargaining as the centrepiece of Australia's industrial relations system'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, out of their own very public statements you have the argument for an enterprise bargaining system because it means more jobs and higher pay. That is what the government is doing. Now we have the extraordinary hypocrisy of these people. However inadequate might have been their implementation of such an idea, for years they advocated that if people are to have higher standards of living then you have to go to enterprise bargaining. Now, in concert with the ACTU&mdash;basically, dictated to by the ACTU&mdash;the ALP are abandoning that which they said would be good for workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If ever such a policy were introduced, the clear implications of it are that, as you yourselves have basically said, there will be fewer jobs and lower living standards, and people will not get the pay increases they deserve. Sadly, it is yet another example of `Now you are in favour of it; now you are against it', as with privatisation. With tariffs, you were great tariff cutters; now you are against it.

It is one of the things on which we have reflected in my office and come to the conclusion that you would not. And why have we come to that conclusion? It was your failure to get Australia into ASEM at the beginning, your negligence on this issue, which has led us to have to take up the task since the last election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to families. The trauma of family breakdown has far&hyphen;reaching social and economic effects for families and children. We have assisted in the avoidance of breakdown by providing additional funding for marriage and relationship education services. That was announced earlier this year. The government is also committed to helping families work their way through relationship difficulties with as much dignity and fairness as possible. No&hyphen;one wants families to end up in court. Where possible, families breaking up should be given the opportunity to reach agreed solutions without having a judge impose them upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, there was tabled in the House, and I released, a discussion paper suggesting possible ways to improve the delivery of mediation and counselling services to families. At present, such services are located in both the Family Court and organisations within the community sector. But in the past there has not been any overall planning or any real consideration of whether families are best served by locating such services in a court environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes it is time to examine whether greater community focus may assist more people to resolve their problems without resorting to legal proceedings. A possible outcome may be that counselling and mediation services are provided to a greater extent in a community setting rather 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7685"> than on court premises. I want to emphasise that at this stage no decision has been taken on what is the best mix of court and community sector services. Any such decision will be taken with full consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many issues are outlined in the discussion paper, which we expect to have wide circulation. Any changes that result will be subject to an ongoing consultation process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last 20 years, Australia has developed an increasing awareness that as a nation we have to find an appropriate balance between giving protection to Australia's sensitive environmental reserves and, at the same time, protecting jobs. This was a dilemma which confronted Labor in government. Anyone who remembers the times in which this issue came to the fore and the conflict that it engendered would recall the need for us to develop a process that was far better than the ad hoc 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> processes that we inherited when we first came into government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did establish a better process. That better process was the regional forest agreement strategy which was based around the premise that we would seek to achieve key objectives: to secure better environmental results and, at the same time, achieve better employment in the forest industries based on long&hyphen;term confidence and a proactive forest industry strategy. Arising from this, we developed with each of the states except Western Australia&mdash;which later signed an agreement with the incoming government&mdash;scoping agreements which set benchmarks for the way in which assessments would take place. They were to be transparent. They were supposed to develop long&hyphen;term confidence. They were supposed to ensure that proper and adequate reserves for environmental needs were put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were to be based on scientific criteria and the importance of that was underlined in the scoping agreements by the benchmarks under the JANIS criteria of 15 per cent pre-1750 forest types, 60 per cent of old growth, 90 per cent at least of wilderness and all rare and endangered species. Those were the environmental keys that needed to be secured for a RFA to be successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, on the other side, there was also an obligation to support employment in forest industries, to secure a long&hyphen;term strategy that would ensure that the forest industries would be sustained and that we would not continue to export jobs overseas as whole logs or woodchip, that we would move toward a downstream processing stream and establish a strategy which would commit us to a way in which we could go forward building value in what we were doing with our forest based industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening in Tasmania is a microcosm of what could happen to bring undone this very important process. I notice the Premier of Tasmania here in this House today. His mission is to speak to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the issue of TCF industries and to make representations about employment in Tasmania, particularly Blundstones and a number of industries which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7687"> are under threat. Tomorrow he speaks to the Prime Minister about a funding package for the RFAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premier illustrates the paucity of understanding of the importance of this issue to the government by indicating publicly yesterday&mdash;yet another Premier of a state&mdash;that this government is neglecting the state's interests by saying that the offer that has been made by the Commonwealth to date is less than half of the money that is required to underpin an adequate regional forest agreement for Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the Tasmanian RFA has attracted national attention and has been the focus of debate and discussion about the resolution of jobs and the environment for a decade, the eyes of Australia are upon us. If the Commonwealth does walk away from a properly funded, transparent and scientifically based outcome, it will mean that conservationists and industry representatives right around Australia will be questioning: why should we stay in this process if we are going to be stitched up at the last minute by a politically inspired fix?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premier has indicated that the Commonwealth has offered less than half the sum required for a satisfactory Tasmanian RFA. Why does this matter? It matters because you cannot construct a satisfactory regional forest agreement in Tasmania without an adequate funding base. Why can't you do that? Firstly, the JANIS criteria will necessarily mean further reservation of forest areas on public land from industry resource availability. So, at the very least, a significant sum of money will be needed to apply to the management of those new reserves, and also transitional arrangements and&mdash;sometimes I think you have to face it&mdash;redundancy arrangements for those who are going to be affected. That is the starting point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, in Tasmania we have a unique circumstance because of the great diversity of pre&hyphen;1750 forest types. It means you cannot get near an adequate JANIS criteria outcome without a proper management strategy to protect those forest types on private land. The Commonwealth has not yet accepted any responsibility for funding a management 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> strategy and, if necessary, an acquisition strategy for those forests whose preservation is still required to get a satisfactory environmental outcome on private land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Put those two things together&mdash;the initial costs of some additional reservations management and the transitional costs of private land management&mdash;and the ballpark figure is $100 million. Fine, you might say; that gets you a conservation outcome. But what about the other leg of the industry strategy? What about the other idea&mdash;that we are actually trying to secure long&hyphen;term employment and jobs for forest industries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently we understand that the Commonwealth is pressing for outcomes which are on the more significant side, environmentally, of the various options which have been canvassed on the draft RFAs. If the numbers go beyond four or five per cent of additional resource being taken away from the industry in Tasmania, then you will basically have to undertake a massive restructuring of the industry on the ground. You cannot just continue business as usual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It basically means we will have a lunar landscape on the employment front unless, as well as that, the Commonwealth provides an industry funding package. That industry funding package again is in the ballpark region of about $50 million to $100 million. These are figures which I have discussed with industry representatives and environmental representatives. I am certain that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) will not acquiesce to the exact figures, but I am certain they are not too far out of the ballpark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth is way under that. It is not committing a cent towards private forest management, without which the burden will shift onto the Tasmanian community, and it has got no dollars on the front for an industry strategy. So we continue to go down the track of exporting jobs, exporting whole logs, exporting woodchips, without a downstream  processing strategy built in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nationally, we need that. We have been dudded time and time again. When we highlighted what was happening and called in the Senate for the reimposition of controls on the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7688"> export of whole logs and woodchips, the government said, `Don't you worry about that, we are actually committed to an industry strategy.' It said that it would establish that strategy no later than July. Months afterwards, the long promised wood and paper industry council has still not been set up. Not a single dollar has been put forward on the industry side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also concerned because I hear rumours that the environmental issue is going to be seduced by bad politics. There is pressure to get good environmental outcomes, but we have had reports that the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, is actually proposing a crude swap to accommodate protection of some additional old&hyphen;growth forests, but at the expense of areas which are required to be preserved under the scientifically neutral JANIS criteria. In other words, you do a deal, you pretend you are doing something that is environmentally credible, but when you look behind you see the magic trick. You lose those reservations of pre&hyphen;1750 forest types, the rare and endangered species, and there are other crucial issues that need to be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not say that there is not division in the federal government now on this issue. They know how slimy this is seeming, without the willingness to put money in.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, Warwick Smith, has approached key industry leaders and said to them, `What would your attitude be if we delayed signing the RFA until after the next Tasmanian state election?' Why do you think that might be? With $100 million worth of projects held up because the RFA has not been signed&mdash;and it was due for signature two months ago, on 30 June&mdash;with all those dollars tied up, we have Warwick Smith, the minister who represents the Minister for the Environment in this House, slinking around 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the back door talking to key industry leaders and saying, `What would your attitude be to holding this whole thing up until after the next state election?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think he got the response he deserved, and I think Premier Rundle ought to get the response he deserves. He ought to be told by the Prime Minister, `These are legitimate requests you are putting forward on behalf of the Tasmanian community. You are not making ambit claims. You are actually speaking out for a Tasmanian community that has been clipped around the ears time after time&mdash;that is facing tariff decisions, that is facing costs that have been imposed by the withdrawal of Commonwealth funding of a massive dimension. The Premier should be saying to the Prime Minister, `We are on the bones of our arse in Tasmania.' Premier Rundle has come up here directly as a response to your contemptuous response the other day when you said that you had made a generous offer to Tasmania. He heard that. A generous response indeed! It is less than half the money that is needed to accommodate anything that approaches an outcome that is acceptable to Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a situation which is looming as a significant test of the federal government's commitment to the RFA process. If this process falls apart in Tasmania, we know it will not work anywhere else in Australia. If it does not work anywhere else in Australia, then it means we are back to the battlefields in the forests. It means that the issues will be resolved by sleight of hand in the backrooms through political deals. It means we are not capable of managing a scientific and neutral process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, the Australian Labor Party, stand for that process. We created it. It is the child of our experience, which we learnt over a long and difficult period of time. We are committed to a successful outcome. We will do nothing to undermine it. I speak strongly on behalf of all my Tasmanian colleagues when I say that what we want is a successful conclusion to the RFA which protects both jobs and the environment. That is what it was set up to achieve. That is the outcome we want. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7689">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only people standing in the way of that outcome are the federal government. They are mean spirited and not committed to the necessary elements to make the process work in our state.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we believe this is a benchmark of your good faith not only to the Tasmanian community but to the forest industries right around this country and to the conservation movement that reposed some confidence in you&mdash;completely wrongly&mdash;at the last federal election. They were dudded. They were dudded on Kakadu. They were dudded on commitments of funding for this weakened package that you have put together. They were dudded time and time again. Now we see this walking away from the scientific process and a failure to fund something which, after all, is going to be a benchmark of whether you succeed or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy sitting in that seat and, when you stand up, I want to hear whether you have an offer on the table that remotely comes near the $200 million that has been requested of you. I want to hear the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who is sitting over there, deny that he has put his resignation on the table. I want to hear why the minister who represents the Minister for the Environment in this place, the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), has sleazed around the industry saying that this whole thing should be put off until the political dynamics of the next Tasmanian election are out of the way.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say at the outset that I am not any more illuminated or aware in my mind as to precisely what this MPI is about than I was when we began. I am not sure whether the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) wants more money or a better environmental outcome&mdash;whatever `better' might be in his language&mdash;or a better industry outcome or whether he simply wants to come in here and try to stir a pot, which is one that I would have thought anyone on his side of politics 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would have been extremely keen to stay a long way away from, given their record on forest policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one reads carefully the wording of the matter of public importance before us today, one will see that it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the government to protect the environment while developing a coherent employment and industry strategy for Australia's forest industries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have to say that I really do not think what was said by the member for Denison matches accurately what he plainly believes is the case in the wording of that MPI, because it actually does acknowledge that we are `developing a coherent employment and industry strategy for Australia's forest industries'. That is what it says. It says we are `developing a coherent employment and industry strategy for Australia's forest industries'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thank you very much. You are right. That is in contrast to the performance that you put up in forest mismanagement during the 13 years of the Labor government. During that time we reached the absurd point in this country where, in direct contrast with every other major primary industry we have in the place, instead of exporting 60, 70, 80 or 90 per cent of our surplus, we are importing some $3 billion worth of our needs in timber and paper product. That is the result of Labor's forest and paper industry strategies and policies&mdash;if they can be called such. So thank you for the acknowledgment that yes, we are `developing a coherent employment and industry strategy for Australia's forest industries'. I am interested that you really do not want that matter pursued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be keen, of course, to deny the other part of your proposition, which is that, although we are developing a coherent employment and industry strategy for Australia's forest industries, according to you, we are failing to protect the environment, because I do not accept that for a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will come to some of your claims. I think a reasonably intelligent person who is listening might inappropriately draw the conclusion from what you were saying that you were advancing the proposition, firstly, that you were responsible for RFAs and that you were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7690"> implementing them. That is not correct, and I will trace through that in a moment. You had years and years to get your act together and do something, and you failed abysmally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, although we have in fact established our credentials, we have the first RFA up. We had it up within a matter of months. After your constant stalling, constant trouble making and constant turmoil, we have a track record well in the process of being established. The first regional forest agreement&mdash;East Gippsland&mdash;is up under the coalition government. The fact that some people might have missed it is testimony to how well and how competently we handled it. It is in direct contrast to the sort of mess that we saw whenever you tackled the forest industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, the other point I want to make in relation to Tasmania is that the RFA is in fact not completed. It is still being negotiated. So for you to assume or attempt to presume or to pretend that you actually know what is happening or what the basis for that RFA is&mdash;presumably, on the basis that you claim, all sorts of people have been telling you all sorts of things that I am sure they would not have been telling you&mdash;is wrong and inappropriate and does not add up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government are delivering on forests. We are delivering on forests and delivering results that the previous government was utterly unable to match. We are implementing the regional forest agreement process, not talking about it. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have the beginnings of the track record well and truly established&mdash;the foundation point from which we move on&mdash;and that is the successful completion of the regional forest agreement in East Gippsland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are in the final stages of negotiation of the Tasmanian RFA, and work is well and truly in progress for regional forest agreements in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. We have been prepared to put our money where our mouth is: some $48 million of funding to boost regional forest agreement processes, to get them under way. I can say, too, that we have delivered on achieving national consensus for reserve criteria. Again, that is something that the ALP proved utterly unable to do in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government. They procrastinated for three years. They put it in the too&hyphen;hard basket while it all fell to pieces around their ears.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that in the end you tried a very, very heavy-handed approach with the states, and the states might remember that. They might remember the pressure that they were put under. They might remember the sorts of licensing requirements that they were expected to wear when those opposite attempt to offer them some succour and some encouraging words about how wonderful their forest policy might have been in the past or how constructive it might be in the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that the member for Braddon will have some interesting things to say about that form when he takes my place at this box in a few minutes. The fact is that we undid some of your heavy-handed work&mdash;some of that work that went so far to break down trust, some of that paternalistic, authoritarian, patronising attitude that filtered through with your relationships with the states that were so reflective of the way in which you approached so many issues when you were in government. We undid a lot of that and put in place a regime which, amongst other things, developed the goodwill which is driving the process forward in so much more of a constructive way now than we saw under you. We put in place a rational export licence regime for woodchips which removed uncertainty for industry and the associated threat to forest industry employment and investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am absolutely intrigued that, after years of doing nothing to support forest industry investment and employment, suddenly the crocodile tears are out and we are told that it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7691"> matters, that they actually care about it. That they do not care about it is reflected in the fact that they do not have any rural and regional members to speak of on that side of the House. There was an election in March last year, and the people in rural and regional Australia&mdash;particularly those touched by the hopeless approach to the forest policy under the previous government&mdash;did not want to know about them any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have managed to revise the export regime for woodchips in a way that has ensured that environmental values are protected. This is reflective of our desire to see rational, sensible and robust regional forest agreements, and these will ensure&mdash;as in East Gippsland&mdash;conservation objectives and industry objectives are achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the RFAs, we will deliver conservation security and resource certainty, and that will provide a lasting basis for employment growth and industry investment. We are already starting to see that in East Gippsland. If you take the politics out and put sound policy in, decent results start to flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot help it but I want to come back to the ALP's record for just a moment. When I discovered that this MPI was being pulled I thought I should go back and have a quick look at their record. The national forest policy statement was signed in 1992. What happened for the rest of 1992 and 1993? Nothing.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was no progress made at all. In 1993&mdash;nothing. In 1994&mdash;nothing but chaos. At the end of 1994 and early 1995, their chickens came home to roost. I am very surprised that the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) is here because I thought these would be rather painful memories for him. We saw an absolute outbreak in the papers. The headlines said `Fresh talks as woodchip row gets nastier and out of control' and `Loggers take swing at PM'. It is all right, Mr Howard. If you are watching on your television, that was the previous Prime Minister. They are not going to go for you. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  at that time had the headline `Loggers set up Parliament blockade'. Other papers said `Day the loggers besieged Parliament', `Chips on shoulders, loggers lay

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we remember that, out of all of this in 1995, there was nothing but insecurity for industry and conservation. It got to the point where we had Faulkner saying one thing, we had Beddall saying another, then we had Collins dragged into  the whole ugly mess, and then the Minister for Resources basically vacated the scene. We could not work out what he was doing with all those trips overseas, but we recognised that he was trying to make amends. He was flogging woodchips, we think, one at a time.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, the industry strategy! Thank you very much. I really wanted to say something about the industry strategy. We are hearing a lot about our alleged failure to introduce a forest industry strategy. It is simply not true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get to the source of this rhetoric. The member for Denison knows what the source of that rhetoric is: it is the forest workers union. That is where that is coming from. The union is intensely embarrassed, perhaps even guilty, that it finds itself supporting not Labor but the coalition. That is where the forest workers union is putting its support. With us. Because we have a superior forest policy. We have got the runs on the board. There is no discredit in forest workers admitting federal Labor abandoned them long ago. It is true. Why should they be ashamed of that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I want to say this. The government does have an industry strategy, and the wood and paper industry strategy&mdash;despite what we have just heard here&mdash;has been largely implemented. It contained a whole range of initiatives: $2&half; million for research and development, delivered; $17 million for driving the development of farm forestry, delivered; lifting controls over exports of plantation grown wood, delivered in several states already; the national plantations inventory, completed; and sustainability criteria and indicators, being developed for each RFA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have not yet finalised is the Wood and Paper Industry Group&mdash;WAPIG&mdash;but it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7692"> is close. The terms of reference have been established. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has written to a number of key people inviting them to join WAPIG. But the name of the game is RFAs. That is what it is about. Resource certainty will be delivered by the RFAs which, belatedly, this Tasmanian representative now pronounces are what really matters.</PARA>

The member for Denison implied that there is infighting between Commonwealth ministers on the Tasmanian RFAs. That is called projection: he is wishing on us failings that they so identify amongst their own ranks. Think of those names I mentioned a moment ago: Beddall, Faulkner, Bob Collins and then, when he got in the swim, the previous Prime Minister. Then you are talking about infighting over forestry; then you are really seeing what infighting over forestry is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member needs to know that the Commonwealth has an agreed, united negotiating position for the Tasmanian RFA.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a glib ministerial response from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). This is ridiculous. Tasmanians have had enough of this vacillating by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his relevant ministers&mdash;Senator Hill and Minister Anderson&mdash;over the whole RFA process. Tasmanians want this issue resolved right now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania has always been everyone's whipping boy across a whole range of industry issues. With 460,000 people and only five federal seats, we are perceived as being irrelevant and electorally dispensable. Despite what the minster has alleged, my colleague 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7693"> the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has eloquently put forward reasons why this is a real matter of public importance, especially for Tasmanians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole complex issue of forests&mdash;their usage by the timber industry, the preservation of rare and endangered species, the conservation and management of wilderness areas, and the issue of old&hyphen;growth forest&mdash;has to be finally resolved. For too long, governments of all persuasions have pussyfooted around this sensitive and complex issue trying so unsuccessfully to placate both green and industry concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The RFA process was the only way to resolve once and for all this sensitive issue, to put some certainty back into the equation and to allow progress to take place&mdash;progress in establishing viable forest industries, progress in promoting more jobs in the forest industry, progress in establishing species reserves in perpetuity for future Australians and progress to stop the exporting offshore of jobs in the timber industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The RFA process is the best and the only sensible way to resolve this complex issue, providing better outcomes for the environment and better outcomes for the forest industry. The process is based on science&mdash;assessment of the various forest types against the JANIS criteria. It is a transparent process which allows those participating in the process to be confident that the outcomes are properly achieved. Tasmania, however, is a classic example of how such a seemingly simple process can go so horribly wrong and leap right off the rails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All players in the process saw 30 June 1997 as the final sign&hyphen;off date for the RFA process in Tasmania. The great expectation was that finally we were going to resolve this complex, sensible issue which has been a navel-gazing exercise for Tasmania for too long and has almost cleft asunder communities throughout Tasmania. We are now in the first week of September and no-one&mdash;I stress `no-one'&mdash;can say with any certainty when the signing&hyphen;off will take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole issue is like the gestation of a baby elephant: it just keeps going on and on. The failure to finalise this RFA process is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> causing unbelievable angst and anger right throughout Tasmania and is holding up in excess of $100 million worth of forest industry projects right now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the Tasmanian Premier in the gallery, it is sad for me to say&mdash;and I do this in a bipartisan way&mdash;that Tasmania is close to becoming an economic basket case. It has the nation's highest unemployment rate, negative population growth, huge youth unemployment figures and little prospect of attracting new industries to the state with this whole uncertainty hanging over the place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One needs only to listen to Tasmanians talk about their home state. Never before&mdash;and I have been there since 1961&mdash;has there been so much negativity and hopelessness expressed by people from all walks of life. Tasmania is in a real meltdown mode.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tasmanian Premier, who is sitting in the gallery, has unsuccessfully fought for a long period of time to convince the Prime Minister that there is a simple and achievable solution to the whole stupid impasse. I am sure he has been listening intently to this debate. I think he has not really been convinced and reassured by what the minister has said in his 15 minutes at the dispatch box.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a real requirement by the federal government to open its purse strings and provide Tasmania with the necessary dollars to allow the process to be finalised once and for all. In meeting the RFA requirements, it becomes obvious that it is not just about drawing lines on maps to include and exclude forest types and species. There is a real human dimension to this process, which the people in power in Canberra seem to forget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inclusion of species in a reserve requires a management regime to be put in place, as the honourable member for Denison said, and this costs real dollars. People forced out of work as a result of this RFA process who are no longer employed in certain regions need money for transition and relocation to other jobs and other living centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a realisation that Tasmania, probably because of its island status, has so many and so varied a range of forest species that it means not all of them are located on public 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7694"> land. You cannot have a successful RFA outcome in Tasmania without acquiring large tracts of privately owned land. What landowners in their right minds would willingly forgo private property without realistic and adequate compensation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member for Denison said, if a successful RFA outcome means withdrawing four to five per cent of the forest resource from the timber industry then money for successful and constructive industry restructuring is urgently required. The federal government has a real obligation if the RFA is to be achieved and signed off, hopefully by the end of September 1997, to provide Tasmania with the necessary dollars. The RFA process will provide a win&hyphen;win solution for jobs and the environment. The Prime Minister, Senator Hill, and Minister Anderson, get your acts into gear and assist Tasmania&mdash;neglect our plight and you stand condemned.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very amused by the matter of public importance brought to us by the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) because it must be the first time I have heard him talk in this parliament about the forest industries. I want to quote the previous leader of the Labor Party in Tasmania. Mr Field said about the federal government in March 1995:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's mismanagement of the export woodchipping issue had shown it was complacent and arrogant.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Complacency and arrogance had crept into its actions and it was time it listened to the people's anger and frustration. The federal government had 12 months to learn the lesson of defeat.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What happened? The Labor Party was defeated within 12 months of those comments being made. That was what the former Premier, the Labor Party leader, in Tasmania said about the record of the previous federal Labor government with regard to the forest industries. He summed it up pretty well&mdash;their record with regard to forest industries in this country was one of being complacent and arrogant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Denison said that Tasmania or Australia was being dudded. I want to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> go back over their record. I know that the member for Denison does not want us to go back over the record. He says, `Don't go down memory lane. Get on with it.' Of course the Labor Party do not want the Australian people to hear what their record was in trying to find a balance between the environment and the forest industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to being dudded, I want to remind the Australian people of what they did in Tasmania with the Helsham report. Let us go back and look at the record of the Labor Party just prior to that. In 1983, Kerin asked for an EIS on woodchip exports. In 1985 the EIS was completed. On 6 June 1986 a memorandum was signed between Ray Groom from Tasmania and the then federal minister for resources, Mr Kerin. Within six months that memorandum was brushed aside by the Labor Party and totally forgotten. Because they wanted to bring politics into the whole situation the minister was instructed in late 1986 to have Mr Nix inquire into the Lemonthyme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They inquired into the Lemonthyme and got a report from Mr Helsham. I guess we ought to be reminded of what was said at the time by then Minister Richardson. He was reported on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Labor in Power</EMPHASIS> as saying, `I picked Helsham because the Greens wanted him and he got it wrong.' What did Mr Helsham say? Based on scientific evidence, he said that there ought to be around 7,500 hectares set aside for world heritage listing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did Richardson do? He just plucked a figure out of the air. With no scientific data, no scientific information, no research he said, `Okay, 340,000 hectares. No, 7,500 hectares is no good.' He had a hand&hyphen;picked committee do all the work on it and he then said, `Sorry, that is not good enough.' That is the record of the Labor Party in power with regard to Tasmania. So they then implemented that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In December 1986, without discussing anything about Helsham with Tasmania, Hawke put out a press release announcing that there would be another major inquiry into world heritage values. By March 1987 what did we find? Minister Cohen had gone and Minister Richardson was in place for the 1987 election. What we found was total hypocrisy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7695"> on the part of the Labor Party with regard to forest industries and trying to balance them with the environment in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Would the Labor Party consider it on a scientific basis? No way, not the Labor Party. The Labor Party secretaries in Sydney had had a meeting and they told the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Hawke, that he had better do something about it and make sure he captured the Green vote. For the member for the Denison to come in here and cry crocodile tears about the forest industries in Tasmania is absolutely farcical. As I have said before, certainly not before they were thrown out of government did he talk about or give support to the forest industries in Tasmania. I have strongly supported the forest industries since I came here in 1984 and I continue to do it. No doubt the government outcome will create stability and security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk about Wesley Vale for a few moments. That is a $1.2 billion project. You are talking about a $100 million project. What did you do? Richardson flew down and talked with the dark greens and scotched the whole deal. That is the Labor Party's record in regard to forest industries in this country. They were not concerned about a balance between the environment and the forest industries. They were not concerned about the workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other one was in 1992, when we had the pulp mill industrial dispute up in Burnie. We have the Labor Party here saying they really support the workers. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who was then President of the ACTU, came down there. He backed the workers. There were 1,323 working in that mill at that stage. Guess how many there are there today? Less than 500. All under the Labor Party policy. They really do back the workers!

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995 we had a series of debates in here with regard to forest industry. You could call it the coupes or the debacle in forest industries, and I want to say a little bit about that because it really was a bit of a joke. This is towards the end of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995 they had a debate and they were trying to get this right. They started to talk about the forestry coupes. First of all, we had the then Prime Minister come into the parliament and talk about 513 coupes. Then he came in the next day and he talked about 509 coupes. Then Minister Lee came and said he thought 17 coupes should come off that list. Then, of course, Senator Faulkner said, `No, I think we want 1,300 coupes.' But Mr Beddall said, `No, we will have 85.' Do you know, when we got down to 509 coupes and we looked at where some of these coupes were in regard to Tasmania, they were out in Bass Strait. That is how much scientific work the previous Labor government did in regard to trying to find a scientifically based outcome for forestry and the environment. It was absolutely ludicrous.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I feel compelled to speak in this debate because the hyperbole on both sides is absolutely, gut&hyphen;wrenchingly sickening. The truth is this: we are faced with a $3 billion deficit in timber products. We import into this nation $3 billion a year of wood products when we should be a net exporter. This is the result of the policies of both governments. Neither can escape the blame at all. It has not happened in the short term; it has happened over a considerable period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy goes on. In Western Australia, the Greens have got the balance of power in the upper house now. They have got that balance of power because they received preferences from the Liberal Party. That is why they have got control. Because they have got this balance of power you are going to see the incumbent Liberal government do all sorts of trades. I will project this: that the head of Dr Syd Shea, the Director of CALM, is on the block. The Greens want Syd Shea because he has been the one that has stood up to them, not just in Western Australia but across Australia. They want that and they will get that, I guess. They also want, of course, to split the Department of Conservation and Land Management back into two different departments, hoping that they can hijack the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environment as the environment was hijacked in this place by the Greens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But who are the Greens? Let us analyse who they are. Basically, there are three people who vote Green. There is a protest voter. In my electorate most of them now vote for me. There is that great mass in the middle: largely uninformed, largely on government salaries, and they are the people who think trees are people too. Then there are the people who run the Greens. That is where the communists went when you had the breakdown of the eastern European economic model.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will all recall that when the eastern European model failed the Communist Party disappeared in Australia. The people did not disappear. They went to the Green movement, to the Aboriginal industry, to the feminists, to the homosexual lobbies, and they brought with them the Marxist doctrine of incrementalism. You have all seen that: `All we are asking for is just a little bit here; just give us a little bit of old&hyphen;growth forest, that is all we want.' The public says, `Let's shut them up, okay.' They acquiesce and the response is immediate: `Thank you very much, now all we want is this.' The policy of incrementalism: straight out of Trotsky. That is what we have been subjected to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have got to look at the performance of the previous government, a government that was supposed to look after workers. Coronation Hill: it was illegal when Hawke did it. It might have taken some time, but the High Court eventually ruled that way. As the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) said in respect to Wesley Vale, that was not a great success for the previous government&mdash;workers jobs were sacrificed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem you have is this: Tasmania is in a diabolical situation. It is dying on its feet. But it is not dying through natural causes. Tasmania is being murdered by the policies of this government and the previous government. Until there is a recognition of the need for a manufacturing industry in this country&mdash;and I suggest that the timber industry and downstream processing are a vital part of that manufacturing industry&mdash;you will see Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia die. It will be hidden for a time in Victoria, where 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7697"> there is the casino&hyphen;led recovery. But I can assure you that will come to a very sudden end very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this House this present government talk about providing $100 million for a railway in the Northern Territory&mdash;a railway they know has no economic foundation at all. There is no basis for it whatsoever. If the $100 million is spent, that will be only a fraction of what will be required and that will leave the taxpayers of Australia with an ongoing burden. That is simply a stunt to win a state election in the Northern Territory and the coming election in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not one member from Tasmania got up in this House and said, `Fair go. Let's have some resources for Tasmania.' Tasmania is much more important than the Northern Territory to the welfare of this nation. Quite frankly, what we ought to do with the Northern Territory is get realistic and whack it up amongst the surrounding states. That is the best solution for the Northern Territory. It would solve quite a few problems and, believe me, it would be much more economical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In rising to speak, we are faced with a government that says it has an industry policy. But has it? This government embraces the Hilmer report&mdash;the creation of the previous government. The Hilmer report is high school economics&mdash;it is absolute nonsense. The talk about situations where natural monopolies occur and about competition is simply childish. Unfortunately, the government also embraces the Mortimer report. It cannot have it both ways. Those reports are mutually exclusive. The Mortimer report, I think, is a very flawed document but at least it is moving in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the Mortimer report says that the government should not pick winners, and then he proceeds to do so but of course picks all the wrong winners&mdash;like a national industry capacity in tool making. That used to exist, largely in Tasmania, but has now gone. This is something we desperately need for our national security. It is an industry of strategic importance to Australia. It has gone. We have seen under successive governments, the last one and this one, a deskilling of this nation; and it is not going to change with the present 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> attitude. Unless we get back to a reskilling of this nation, there is going to be no end to the problems we face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must pay tribute to the member for Franklin (Mr Quick). He got one thing right. When he said that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) was glib. He is absolutely right there. He is very glib and he is articulate. Unfortunately, he is also a fool, and there is no greater danger to a nation than a glib, articulate fool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is: this whole policy of economic rationalism is what is driving this debate. We have seen an industry crippled. The minister talks about assistance and what the Commonwealth government has done. I can tell you what the Commonwealth should do: it should butt right out. The best forest management techniques in Australia probably reside in Western Australia and Tasmania&mdash;they are both very good. But any state, even the worst state, has infinitely more capacity than the federal government in respect of forest management. This is clearly an issue that should be left to the states. It is not an issue for Commonwealth intervention at all. If it had been left to the states, we would not have that $3 billion deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a situation in Victoria where the Greens would not allow logs lying on the forest floor to be harvested, whether they were A, B, C or D grade logs. The good timber could have been taken off into flitch mills and the rest could have been pulped. Why didn't the Greens want that? Because the Greens knew that this gave the capacity to establish a pulp mill at Eden and they knew that, once a pulp mill was established, they would not be able to stop it. While the pulp mill had not been established they could continue to attack forest management. They knew that once the mill was established, once so many jobs were created, they would not be able to stop it. For years, particularly under the Kirner government, this was the situation. That was also the situation under the previous government and no action was taken to stop it. If you returned the control of forests to the states, you would see better forest management outcomes in this country and you would see much better forest management.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7698">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I attended a lecture today by Professor Castles. He said that it surprised him, but it was fairly obvious from his research, that governments that had centralised fiscal policies had much worse economic outcomes than those that did not. There is no more centralised economy in the world than Australia, although I think he ranks us third in the world. It is certainly a very highly centralised economy in terms of the power of the federal government, and the stupidity of the High Court has compounded that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message is clear: you get much better economic outcomes with decentralisation. The problem is: I do not know of any political party in this nation that is going to sacrifice the power it wants for itself in the national interest. It would probably be an illusion to think that would happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I serve warning on this House. I, through Australia First, will be contesting every Senate seat in the next election, will be contesting lower house seats across Australia and will be contesting state elections. I believe that we could have the balance of power. When we have the balance of power and drive out the Democrats, who are the left wing of the Labor Party, and the Greens, or the Communist Party, we might start to get some sensible policy direction in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to resume the debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R256">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 [No. 2]</XREF>  after we were interrupted by question time. The reason the government is making this decision is that it was recommended to us by the industry to remove the tariff. If the Queensland industry, which represents 95 per cent of sugar production, said otherwise, then I would be quite happy the comply with that. But that was a decision that they made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people have asked, `Why aren't you crossing the floor?' I am not crossing the floor on this issue because I do not want to jeopardise the very package that we fought hard to achieve in New South Wales. To reiterate the point to this parliament, that package involves additional money which will go to infrastructure which will assist the New South Wales industry to get back in the export market where, to date, they have been principally capturing the refined sugar market in Australia and to likewise gain access to the lucrative US quota market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is symbolism for those that do cross the floor today&mdash;the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) is one&mdash;and I respect their wish to do that. In many ways, the member for Kennedy has a legitimate grievance because the abolition of the pooling system will have a significant impact on his area. From the evidence I have presented today, even if a tariff was put back in place, it would have no impact on the domestic price of sugar because the pricing formula has been changed by the Queensland Sugar Corporation from import parity to export parity. Likewise, the tariff issue is very different to the automotive industry because the sugar industry were unanimous in their recommendation to remove it. Indeed, if they did feel passionately about it, they could have put in a dissenting report. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7699">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is interesting in this whole debate is the hypocrisy of the opposition in arguing this case. They were the ones that initiated the very inquiry which recommended it. They were the ones that appointed the panel which was made up of the Queensland government at the time, which was ALP, and by the federal government at the time, which was also ALP. They obviously have been very opportunistic. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> said it is `contemptuous opportunism of the Labor opposition'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have been contemptuous of rural Australia for quite some time. Indeed, when you look back at the history of rural Australia and the added concentration of foreign ownership, it was principally because they modified the foreign ownership rules. Examples are the added concentration in the meat industry and the takeover of vertical integration by foreign companies not just in sugar but in many other sectors. They have failed also to implement anti-dumping measures. That is what this government will attempt to do to act as a legitimate barrier to foreign imports coming into this country, which is absolutely essential. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to take part in the debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 [No. 2] and to make some comments in respect of the proposal by the government to abolish the sugar tariff. The member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), who has just concluded his remarks, posed a question to himself as to why he was not crossing the floor on this issue. The reason he is not crossing the floor on this issue is that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) told him not to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He made a very technical speech which avoided the two central features of the government's abolition of the sugar tariff. The first one is the black hole which was the promise they all made. The second one is the assertion, which I will forensically disprove, that the industry generally is in favour of this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the starting point for this debate? The starting point for this debate is the commitment that the government made to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people of Australia and to the cane growers and sugar growers of New South Wales and Queensland in the run&hyphen;up to the last election. That is found in the paper released on Monday, 5 February 1996 by the National Party Deputy Leader and the then shadow minister for primary industries, Mr John Anderson, MP, now the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. It is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reviving the heartland: building a sustainable future for Australia's primary industries</EMPHASIS>. In that document we find the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal and National Parties wish to create an economic environment in which the sugar industry continues to expand, and point out that the Commonwealth has no legislative control over the industry other than in the area of tariff protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal and National Parties recognise the industry's tariff protection has been significantly reduced over the years to its current level of $55 a tonne as Australia has set the trend by moving protection downwards in advance of international competitors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The paper goes on to say in bold, which reflects a specific commitment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Liberal&hyphen;National Government will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55/ tonne as we have already met our obligations under the World Trade Organisation (GATT `94) agreements;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">recognise and uphold the Queensland Government's responsibility for administering the single desk export arrangements in that State;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">maintain the Commonwealth sugar infrastructure development program.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is an express and specific commitment given by the coalition in the run&hyphen;up to the last election not to reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level. Why? Because Australia had already met its current GATT obligation or WTO obligation of $55 a tonne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the express and unequivocal commitment which the coalition went to the last election with. That was an express and personal commitment which each and every member in the various sugar seats gave to their constituents and to the various cane and sugar growers in the course of their election campaigns. It was personally given by the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), it was personally given by the member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly), it was personally given 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7700"> by the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), it was personally given by the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), it was personally given by the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), it was personally given by the member for Page (Mr Causley), and it was personally given by the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), and he just told us that he is proposing to break it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has become clear over the weeks and months that, at this stage, the only person on whom we can rely to meet that commitment to the various electorates is the member for Kennedy, Mr Katter. It will be interesting to see whether the member for Dawson, Mrs De-Anne Kelly, can find some way of moving around that commitment when she makes her contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the points made by those members of the coalition who are proposing to break that personal undertaking to their constituents is that somehow the industry has been in favour of this breach of election commitment. Let me take the House briefly through some reports which have occurred following the government's announcement of its decision in March of this year to abolish the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 4 March, under an item entitled `Farmers Angered as Sugar Tariff Scrapped', AAP reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cane farmers in both Queensland and New South Wales criticised the decision while National Party backbenchers reversed their previously scathing stance on the tariff plan.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One should of course except the member for Kennedy. That report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Cane Farmers Association general manager John Allison said cane growers had been handed an ultimatum of choosing between tariffs and singledesk selling.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Allison was reported as going on to describe the decision as `unacceptable, undemocratic' and made `without discussion'. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a groundswell of opinion and overwhelming opposition to the recommendations to remove the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report also has Australian Sugar Millers Council general manager, John Desmarchelier, saying: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . large numbers of growers and millers would disagree with the decision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the same day, on 4 March, the transcript of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>  program records Mr Ian Ballantyne, the General Manager of Canegrowers Queensland, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If either side of government could have guaranteed our industry that the retention of the tariff would have also guaranteed retention of our other marketing and structural arrangements, then we would have probably had a different approach.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In very subtle words, he was saying what other people have said much more robustly&mdash;that a gun was held at the head of the cane growers to choose the single desk arrangements or the tariff but not both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 6 March, AAP records Australian cane farmers joining a `protest chorus'. The Australian Cane Farmers Association general manager is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cane farmers from Mossman in north Queensland to Maclean in New South Wales have been scathing in their assessment of the recommendations by the Sugar Industry Review Working Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a groundswell of opinion and overwhelming opposition to the recommendation to remove the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And he repeats his comments about the undemocratic and unacceptable manner in which the decision has been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an earlier report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> in February, `Sugar tariffs set for axe despite revolt', Canegrowers Queensland chairman, Harry Banano, is reported as saying that cane growers `had reluctantly accepted the tariff's demise as part of a compromise to retain the single desk selling arrangement.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only member of the government in this House who can hold his or her head up high at this stage is the member for Kennedy. The member for Kennedy has been crystal clear in his approach to this matter from day one. On 5 March on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program he is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a loss in Queensland to about $4,000 on average of every single producer in the State, every single cane farmer. In a downturn in the industry, the industry's reasonable prices at the present moment, in a cyclical downturn the situation will be very, very difficult. Mills will be put under threat, farms will be put under threat and we'll have the same sort of situation flowing across 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7701"> to the sugar industry that exists in the cattle and wool industries of Australia. And the export earnings that are coming from what is a very, very successful industry that is remaining internationally competitive, in spite of subsidies of 193 per cent, that they're performing in the marketplace against. . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reference to the 193 per cent of course is a reference to the European Union tariff in respect of sugar, which is at that level. Mr Katter is asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the point of threatening to cross the floor when the Cane Growers organisation seems to be quite happy with the situation?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Katter replies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Cane Growers organisation most certainly isn't. They were forced at (sic) a gun at their head. They were told, we'll deregulate and leave you at the mercy, the tender mercies, of the international processes and traders. Or, alternatively, you can agree to take the tariffs off'. They agreed with a gun at their head. That's absolute rubbish and it's a very scurrilous comment, if anyone says that the Cane Growers Association, or the Cane Farmers' Association, agreed to this. They most certainly did not and do not at this point of time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the honourable member for Kennedy in a crystal&hyphen;clear manner debunks, on the basis of best evidence, the notion that somehow mythically and mystically the cane growers and the sugar growers are in favour of the government breaking an express election commitment that was part of its primary industries platform at the last election and made individually and personally by the various members that I have named.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later that month Mr Katter, in an interview on Sydney Radio 2UE on 19 March with John Laws, is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John, I don't look for these things but, I mean, I find myself once again embroiled in conflict with the sugar industry. But, I mean, I gave a personal promise before the last election. I mean, I stood up and told the people of the electorate that I represent that I will not be voting for any tariff reduction in the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I made my position very clear in the Party room. But we also gave an election promise here, John, as well. I mean, the Government, or the now Government of Australia, before the election we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said on page 32 of our policy document, a Liberal/National Government will not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55.00 a tonne, as we have already met our obligations under the World Trade Organisation GATT `94 agreement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In that subsequent interview, the member for Kennedy makes the point that this was a personal undertaking given by him; it was a personal undertaking given by the various members that I have named. And he is the only one who is prepared to come into this House and say that he will do what he committed himself to do&mdash;namely, vote against the government's proposal, in breach of its express election commitments, to abolish the sugar tariff. That quote from the member for Kennedy stands in stark contrast to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), who on 11 June on the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>  program is asked by the reporter, in respect of the sugar tariff:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You obviously thought before the election that the tariffs were significantly important enough to guarantee that they remained in place?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In one of those massive understatements, the minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, we indicated that we were within what was required by WTO and those sorts of parameters and that we therefore saw no need to move.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He massively understates as best he can the express election commitment that the member for Kennedy has drawn so clearly to our attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who do we have left of the seven sugar seat holders, all of whom made express personal commitments to the community, to their electorates, to cane growers and sugar growers and to the Australian people at the last election? There is only one who we know at this point in the cycle will hold true to that commitment. We will hear shortly from the member for Dawson, but the member for Hinkler, the member for Leichhardt, the member for Herbert, the member for Richmond and the member for Page stand in stark contrast to the honourable way in which the member for Kennedy is proposing to conduct himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Richmond, when he concluded his remarks after being interrupted by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7702"> question time, made some comments about the Labor Party's position in this matter. Our position in respect of this matter in the run&hyphen;up to the last election was quite clear: yes, we had engaged in a process of reducing tariffs in the sugar industry, but the commitment that we took to the last election was to review the sugar tariff effective from July this year and we look at it in the context of the next agricultural round of the WTO. Our commitment was to review. We have done our review. We have come to the conclusion which could not be put better than the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) did in a question to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 5 March. The Leader of the Opposition said to the Prime Minister, by way of question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it not a fact that Australia's Uruguay Round obligation for sugar is a tariff of $70 per tonne by the year 2000? Is it not the case that the current tariff, abolished by the government yesterday at $55 per tonne&mdash;an effective 13 per cent&mdash;is comfortably within that obligation? Is it not the case that the sugar tariff on many of our export destinations is massively higher than that? For example, the US is at 100 per cent, Thailand is at 104 per cent and the European Union is at 170 per cent. How does the government's establishment of a zero sugar tariff for Australia stand with the Prime Minister's statement to the parliament last year that the government would take into account what other countries are doing or, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  puts it, `PM says we won't go it alone on tariff cuts'? Why has the government given our trading partners something for nothing on sugar?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the context in which the Labor Party stands so far as the sugar tariff is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to one of the industry leaders who said, `If a political party had said to us, "You can have the tariff and the single desk arrangements," we'd go for that.' That is our position: you can have the tariff and you can have the single selling desk arrangements. All the government had to do to effect that was to stick to the commitment that it expressly gave to cane growers in the course of the last election campaign.</PARA>

I reported my initial findings and advice back to the House last night just after 9.30.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received further advice today from the Commander, Northern Command, including a statutory declaration from his senior public relations officer. Following this advice, I am not satisfied that the original advice I was given last night is accurate, and therefore I have today asked the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Barrie, to look into the matter. In the process, I invite the member for Brisbane to provide any material which he might think is appropriate in this matter. I table the most recent reports from the Commander, Northern Command, including the statutory declaration that I am talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, and more importantly, I think probably inadvertently the member for Brisbane, while raising a bit of a political stunt, has raised the issue of the Privacy Act and whether or not rank details should be released when other details&mdash;name, address and so forth&mdash;are provided by a military authority or a military commander. I have asked Admiral Barrie whether he would look into this matter as to current practice, whether it happens on a weekly, daily or monthly basis and whether the Privacy Act is in fact operating against the good and sensible release of such rank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just give an example while I am on my feet: the roll of honour which was put out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 14 January after we rescued the various Frenchmen and the itinerant Englishmen who were 2,300 or 2,400 kilometres south of Perth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997. I advise the House that I am a cane grower, as everybody around the Mackay district is, and that should be taken into consideration in the comments that I make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will start by outlining the history of the sugar industry review working party recommendations, since that is central to the argument in the debate. There were 76 recommendations but only two of them are relevant to this debate. The first was that single desk selling and acquisition should be retained for the sugar industry. It is absolutely vital to have those regulatory arrangements retained, certainly for the Queensland sugar industry. Those who were involved in the sugar industry review quite rightly made a judgment that the single desk selling and acquisition arrangements should be kept and that there was perhaps some threat to them. They decided, for their own reasons, reluctantly to relinquish the tariff. It was a sound judgment in the best interests of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go back a little further in history and deal with what happened in 1989, because that is when the embargo on sugar being imported into Australia was lifted. And do you know who did that, Mr Deputy Speaker? It was the Labor Party. The National Party moved to introduce a tariff of $110 per tonne at that time, and it was successful. In 1991, the tariff of $110 per tonne was reduced to $76 per tonne. Again, who did that? The Labor Party did that. In 1992, the $76 per tonne tariff was reduced to $55 per tonne. Again, who did that? The Labor Party did it. While they stand over there and bleat about how sanctimonious they are, it is they, on every occasion, who have removed regulatory arrangements in the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us think for a moment about those tariff reductions. Have consumers benefited? That was the argument put by the Labor Party. Again, it was the Labor Party which put 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7704"> forward in the Hilmer competition policy that consumers would benefit. I would like to show you that consumers have not benefited at all from reductions in the tariff under the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1989, when the tariff was reduced from $110 per tonne, the price of chocolate across six states has increased on average by 52 per cent. What about soft drink and cordials? It is interesting, by the way, that you cannot get these figures from the Australasian Soft Drink Association; they will not let them out. The price increase for soft drink and cordials over that period has been 34.7 per cent. Over that period the CPI has risen by 29 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the tariff worth? It is rather difficult to estimate over that period because of varying prices, but it would be in the order of $142 million. That is the amount that has gone from farmers&mdash;to where? Quite plainly, it has not gone to consumers. It has gone into the pockets of multinational commercial users of sugar. That has occurred under the Labor Party's policy. That is where it has gone. There has been no benefit to consumers or to farmers. Yet the Labor Party stand here hypocritically and pretend that they are on the side of the farming sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister recently went to Mackay. Do you know what he said about the farming sector and the sugar industry? He said he was in Mackay for a free kick. He just wanted a free kick for the Labor Party. He wanted to find out what he could use in debate. He was not interested in the long&hyphen;term future of the industry. Plainly, with a history like that, how could you pretend to be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the member for Hotham (Mr Crean)? The member for Hotham was asked recently, on behalf of the farming sector, to assist. Of course, he knows what his response was. I do not think he is very popular at the moment. I will not go into that, but perhaps he would care to come into the House and tell people how he broke an agreement with the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The suggestion put forward by the sugar industry review working party was that the tariff be removed and that the regulatory arrangements be retained. Implicit in that was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a commitment from the coalition government that the same economic rationale would apply to all industries equally. If that had been the case, I think that would have been an equitable outcome. It would have been very hard to argue against the fair and equitable treatment of all industries with regard to the tariff. But, of course, as subsequent events have shown, that has not been the case. The car industry, which has a present tariff of 22.5 per cent, is to have a gradual reduction to 15 per cent by the year 2000. It will be held at that level until the year 2005, when the tariff will supposedly go to 10 per cent. We will see whether that happens. It seems likely that the textiles, clothing and footwear industries will receive similarly lenient treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does it cost the farming sector for those tariffs to be retained? An estimate from Access Economics is that, for those other tariffs that remain, every farmer pays $2,300 per year. But they have lost their tariff, so you are paying on the one hand but you are not being given relief on the other. That is a very inequitable arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commitment was not kept in other ways as well. On the sugar task force, which has yet to report&mdash;and I do not wish to pre&hyphen;empt their findings&mdash;the concern, certainly from cane growers in Queensland, is that New South Wales will be given access to Australia's US sugar quota. If that comes to fruition, the cost to a Queensland grower would be $300 per annum. The benefit to a New South Wales farmer would be $3,500 per annum. To a Queensland mill, the loss would be $25,000 per annum. The benefit to New South Wales mills&mdash;and I am very pleased that my New South Wales colleagues are here and, furthermore, that they are on the sugar task force; I hope that they will bear this in mind&mdash;will be $330,000 per annum. I do not recall that we had agreed in Queensland to give away part of our US sugar quota without a commensurate agreement from New South Wales that they would share in securing our single desk selling arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tariff has a limited use to the farming sector. Because of the move from import parity pricing to export parity pricing, the tariff now has one sole objective, that is, to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7705"> act as a disincentive to imported sugar coming into Australia&mdash;that would be imported, refined, subsidised sugar coming into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bearing in mind that the commercial users of sugar have already got the benefit of the tariff with this move from import parity pricing to export parity pricing, the money is in their pocket. Let us not forget that they are the beneficiaries, not the consumer&mdash;and certainly not the farming sector and my regional towns. So they have the money in the pocket. Why is it then that the Australasian Soft Drink Association are pushing so hard for the tariff to be removed? Why would they be asking for that if they already have the money?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Gentile, who was on the sugar industry review working party&mdash;a man, unfortunately, who, while he may have an argument, certainly has no manners&mdash;has referred to the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and myself as `sugar dogs'. When you have to resort to that language, quite plainly you do not have a very strong argument. And that is the case. Mr Gentile does not have a strong argument. He knows that it is his representatives, his clientele, who are the beneficiaries of the move to export parity pricing to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. Furthermore, he knows that he is not going to give a commitment to the Australian people that the benefit of removing the tariff will be passed on. They did not do it in the past and they are not going to do it again. So when you know that you are deceiving the Australian people, you resort to poor language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving back to the final role of the tariff as a disincentive to subsidised imported refined sugar coming into Australia, there is a very real threat of that, mainly because Australia is one of the few countries in the world that does not subsidise its farmers. Thailand, for instance, subsidises its farmers to a great extent. For the first five years of production, there is no tax. Imagine a tax holiday for five years. It would be pretty good&mdash;and it is in Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing is that the price is subsidised. When our Australian farmers are getting 10c per pound, Thai farmers are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> getting in the order of 23c per pound&mdash;nice if you can get it. That also means that they are in a very good position to export highly subsidised sugar into other markets. The United States likewise, because of their quota system, artificially raises the returns to their farmers. When our price is 10c per pound, theirs is in the order of 19c per pound&mdash;these are all in the same currency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would happen if we had subsidised imported refined sugar coming into Australia? Mr Gentile and the Australasian Soft Drink Association would not only be able to keep the money from the tariff in their pockets, not only continue to raise prices to the level that they have since 1989, but they would have cheap feed&hyphen;stock&mdash;really cheap feed&hyphen;stock, very cheap feed&hyphen;stock&mdash;which would further fatten their profits. But I bet you will not see the price of soft drink or chocolate go down. I bet families will not be able to buy sugar to put in their products at home any cheaper. Consumers will be no better off than they have been since 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will happen to jobs in the sugar towns&mdash;in Mackay, Ingham, Innisfail, Proserpine, Home Hill, Ayr, Tully and Cairns? I can tell you what will happen. Our jobs and investment in our industry will go overseas. It is a lose&hyphen;lose situation. While the opposition sits over here smugly saying, `Oh, my goodness, look at us; we've changed,' they were the hypocritical group which allowed this to happen since 1989. They have no credibility in this debate. The only party that has kept faith consistently with the farmers, particularly the cane farmers in this country, has been the National Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have one further difficulty. In our coalition policy prior to the last election it said that the coalition `would retain the tariff at $55 per tonne because it had complied with all Australian obligations as a signatory under the World Trade Organisation'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that there has been a recommendation from the leaders of industry and from the sugar industry review working party; however, bearing in mind that the commitments that were made to the farmers have not been kept in full, I find it very difficult to walk away from a commitment such as that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7706">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One further matter of concern in the farming sector is the future of single desk selling and acquisition. The matter of the tariff and whether it is to be retained or abolished will finally be decided in the Senate, but there is a concern that the federal government might revisit the review. If the government is unsuccessful it might be embittered enough to go back and break yet another deal with the cane farmers of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that that would not be the case. However, I did not just rely on the good intentions of government&mdash;either this one or the last one. In May, I wrote to the Premier of Queensland, Mr Rob Borbidge, and asked him what his reaction would be were the move to abolish the tariff lost in the Senate. Fortunately, Mr Borbidge is man who knows very clearly whom he represents and he also knows what a commitment is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Borbidge wrote back to me and told me that I could assure the cane growers of Australia&mdash;and particularly of Queensland, because it is Queensland state government legislation&mdash;that the regulatory arrangements in the sugar industry belong with the state. He told me that regulatory arrangements in the sugar industry, single desk selling and acquisition, were absolutely fundamental to the prosperous future of everybody who made their livelihood from the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Borbidge also said that there is absolutely no way that a Queensland National Party state government would consider changing those. He said that, if the federal government found difficulties in implementing all of the recommendations from the sugar industry review working party, that was a matter for the federal government, but Queensland would fulfil all of its commitments. I am very pleased to say that, regardless of the debate in this House and the Senate, the regulatory arrangements for the sugar industry are secure under a National Party state government. I totally support the Premier of Queensland in his stand, and I am pleased to see that he is going to keep his commitment to the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a great deal of hypocrisy in this debate. It is very easy, like a dingo, to run into a camp and then change your mind 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and run out again. It is very easy to be hypocritical when those on that side of politics have been responsible, since 1989, for reductions in all the regulations in the sugar industry. I do not think the hypocrisy on this side of the House will be lost on the farming sector, particularly the cane farming sector in Queensland. I am very pleased that the National Party always keeps faith with the farming sector.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia was once a proud, strong, manufacturing nation. In many ways we were independent and self&hyphen;reliant, a product perhaps of our relative isolation and need. The Second World War caused us, because of that isolation and the imminent threat of invasion, to industrialise on a scale not previously imagined for a country of our population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today Australians face a new threat: not so much invasion from outside but defeat from within. Australians face the threat of the policies of their own government, a government that for many years has worked against the interests of the majority of the population; a government seemingly prepared to scrap its own people for reasons that are unclear, though there are many theories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the reasons are decidedly unclear as to why so many destructive policies have been undertaken by government, the devastation that has resulted is obvious to all. In 1961, 27.5 per cent of Australians were employed in the manufacturing industry, yet today that figure is around 12 per cent and falling. In 1961, unemployment stood at 2.6 per cent but today, even though we are told that unemployment is 8.7 per cent, no&hyphen;one believes this and many suspect and believe that hundreds of thousands of unemployed people are simply hidden in various other programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the last 25 years, both Liberal and Labor have taken us down the path of free trade and globalisation. Though it sees countless Australian businesses and manufacturers disappearing or moving overseas to use the cheap work forces of foreign lands, though it sees farmers forced from their land and Australian companies no longer in Australian hands, though it sees untold numbers of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7707"> Australians losing not just their jobs but their hope, the government continues to relish its pursuit of an agenda which fails the people who elected it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of providing jobs or incentives to create employment, the government tries to make people feel better by providing counselling, the dole, sickness benefits and courses that lead to other courses. The government's policies have the effect of cold and flu tablets&mdash;you feel a little more comfortable but you are still sick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been sold out by our elected representatives to multinationals with trade agreements of no benefit to ordinary Australians. We are fed up with being told about the level playing field and tired of being the only ones playing this game; a game in which Australians cannot break even, let alone win, because other countries maintain their tariff barriers, quotas and other mechanisms to protect their own industries and jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obvious as this is to working Australians, our politicians fail to see or feel the anguish of our own people. Are politicians isolated from other Australians and removed from the truth seen in cities, suburbs and country towns across Australia, or is it something more sinister?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 1 July 1997, our government once again exposed an agenda lacking clear explanation or understanding. They dropped tariff protection on raw sugar and certain by-products, while other countries maintained high levels of protection. Thailand&mdash;perhaps our biggest competitor in this industry&mdash;maintains a tariff of 104 per cent. The United States, where the standard of living is much higher than that of Thailand but not as high as our own, maintains a tariff of 170 per cent. Free trade and the level playing field only work when the countries involved have a similar standard of living. Pursuit of such policies between countries with vastly different standards of living will result in a change for each country. Australia's decline is the perfect example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of the sugar industry review working party, dated December 1995, stated that $30 million per year would be slashed from the income of cane farmers in Queensland and New South Wales. The average farm 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cash income of Queensland's sugar growers has now fallen $3,000 per year due to the abolition of the sugar tariff. It is said that New South Wales sugar growers will suffer even greater losses. This money, which individually may not seem much to the very well looked after members of this House or to the directors of big business, has now been taken&mdash;one might say stolen&mdash;from rural communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since removing the sugar embargo in 1989, they have reduced the tariff from $115 per tonne to nothing. Yet, while they have continued to make sugar cheaper and the growers poorer, it seems that not even the Australian consumer has benefited. During these same years, the price of chocolate, soft drinks and cordials has also risen way above the CPI. The only obvious beneficiary of this tariff abolition is the almost 100 per cent foreign owned beverage and confectionary industry, which has apparently failed to pass on its savings to the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The textiles, clothing and footwear industries are also heading for oblivion. Tariff protection for the clothing industry will be reduced from 34 per cent to five per cent by 2008. On top of this, government assistance to this industry has already been reduced by 70 per cent in the past decade. Once again, while our government leads the way for the destruction of all that is Australian and Australian made, other countries are delaying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The US and Europe have introduced more quotas for TCF. Europe also makes extensive use of anti-dumping duties, and the US has modified its rules of origin to further protect its domestic market. The Industry Commission's draft report concedes that these countries will not abolish quotas on sensitive items until 2005. However, contrary to this report, the US and China have already negotiated to safeguard quotas until the year 2010. How they must all rub their hands together and laugh at the stupidity of Australia's desperate rush to destroy itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While others continue to negotiate to protect their industries and jobs, Australians open their newspapers each day to find more of our manufacturing becoming a thing of the past as they read of closures and job losses: 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7708"> Berlei, 180 jobs; Gloweave, 85 jobs; Coats Patons, 170 jobs; DuPont, 160 jobs&mdash;to name but a few. With these go hundreds of indirect jobs as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the loss of 180 jobs at Berlei from the small town of Lithgow, this is another kick in the guts for a community already isolated and suffering. For those who lose their jobs through government policies, the future is grim. Only 47 per cent of TCF workers find new jobs within two years of their retrenchment&mdash;and, of these, more than one-third accept employment at a lower wage. Each of these closures devastate hundreds of Australian families as people struggle to find work, with many forced to accept a much reduced standard of living just to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With more than 700,000 children now living in families where neither parent has a job, you would think our government would understand and correct this folly. Is our government stupid, simply the pawn of big business and international powerbrokers, or is their involvement an undisclosed act of treachery? If the government simply accepts the proposals of the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia, this will lead to renewed investment of $400 million to $500 million a year. Exports of elaborately processed TCF products will grow to $3.5 billion by the year 2005, and TCF industries will continue to purchase and consume domestic raw materials&mdash;further supporting local industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tariffs add only minimal cost to consumers. In the TCF industries, the effect of tariffs has been greatly exaggerated. The extra cost on a pair of shoes is about $2.50, and on underpants it is only about 20c. Who would object to these minimal costs when an individual's expenditure of perhaps as little as 20c or 30c a day would, according to the National Institute of Economic Research and Industry, keep another 50,000 Australians employed? Jobs will mean the security of countless thousands of families and children across Australia&mdash;50,000 people paying tax instead of being paid welfare; 50,000 people with a sense of purpose, pride, self-esteem and a future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means less substance abuse, less crime, less family breakdown and more hope for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> young Australians. I would pay the extra for this. Wouldn't you? In fact, surveys show that over 80 per cent of Australians are willing to pay a little more to preserve Australian manufacturing, production and Australian jobs. They know this will mean a better society and standard of living for us all. Companies that have so far survived the battle caused by government policies are to be applauded but they cannot fight on without help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Our textiles, clothing and footwear industries must have assurance of protection. But successive Liberal coalition and Labor governments, unchecked by Democrats, Greens and Independents, have shown they cannot be trusted. It is only One Nation that will ensure protection for Australian industry and Australian jobs. It is only we who have said this from the start, and our commitment has never wavered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The citrus industry is on its knees and, like a bully, the government is kicking sand in the face of these Australian growers. It is a national disgrace to see the man on the land ploughing perfectly good fruit into the ground because he cannot compete with cheap imports. It takes seven years for a tree to produce fruit and 10 years before a profit is made. When the government succeeds in destroying this industry, it will be gone forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tariff on oranges has been reduced from 30 per cent in 1987 to five per cent in 1996, without negotiation or equivalent cuts by other countries. Again, we see the government leading with the chin of our own people. Importation of citrus to other countries is still inhibited by heavy level levels&mdash;Thailand, over 50 per cent; Korea, 50 per cent to 80 per cent, depending on quota; and Japan up to 40 per cent. Clearly, there are many things Asia expects from us they would never expect from themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United States has a specific duty on frozen orange juice concentrate equivalent to a tariff of more than 58 per cent. Brazil has an effective tariff of over 40 per cent, and Israel's tariffs range to more than 60 per cent. The citrus industry can cope with the importation of oranges from Brazil but not the price 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7709"> of imported orange juice concentrate. Our citrus farmers cannot compete with the low costs of the Brazilian work force. They cannot compete with Brazil and pay of $2 per day to pick fruit or about $1 per tonne, when in Australia it costs our growers $53 per tonne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> When our government tells us we must be more productive to compete, what they really mean is `survive', because competing means having the same pay and the same standard of living as countries like Brazil. I question who our government is working for. If we consumed Australian citrus produce only, the Australian citrus industry would have to double in size to meet the demand. Protecting the Australian citrus industry will create wealth and jobs for Australians. However, if we do not stop the government from continuing its plans, either the citrus industry will disappear or many Australians involved in the industry will be living like the peasants of a Third World country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regarding product origin and appropriate labelling, I call on the government to amend the law so that `Made in Australia' means exactly that. At present, products labelled as `Made in Australia' may contain mostly foreign content. I say to you all: imported Brazilian concentrate plus Australian water does not equal `Made in Australia'. This is misleading, dishonest and does not provide consumers with information allowing them to choose a true Australian product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The current law is a stupid law meant to deceive the Australian people and deprive Australian producers of their identity and rightful place. If tariffs cost jobs, then why did Toyota invest another billion dollars into the plant at Altona and create another 400 jobs after the government decided to freeze tariff protection until 2005? When these tariffs go in 2005, Australian Toyota workers will either suffer huge pay cuts or complete loss of employment&mdash;Oh what a feeling!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as tariffs produced investment and jobs in the car industry, the same will happen in other industries. We are sick of the Liberal coalition and Labor sacrificing our jobs and the future of our children on the altar of economic rationalism and globalisation. The time is coming when the Liberal coalition and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor, along with their political allies&mdash;the Democrats and the Greens&mdash;will pay for their policies of betrayal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jobs that were once feeding Australian families are now feeding families in foreign lands. Millions of my fellow Australians have had enough. When government cease to serve the people, they no longer have the right to exist. The government are here only with the consent of the Australian people. So don't get too comfortable&mdash;a time of change is about to arrive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, is bending over backwards to push us into globalisation just as his predecessor, Gareth Evans, did, and as did every foreign minister and member of the government over at least the last 25 years. They want us to become part of Asia and they will happily lower our standard of living in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are still many true Australians&mdash;certainly enough to foil their self-seeking plans to discard our identity and our history, indeed to relinquish our sovereignty. Most politicians are only concerned for themselves. Their wages and standards of living have continued to rise, while their senseless and disastrous decisions have reduced many Australians to a breadline without hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our car industry has not been saved, merely given a stay of execution. The citrus industry is on its knees and sugar tariffs have been dropped. The planned importation of cooked chicken meat is also likely to lead to imported disease and the loss of a further 17,000 jobs in this industry alone. In coming years, countless thousands of jobs will be lost unless ordinary Australians teach the politicians the only lesson they understand, that is, by voting for someone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time our government was made up of patriots, not pawns; real Australians doing a job for Australia, not career politicians working for themselves. If possible, I would gladly remove tariffs on our current crop of politicians to see how they survive when unprotected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, like so many before it, has pandered to the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation and has dismally 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7710"> failed in its primary duty&mdash;the welfare of the Australian people. You who are currently in government and you on the opposition benches who hope to replace them will never be able to be trusted. You have all at one time or another been eager and active participants in, or at least party to, the free trade agenda. It is only as you sense your own necks may soon be on the block that a few of you whimper with some concern&mdash;not concern for Australia, but merely for your own miserable careers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people will not forget 25 years of selling out this country, nor will they forgive you for what you have done. They will always remember the price you made them pay. Make no mistake, the success of One Nation at the next election will mean an end to our falling standard of living and an end to the exportation of our jobs. We are committed to policies of tariffs and protectionism that will revitalise all that is Australian.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On indulgence: the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced ministerial arrangements on Monday of this week and said that the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) would be absent from question time for the week as he was attending an International Olympic Committee meeting in Switzerland, the full IOC session. He was attending that meeting on behalf of the government to lend support to the SOCOG presentation which is being given, to discuss the important issue of security at the forthcoming Sydney Olympic Games and to attend the announcement of the 2004 games.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During that time, the minister has been paired with various opposition members, including the member for Sydney (Mr Peter 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Baldwin), the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I raise this matter on indulgence because today the minister has been accused of failing to vote for a motion in the House moved by the opposition. He has been accused of failing to support the TCF industries. It is alleged that he supports them in his electorate but would not back his words with actions by voting for a proposal from the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This does the minister a gross injustice. He is overseas attending the business of the government. He has been quite wrongly and unfairly accused by the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with great interest to many of the contributions made on this <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R256">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 [No. 2]</XREF> . They have been many and varied&mdash;from a campaign speech to contributions from the opposition that bear little relevance to the facts before the House. In fact, very few of the opposition members have dealt with the real issues in this particular debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7711">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways this debate is redundant because, no matter what this House decides and no matter what the Senate decides, it will make no difference as far as the abolition of the tariff on sugar is concerned. It is a political stunt from the Labor Party and the rhetoric is quite incredible. As many members have said, the hypocritical rhetoric is quite incredible because it was the Labor Party which set up the sugar industry review working party&mdash;the Labor Party in Canberra and the Labor Party in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened with great interest to many members of the opposition when they were saying that the industry was forced by being told that, if they did not come up with an answer that was acceptable to competition policy, then they would lose their single desk status. Seeing that the review was set up under the Labor Party in Canberra and the Labor Party in Queensland, I need to ask: who was it that said they had to come up with that particular answer? I might come back to that later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sugar industry review working party came to Canberra to give their report. I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs. I listened with great interest to the report, where unanimously they say they made certain recommendations. Among those recommendations was the recommendation that the tariffs should be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations also went further and said that the working party believed that, because the industry had had a number of investigations over a number of years and they were thoroughly sick of being investigated, the industry wanted the government to act quickly on the recommendations that were put by the working party. It is my understanding they gave the same advice to the former Labor Queensland government, which, as I said, was a party to the setting up of the working party in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland government acted upon that advice. It immediately changed the formula, as the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) said earlier, for the price that is charged by the Queensland Sugar Corporation to the refineries in Australia. As the member 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for Richmond quite rightly said, it does not matter what the tariff is&mdash;it does not matter whether the tariff is $1,000 a tonne&mdash;the real issue is that price at which sugar is sold to the refiners in Australia is set by the Queensland Sugar Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tariff is not collected, unlike on imports of motor cars or the TCF products such as shoes and clothing. In the past the tariff was added to the price that was charged to the refiners. So it does not matter, as I have said, what happens here or what happens in the Senate because, once that decision was taken by the Queensland government on the advice of the sugar industry review working party, then the tariff ceased to exist and have any influence on the price of sugar in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also been said&mdash;I think the member for Richmond mentioned this&mdash;that New South Wales was not represented on the sugar industry review working party. That is quite true. That is a slight on the New South Wales cane growers by the former Labor government. They never bothered to allow the New South Wales industry to have a say on an issue which is very important to the growers in New South Wales. It was mentioned by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) that this decision will have a greater effect on the growers in New South Wales than on the growers in Queensland. It will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been estimated that it will probably cost individual growers in New South Wales between $3 and $4 a tonne depending on what the domestic price does in the next few years. The member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) mentioned that that, along with the decision that was also taken by the sugar industry review working party to abolish the pools, will cost North Queensland something like $1.60 a tonne of sugarcane and southern Queensland $1.40 a tonne of sugarcane. It is having repercussions right across the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That particular decision has repercussions on new growers and old growers. Established growers who used to grow for No. 1 pool in Queensland, on the Burdekin in fact, will be disadvantaged vis-a-vis expanding new growers in the industry. While these types of decisions might obscure the real issue in this debate&mdash;and they are readily used by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7712"> opposition, the Labor Party&mdash;you really have to get to the facts to understand exactly what is causing the changes in values to growers in New South Wales and within districts in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look very closely at some of these issues. As many members have said, quite rightly, it was the Labor Party that set up this review into the industry. It was the Labor Party in government that was anxious to pursue this as vigorously as they possibly could. The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) in his contribution, egged on by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), read a report from Mr Laurie Oakes in which Mr Laurie Oakes said that the growers were mugged. I find that rather interesting. I have had reason to question statements from Mr Oakes in the past and I question this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's sugar industry task force, of which I am a member, took evidence up and down the coast of New South Wales and Queensland. One of the things I was interested in was the fact that the statement was made that the industry had no option. They had to accept this because they would have lost their single desk status. Yet when people who were close to the sugar industry review working party were questioned they said that that was not the case. They were not forced. They were not told. They did have to take into consideration the competition policy, but they were not told that they had to come to a decision such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you have to look very closely at the representatives who were part of the sugar industry review working party. There is no doubt it was a unanimous decision. You cannot back away from that. There is no use you going back to your agricultural constituency and saying, `We were forced,' because their representatives were on that committee. There were three growers on the committee and they were: the Chairman of the Queensland Canegrowers Council, Mr Harry Bonanno; the President of the Australian Cane Farmers Association, Mr Verri; and the Chairman of Mackay Sugar Cooperative and a refiner, Mr Graham Davies. There was also a cane grower on the committee. They were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> party to the recommendation that was put to the minister and to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the Labor opposition to have the temerity to stand up here and say that if they had a recommendation from the leaders of the sugar industry to abolish the tariff they would not have accepted it they must believe that all of us believe in the sugar fairy. There is no doubt in my mind that they would have acted exactly the same way. I and other members of the government realised that the recommendation was going to have some effects on cane growers and that there would be individuals across the industry affected by this decision in a lumpy fashion. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sugar decision is exactly what the federal Labor Party would now be proposing if it were still in government. The recommendation to scrap the tariff comes from a unanimous report of the sugar industry review working party which included representatives of both cane growers and sugar users that Labor set up.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that puts it very clearly. If the Labor Party had  been in government they would have had to accept the recommendation from the sugar industry as this government has had to accept the recommendation from the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now have a close look at the recommendation which says that the Queensland Sugar Corporation should sell to the Australian refiners at export parity prices. I do have a difference of opinion on this particular issue. I think in competition policy&mdash;and this comes from a simple position of having been in competition in business myself&mdash;you look closely at your competitors and you analyse exactly what they might be able to put a competitive product on the market for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our nearest competitor is Thailand, as people have mentioned. If you take into consideration the New York No. 11 spot price, which is considered to be the world market price, and if you have a look at the cost of freight from Thailand to, say, the port of Brisbane and the cost of transferring that sugar from the port of Brisbane to a refinery, I believe that should be the price that is set in Australia. That is the price at which a competitor can put sugar into the Australian market. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7713">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Gentile, of course, disagrees with this because he wants to feather the pockets of the multinationals. As has been said before by many speakers, there is absolutely no evidence that these people have been passing on to the consumers the savings that they have been receiving&mdash;no evidence at all. Undoubtedly, on the committee, Mr Gentile would have been using the influence he had to ensure that the proposition that I have just put would not have been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the minister's task force we asked some questions about what was the estimated cost of transporting and delivering sugar to an Australian sugar refinery from, say, Thailand. The estimate was $US38 per tonne. I have to say that the recommendation made by the working party, in saying that the tariff would be abolished, has transferred effectively $A37 a tonne from the growers and millers in Australia across to the refiners, who have flick&hyphen;passed it on to the manufacturers. It is taken from the growers and millers because, as anyone who knows the industry would know, the price that the QSC gets for the sugar is what is divided up between the industry. The division of sugar moneys takes about one&hyphen;third to the millers and two&hyphen;thirds to the growers. That money has been taken from that sector of the industry and given to the manufacturers, I would claim. I do not see any reason why the price in Australia should not be set at export parity price, because export parity price is the cheapest price for which anyone could put sugar into this country and, of course, it would benefit the growers and millers, which the debate is about at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that it is going to serve any useful purpose in this House for me to vote against this measure. I am very cognisant of the effects that it is going to have. But what I do say is that the major effect on the Australian producers at the present time has been overcapacity in the refining sector of the industry. That could have been easily averted a lot earlier by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very early on, going back before the Australian Competition and Consumer Commis 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sion, there was really one refiner in Australia&mdash;CSR. There was a small refinery at Millaquin, at Bundaberg. But there was really only one refiner until the New South Wales industry decided, because of reasons that I will not go into tonight&mdash;but it was for competitive reasons and the fact that they had been asked by people in Australia who were buying sugar who were dissatisfied with the actions of CSR at the time&mdash;that they would build a refinery at Harwood. The growers in New South Wales and their partner, Manildra, had been guaranteed a market. They did not go ahead and build a refinery out of the blue; they were guaranteed a market. They were at a disadvantage because of decisions that had been taken in Queensland which would have effectively made it very difficult for them to survive, so they went ahead in a joint venture to build a refinery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequent to that, Mackay Cooperatives showed an interest in building a refinery in Mackay. CSR, which at the time had refineries in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, said it was interested in going into a joint venture with Mackay, and that was rejected. That is one reason that has caused most of the pain in the Australian industry, not the tariff. The tariff had nothing to do with it. It was the pain in the domestic industry because of the overcapacity of refineries in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the ludicrous situation because the Mackay refinery, although not allowed to amalgamate with CSR, went ahead and produced one of the biggest refineries in Australia, without a market. They never had a customer. So they were forced to go into the marketplace and cut the price. We have seen the situation in the last few years where the Mackay cane growers have been subsidising the refinery to the tune of about $10 million to $12 million a year. That is painful to them too. I think that is something that at least now seems to be reversed because the ACCC has said that because of the lifting of the tariff they will now agree that CSR and Mackay can merge and close down the refinery at New Farm in Brisbane, which should take some capacity out of the marketplace. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7714">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That will do more for the Australian industry than all the debate here about tariffs, because really the thing that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission forgot to think about, when they refused that merger in the first place, was the fact that we cannot get into the markets overseas with refined sugar. They said there should have been more competition in the Australian refined sugar industry. There is a certain capacity&mdash;somewhere around a million tonnes&mdash;that we can use in Australia. That is not all refined; some of that goes to manufacturers. But we cannot export refined sugar because we cannot get into the markets. You will find that the tariff on refined sugar is a lot higher than on raw sugar. The commission did not take that into account when they refused the merger in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say to the House that one of the things that we, as members of this House, must push for is to see that the spirit of the World Trade Organisation is adhered to, because there is no doubt in my mind that some of those countries that have signed the agreement will be fairly tardy about moving towards a reduction in the protection that they have at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the visits that I had to the USA, to the European Community and to Japan I did not see any willingness, quite frankly, to move quickly. I think the political reality is that they cannot. Australia will have to be ever vigilant to ensure that we are reducing protection in Australia and that we are showing to the world that we are not going to be a protectionist country. We also need to see that those countries of the world reciprocate because, as other members have said, there are very many tariffs, non&hyphen;tariff barriers and subsidies around the world that make the whole trading area very corrupt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that we put some perspective into this debate here today on this particular issue. I repeat what I said earlier: no matter what we do in this House and no matter what is done in the Senate, it will have no bearing at all on the price that growers and millers get in Australia because the decision has been taken and the price has been set. You can have a tariff of any value whatsoever but it will be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of no benefit to the growers and millers in Australia. In many ways this debate has been a political exercise. It has been an exercise in trying to confuse, it has been rhetoric, and it has been hypocrisy. I think that most people in Australia will see it for that. I hope that some sanity will come back into the marketplace in Australia because sanity in the marketplace will deliver to the growers and millers in Australia a lot more than the debate over tariffs.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) gives effect to the Howard government's decision to abolish the sugar tariff from 1 July this year. The effect of this measure on sugar farmers has been well documented before in this debate, and I do not propose to go over that ground today. Quite simply put, it will mean a loss of income for sugar producers of around $29 million and will lead to some job losses in the regions which sustain this very important industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the original Robin Hood bill but it has a typically Liberal twist to it: the bill robs from the poor and gives to the rich. The bill will pull $29 million out of the pockets of sugarcane growers in Queensland and northern New South Wales and pour it into the pockets of multinational companies. Those are the facts and they cannot be denied by any member of the government who comes in here to try to defend this decision.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7716">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill takes from the very sector in the Australian economy that can least afford it&mdash;the battlers in rural areas, the man on the land, the Aussie price taker. They are the heart and soul of rural and regional Australia. It takes that $29 million out of those rural battlers' pockets and it puts it in the pockets of the multinational companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sugar producers in northern New South Wales and Queensland have every reason to feel betrayed and somewhat dismayed at the actions of the Howard government on this particular issue. But we on this side of the House are not really surprised by the deceit of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or of the government and backbenchers on this particular issue. After all, this is the Prime Minister who rather cutely can go to the Australian people and categorise the promises that he makes into core promises and non-core promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one thing that farmers in this country appreciate, and that is honesty and straight talking. That is what they appreciate. There are very few farmers in this country who will make you a promise and go blatantly back on their word. But, as the sugar farmers know now, there are a few farmers in Australia who will be blatant in the deceit and blatant in breaking the promises that they make. They know that those farmers are in this parliament in the backbench and the frontbench of the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the last election a very specific commitment was given to sugar farmers in Queensland and northern New South Wales. That particular commitment was well documented last night by the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) in the speech that he made to this House. Page 32 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reviving the heartland: building a sustainable future for Australia's primary industries</EMPHASIS> of 5 February 1996 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Liberal&hyphen;National Government will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55/tonne as we have already met our obligations under the World Trade Organisation (GATT `94) agreements;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You would need to be a dunce or stupid to read that and not understand what it says. It says: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Liberal&hyphen;National Government will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55/tonne . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I ask members opposite: you made this statement; you made the promise to the Queensland sugar growers; you made the promise to the New South Wales sugar growers. What did the words mean? We will tell you what they meant. It was another non-core promise made by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you this, Prime Minister: when farmers are made a promise, they expect the government of the day to stick to the deal. They expect them to stick to the promise. But you, Mr Prime Minister, and your cabinet, in this bill and this measure before the Australian parliament today have ratted on the sugar producers of northern Queensland and the sugar producers of northern New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular measure to abolish the sugar tariff has been indeed a bitter pill for many coalition members to swallow. We have had a couple of them come into the parliament and give their mea culpas in this House already simply because they know they have been dudded by city based Liberal cabinet ministers. They have not been rolled by real farmers; they have been rolled by city slickers&mdash;the Liberal Collins Street farmers who dominate the cabinet, those in the A team who mug the B team on this issue. I will have a little bit to say about that later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give my dues to the honourable member for Kennedy for coming into this House and apologising to those sugarcane farmers who were deceived by the Prime Minister and who were deceived by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). I see the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) coming into House, somebody for whom I have particular admiration because of his honesty in these matters. He comes in triumphant from his win over the Prime Minister and his win over the cabinet on the issue of communications policy. I am asking this very powerful National Party committee chair to use his influence to overturn this measure and to take out of the pockets of the multinationals the $29 million and put it back into the pockets of his cane growers and other 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7717"> cane growers in northern Queensland and New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Kennedy came into this House and delivered an excellent speech coming off the back of his intimate knowledge of the sugar industry in his state. He expressed his bitter disappointment at the decision that had been taken by the cabinet. It is a disappointment that is echoed up and down the length and breadth of Queensland and northern New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the sugar growers who feel betrayed by the coalition's broken promises since coming to office. Right across rural and regional Australia, farmers and regional dwellers have become extremely angry at the cynical betrayal of their interests by city based Liberal ministers. First we had the abandonment of the rural development program. The coalition made a specific promise to retain that program and the benefits that it was accruing to regional areas. They made a very specific promise. But of course, as we know now, it was one of those non&hyphen;core promises that are made by the Prime Minister, and that program was abandoned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They made promises to retain labour market programs. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) would know, because he is close to the dairy farming industry in the Western District of Victoria&mdash;and I see him in this House tonight&mdash;it was those labour market programs put in place by the Australian Labor Party in government that delivered over 1,000 trainees to the dairy industry. It was a very important component of the ongoing training of dairy farmers and of bringing the skills of that industry up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the coalition made a discreet promise to retain that program&mdash;another non&hyphen;core promise. They just roll off the back of the old sugar truck. It is quite unbelievable&mdash;another promise made to retain these labour market programs which benefited people in rural and regional areas. Now we find that that promise has been broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition also made a very strong commitment to export promotion programs on which many rural producers and value adding producers in regional areas have relied. That was another promise that was made and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> broken. Honourable members in this House know very well that the overwhelming part of the rural output of this nation is exported. Those companies&mdash;the Queensland Sugar Corporation and the other rural cooperatives that are engaged in the promotion and selling of their products overseas&mdash;rely very much on the export promotion support that they receive from the federal government. Another non&hyphen;core promise! How many can you make, and how many can you break before you are struck out? The sugar cane farmers have finally woken up; the beef producers have woken up; and people in rural and regional areas have woken up that they have been betrayed&mdash;and they are very bitter about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In rural and regional areas job losses have been initiated by this government. Workers in rural and regional areas have had their job security blown out of the water by the Prime Minister's industrial relations legislation. They fear for their economic future, as they see that the Howard government has failed to match the economic growth targets that were left to them by Labor in the previous four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have seen the Treasurer (Mr Costello) hop into their great rural cooperatives, trying to tax them out of business&mdash;change their taxation status. And they have seen the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) rat on a coalition undertaking on meat inspection fees. It is little wonder that the primary industries minister is afraid to go out into rural and regional areas, and to explain the number of non&hyphen;core promises that were made that have not been lived up to by this government. The problem with Minister Anderson is that he is now hobnobbing with the Collins Street farmers in this Liberal dominated cabinet. That is his problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is reasonable to ask the question: why has the government proceeded with this measure? There ought to be some inherent and overwhelming logic that propels a Prime Minister to break a direct promise made to the sugar growers of this nation. There must be an overwhelming reason. There must be some compelling reason that would propel the Prime Minister and other members of the cabinet&mdash;supported by many rural Liberals and National Party members on the back 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7718"> bench&mdash;to pick up the bit of dirt and throw it in the face of the sugarcane farmers of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where do we look for the answer? Could it be that there is some overwhelming benefit to Australian consumers in the measure that is now before the House and being put by the government? We have heard from National Party members in this place that there is no overriding benefit to consumers to flow from this piece of legislation. So I racked my brains and thought that it must be something to do with our obligations under the World Trade Organisation; there must be some overwhelmingly compelling reason in our trading commitments for the government to have taken this action now to pull $29 million out of the pockets of sugar producers and put it in the pockets of the multinationals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the evidence&mdash;and it was well documented by the member for Kennedy&mdash;we see that in Japan there is a subsidy of 481 per cent; in Europe a subsidy tariff equivalent of 193 per cent; and in the United States it is 175 per cent. I think there is a very simple explanation for all this. It is to be found in the machinations of the Prime Minister's cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it was the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) who let the cat out of the bag, and the shadow minister for primary industry, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), brought the explanation to the attention of this parliament in quite dramatic fashion. There is an A team and a B team in the federal cabinet. Those are not my words; that is the assessment of the Howard cabinet by a member of the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion, the B team led by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy got rolled by the A team&mdash;got mugged, as Laurie Oakes said in his article, by the Prime Minister and the A team. It is really a case of `the tale of two muggings'. The sugar industry got mugged by the B team, as the member for Burke quite correctly points out; and then the A team mugged the B team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The upshot of all this is that a pack of mugs in the cabinet have taken $29 million out of the pockets of sugarcane farmers and put it in the pockets of the multinationals. That is the situation that has got the Queens 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> land sugar industry up in arms. Of course, there is intolerable political pressure being brought to bear on those coalition members who occupy the sugar seats in northern Queensland. On 7 July, the Cairns City Council expressed their concern about this measure. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is again with great concern that this Council, which has two large sugar mills in its local authority area and another three large mills in its immediate region, writes to express its concern in regard to the loss of the sugar tariff.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They document some $5 million going out of the Cairns regional economy because of the measures that have been instituted by this government. Finally, the Cairns City Council said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It can be clearly seen that the industry and region cannot afford the tariff loss at this point in time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is a very honest assessment of the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned the honourable member for Kennedy. I must say the honourable member has gone up in my estimation because of his contribution to this debate. I have read it. The honourable member for Corangamite might be sneering up there at his National Party colleague and the position that he has taken, but I have read the speech closely and I suggest that he does. I have marked for the honourable member for Corangamite those particular parts of this speech which are of relevance to this debate, if he would like to see them. I really do have some sympathy for the honourable member for Kennedy. He was honest enough to come into this chamber last night and express his disappointment. This is what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am deeply disappointed because, like so many people, I had such high hopes for the coalition government. When I heard our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) say, `No more nothing for nothing,' I thought at long last we were going to become, as we once were, a very aggressive trading nation. But, clearly, with decisions such as this, that is not to be.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You see, the honourable member for Kennedy has been mugged by the Prime Minister and the A team. I think it is a tragedy for those coalition members who went to their electorates in good faith, I suspect, because I know some of them personally. They stood up in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7719"> their electorates before their community, before their farmers, and they gave the rock&hyphen;solid promise in the coalition platform that they would retain the tariff. Then they have to come in here and apologise on the floor of this House to Queensland and to northern New South Wales for the fact that they have been dudded by the Prime Minister. They have been ambushed by the Prime Minister and the A team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a disgraceful measure that the government has introduced. It is disgraceful for one particular reason: farmers across the length and breadth of Queensland and northern New South Wales were looked straight in the eye and made a promise. They were then ratted on by the Prime Minister, other members and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. You will pay a heavy political price in the sugar seats for this duplicity. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

I thank the member for Corio for his kind remarks about me, but I was not in conflict with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on this matter of the media. In opening my remarks, I would like to respond to that comment by saying that I think the Prime Minister's decision was one of good judgment and commonsense. I applaud it and I endorse it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the economy, the southern half of my electorate of Hinkler has no industry as important as sugar. It involves 1,200 growers, 1,100 mill employees and a number of by&hyphen;product manufacturing enterprises such as Bundaberg Rum. It goes even further to farm machinery and to port development. It is a $2 billion industry for Australia producing 5.4 million tonnes of sugar each year, 85 per cent of it for export. It is not surprising, then, that matters such as the tariff and the future of the sugar industry are of paramount importance to my constituents and to their futures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To track the history of the removal of the tariff, one needs to look back at the Hilmer process and understand, given there was a review of the sugar industry, what effect it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> might have. The sugar industry review working party was established in September 1995. I remind the member for Corio and others who have spoken in this debate that that was established by the Labor Party. It was representative of all sections of the industry: the growers, the millers, the users and others. The working party spent an exhaustive 14 months examining many aspects of the sugar industry, including the basis for a tariff on raw and refined sugar and the current legislative arrangements for the promotion and regulation of the sugar industry in Queensland, with the objective of investigating alternative arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the tariff on raw and refined sugar and related products, the working party considered many other factors, including the export dominance of the industry; the effect of the tariff on cane growers and mill owners in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia; its effect on refiners and user industries; and, finally, its effect on consumers and Australian society in general. It looked at the international trade obligations and the effects of the tariff on the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legislative aspects of the sugar industry considered included the Customs Act, the Sugar Industry Act 1991 and the Sugar Milling Rationalisation Act 1991. This was a very comprehensive study. The ultimate priority of the working party was to facilitate the sustainable development of an internationally competitive, export oriented industry with benefits to industry participants and the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot look at an industry like this in isolation. You cannot say that, because you made a promise at the election that has been subsumed by a report which makes a recommendation which is endorsed by the peak body of that industry, you can walk away from it&mdash;no government could walk away from it. It is not a matter of a broken promise; it is a matter of a different set of circumstances subsuming the original commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The working party made a number of recommendations which ultimately would provide the Queensland sugar industry with a degree of planning certainty. Some of those recommendations were: the strengthening of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7720"> the anti&hyphen;dumping laws to protect the sugar industry and removing the tariff on raw and refined sugar; continuing the single desk selling arrangements in Queensland, which would ensure a strong bartering power on world markets and the stability of the domestic sugar market; restructuring the Queensland Sugar Corporation to make it the body responsible for buying raw sugar produced in Queensland and marketing it both domestically and internationally, and restricting its regulatory functions to those which are central to its marketing role; the phasing out of the price differential, to be six per cent for the 1997 season, four per cent for 1998 and eliminated for the 1999 season; and ensuring that new opportunities for innovation, value adding and downstream processing of raw sugar in the domestic market are fully explored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As other speakers have said, there were 74 recommendations. Another recommendation was that the Queensland bulk sugar terminals should be owned and operated as one entity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have laboured that point a little because I think it is important. It was not just a matter of coalition members going back on the commitment to keep the tariff, albeit that it was down to eight per cent, but that it was subsumed by the recommendations of a very searching, balanced report. The report was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sugar&mdash;winning globally</EMPHASIS>, and so it should have been, because 85 per cent of our sugar is exported and that is where Australia's wealth comes from in regard to sugar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report received unanimous support from the members of the working party&mdash;people like Harry Bonanno, Ron Verri and Graham Davies, all of them associated with sugar production. In their letter accompanying the report to the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, Trevor Perrett, those people  said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report, in our opinion, is a balanced package for the sugar industry in as much as the recommendations retain the best features of existing arrangements but at the same time recommends significant changes, gives more commercial focus, encourages innovation, further facilitates research and development, and embraces environmental and social issues. It additionally gives greater empowerment to industry participants by increasing their involve 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment in decision making by providing greater administrative flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What could be more comprehensive and more all&hyphen;embracing than that statement? That was a unanimous recommendation to the government by millers, growers, users and an independent chairman. I say that that was a reasonable basis upon which the government should not have been held to its commitment to retain that tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point let me dispel a few myths. The working party also made the following statement&mdash;and I refer now to the tariffs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Australian sugar tariff is significantly lower than those in other major sugar&hyphen;producing countries, it is still high in comparison with other tariffs in the Australian economy. The working party sees little justification in retaining a sugar tariff at a level which is out of step with other Australian tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That came from this working party. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, the working party has not found a compelling case for maintaining the tariff and recommends&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I stress that word `recommends'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it be removed from 1 July 1997 as part of an overall package of measures designed to improve the international competitiveness and sustainability of the industry and to implement the principles of National Competition Policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I say to members of the Labor Party that they initiated that report, drew up the terms of reference and appointed the personnel to the study. Having received such an all&hyphen;embracing recommendation, I challenge the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans): would you or would you not have accepted the recommendation of the industry? Clearly, you would have. Had you not done so, you would have been out of step with your own policy on the one hand and with the recommendation of the industry on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, I was briefed personally by state executives of the Queensland Canegrowers Council, who asked me to support the whole package. The state chairman, Mr Harry Bonanno, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 19 December 1996, in saying that the process was a sensible alternative to total deregulation, went on to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7721">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'd love to have a protected industry, but that seems to be impossible under competition policy and our members will understand that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I again remind the shadow minister at the table that it was his party that introduced the competition policy, and it was the imperative that drove the working party and the working party's recommendations. So to come into this House and bleat about the eight per cent tariff at this stage is sheer hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where do I stand on this matter? We must ask ourselves just what a tariff is meant to do. Put simply, it is there to protect a local product or manufacture from an unfairly priced foreign import. That is the role of a tariff. When we look at sugar, we can see no danger of that sort of thing occurring in the medium term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another factor that we need to look at is that the governments have constructed a price which included a $55 tariff, and that was only able to be captured because of the single desk selling status. But with the working party recommendation to move to export parity pricing&mdash;and the member for Page (Mr Causley) made this point very clearly&mdash;no matter how the Senate votes on this issue, it is unlikely that the sugar industry will ever be seriously challenged. If it were, and if there were a tariff in place, in these circumstances the penalties on the imported product would flow to the government, not to the growers. Again, a lot of what the opposition has said is just so much hot air.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, we should recognise that because of searing competition between refineries, bringing the Australian price of refined sugar below international levels, the New South Wales industry has virtually gained no benefit from the tariff for the last two years. I suspect that when the opposition was in government it knew this, and knew it well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other speakers have said&mdash;and I endorse this&mdash;that there is a vast distinction between the TCF and motor vehicle tariffs on the one hand and sugar on the other. The distinction is that the sugar industry working party unanimously endorsed the removal of the tariff as part of a package and recommended it to state and federal governments. I have held the personal view for some time&mdash;and I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do not resile from this&mdash;that the tariff should have been phased out at two per cent per year over four years and that the New South Wales sugar industry, which had been totally focused on refining, should have been readmitted to the raw sugar export market at 1&frac14; per cent a year over the same four&hyphen;year period. I believe that would have eased a lot of hardship to both the Queensland and New South Wales industries. In desiring to have that little variation, which it was not possible to have, I do not resile from the government's role in the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to speak about the hypocrisy of the opposition and the Labor Party in general on the matter of tariffs. In Labor's economic statement of 1988 they announced that the embargo on sugar would be replaced by an ad valorem tariff of 35 per cent on raw sugar and 25 per cent on refined sugar. Following a Senate select committee report&mdash;they listened to reports, but they did not want us to listen to the working party report&mdash;this was set at $115 per tonne until July 1989, to fall to $95 per tonne in July 1991, and then to fall to $70 per tonne in July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Labor economic statement of 1991, only three years later, they dropped that still further. They dropped the $95 level of 1991 to $76 and the $70 level of 1992 to $55. Nothing could more amply illustrate Labor's intention to progressively reduce tariffs and then to eliminate them. In fact, in the Labor Party's policy statement for the 1993 election, there is a strong allusion to this happening&mdash;by that I mean the removal of the sugar tariff. The ALP stated in that policy initiative that, subject to the Uruguay Round being effective&mdash;and they claimed in this parliament time and time again that it was effective, so we must presume that they would go on with it&mdash;they would review tariffs further, and they could only review them if the Uruguay Round was successful. The only inference we can draw from that was that they would review them downwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the Labor Party's track record? Let us look at the percentage of assistance which you granted to industries in the period from 1983 to 1989 and projected to the year 2000. I will just take a few of them, seeing that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7722"> clothing and footwear have been mentioned so much today. These figures are not just tariffs; they are other forms of assistance, including bounties. Listen to this. The Labor Party dropped clothing and footwear from 227 per cent in 1983 to 113 per cent in 1989 and would have dropped it to 34 per cent by the year 2000; machinery and equipment dropped from 22 per cent to 19 per cent, then down to six per cent; food beverages and tobacco dropped from six per cent to four per cent, and then down to two per cent. So we must assume that, had you been given another term, we would have seen clothing and footwear down to around 34 per cent, machinery down to about six per cent and food, beverages and tobacco on average down to about two per cent. My source for this is the Industry Commission report dated March 1995 called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Assistance to agriculture and manufacturing industries.</EMPHASIS> Let me quote a paragraph from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proportion of manufacturing output receiving a nominal rate of assistance of 5 per cent or less increased from 18 per cent in 1970&hyphen;71 to 29 per cent in 1989&hyphen;90. By 2000&hyphen;2001, 85 per cent of manufacturing export is projected to have a nominal rate of 5 per cent or less. At the other end of the scale, 72 per cent of the output received assistance greater than 15 per cent in 1970&hyphen;71. This had fallen to 24 per cent in 1989&hyphen;90 and is projected to fall to three per cent by the year 2000&hyphen;01.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, by the year 2000 your tariffs for things like sugar would have been&mdash;on your own recommendations and on the reports of the Industry Commission&mdash;on average down around three per cent; and you have the hypocrisy to come into the House and berate us! That sums up 13 years of Labor tariff and trade policies and says where they were taking us. We are told we should judge a person on their past performance, not on what they say. Let us look at what the opposition said in government. They are always saying that we broke a promise, so we will see how good their promises were and how much they lived up to their statements. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has been most vocal on this issue. On 9 November 1990, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in addition, we are winding back the protective wall that the tariff produces because the real problem with the tariff is that it makes us look internally, domestically. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>  on 28 February 1991 the member for Hotham said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I'm not a believer in the level playing field, but I am also a believer in the fact that part of the reason that we have got into the industrial mess we have is because we have relied heavily on tariff protection in the past.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Note the words `industrial mess because we have relied heavily on tariff protection in the past'. On 28 February 1992 on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Today</EMPHASIS>  the member for Hotham said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that many of the media do not appreciate that all that tariffs did was to make us look inward. All the tariffs did was to protect local production. There is no basis upon which there was international competition to drive innovation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was your own spokesman for primary industries at the time. It is absolutely disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to finish on the matter of how we can give greater assistance to the sugar industry. I tell the parliamentary secretary that we can give greater assistance to the industry by government getting involved in assisting industry at the input end. I suggest that governments should be looking at having more infrastructure; and by infrastructure, I refer in particular to water infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Bundaberg district, we could increase production in sugar by 50 per cent. Most of that would go on the international market to gain hard&hyphen;earned dollars for this government. We could do that with the input of a dam worth $150 million at Kalliwa, and a combined operation of growers, state government and federal government could achieve that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on state, federal and local government and the growers to look at a dam in the Kalliwa area at a place called Paradise, and to help the cane growing industry, not by this senseless, meaningless debate in the parliament that the opposition has conducted, but rather by doing something practical that will allow cane growers to be more productive and to integrate vertically.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S111">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</XREF>  [No. 2] epitomises the failure of the Howard government in industry policy. I say that because of two specific examples which are to be found in the customs tariff 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7723"> proposals now before the House. One of those relates to the sugar industry&mdash;and those areas have been amply canvassed by many of my colleagues who have preceded me in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the Howard government's intentions in relation to the sugar industry are made very clear in this bill. They are to reduce the tariff on sugar to zero and to do so in a way which will clearly threaten the viability of that industry and the efforts of many sugar growers in this country who have established a very important rural industry over decades&mdash;indeed, over generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those families have worked what are often smaller plots which are now moving towards a more economic form of production but which for years, for generations, have provided employment and economic growth in the far north of Queensland and, more recently, in other parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That industry is a mature agricultural industry which has contributed to our economy over many decades. The reality is that that industry had an existing tariff in place, it had arrangements which people well understood, and the government has moved in and changed those arrangements. It has undermined the foundation on which that industry was established, in the same way that it tried to do with the motor vehicle industry and with the TCF industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To understand the impact of the government's proposals in relation to tariff changes, you need only look at the impact on those two industries&mdash;cars and textiles, clothing and footwear in particular. Sugar is the industry immediately under debate tonight, and that is being treated in exactly the same way. But in terms of the impact across the community, and certainly in my own district of Bonython, where both the motor vehicle industry and the TCF industries are particularly strong, the impact of the government's proposed changes on tariffs would have been most dramatic and very detrimental to those local communities, and certainly to South Australia's regional economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the government was forced to change its disastrous policy tack&mdash;forced to change not only by opposition from within 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the motor vehicle industry itself but by opposition from the Labor Party in this place and from the work force in my own district and across the country&mdash;those changes would have been disastrous. They would have undermined the confidence of investors in that industry and ensured that they would not have known where their investment would be in a few years time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that that industry is highly dependent on long&hyphen;term investments. The government's proposals, as originally put forward in the Productivity Commission report which the government was forced to quickly thereafter repudiate, would have ensured that we could not have maintained the high level of investment in the motor vehicle industry which we have enjoyed to date and which has supported very substantial growth in exports and in employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same is true in the TCF industries. Some 1,200 people in my district work in the TCF industries, about 5,000 throughout South Australia as a whole, and obviously many more nationally. The dramatic changes which the interim report of the Productivity Commission recommended, including significant reductions in the tariff protection available to that industry, would again have decimated that industry in the way that the implementation of the report on the motor vehicle industry would have done in that case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that public opposition to this is not based just on this issue of reducing tariffs; it is based on the whole mechanism by which the government approaches these questions. Yes, it is true that the Labor Party has in the past been involved in tariff reductions. Yes, we were guilty, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, of reducing tariffs in the past, but we have done that in a context. We have done that in a framework which has allowed for rational investment in the industry, for forward looking proposals, for export incentives, for export enhancement packages to be part of that whole proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, it is true that the Labor Party has in the past supported reductions in tariffs in various industries, but you have to see that in the context in which it was done. We have only supported that where it was part of an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7724"> industry specific plan, where it was part of our overall industry policy. So yes, we are guilty of managed reform, but that is a guilt which I think we can readily accept, and it is one which the community would have supported had the government continued that process rather than diverging, as it has, into a path lacking in any plan, lacking in any basis of future investment direction, lacking in a coordinated industry&hyphen;wide response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why there has been concerted opposition in the community. That is why the motor vehicle, TCF and sugar industries have risen up and responded to these changes in the way that they have. While we have been involved in these things in the past, it has been in the context of a managed process of reform which ensured that, as tariffs fell, investment in the industry was coordinated and rose, which ensured that export incentives were in place. In the case of the motor vehicle industry, that has allowed that industry to now be a major exporter, with over $1 billion in exports; and certainly we have moved forward in the component area as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have done that for a number of reasons. One reason has been the export incentive packages, which the former government put in place and which in many cases this government has sought to tear down as part of its rush to zero tariffs. Another reason has been our investment in research and development and our investment in an industry policy for this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government has certainly failed its traditional industry&mdash;in this case, the sugar industry&mdash;and also those traditional industries of manufacturing, of TCF, of motor vehicles. It is also failing our sunrise industries. This bill epitomises the Howard government's failure in industry policy, not only in the mature industries but also in the sunrise industries, because part of this bill is the ratification of the free trade agreement in information technology&mdash;a decision which has had very important implications for global trade and for Australia's place in that global trade and electronic commerce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has this government done in relation to sunrise industries? The Prime Minister went to the United States and discovered the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> information technology industry. We all know that he had meetings with President Clinton and, as part of his discussions with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in the United States, he discovered that information technology had been a very substantial part of the increase in productivity in the economy of the United States in recent years. That is quite true, but it is a bit sad that the Prime Minister only learned that on a recent visit to the United States. Some of us have known that for quite a while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he came back, he discovered that many of the policy settings he had put in place prior to leaving for the United States and prior to making this significant discovery and personal journey into productivity are actually counterproductive to his new policy. For example, he discovered information technology, but that was only after he had put in place an outsourcing process for IT in the federal government purchasing process, which will severely disadvantage Australian IT producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Outsourcing contracts now require, and are likely to require in the future, that suppliers meet various criteria, including a criterion that they are able to produce some 250,000 computer units a year in order to be eligible to be part of these government contracts. These and other tender conditions in the outsourcing process are clearly contrary to the best interests of Australia in the long term. They prohibit many of our small and medium sized enterprises which are active in the IT area from being part of the IT revolution and from enjoying the growth which otherwise they might have, had the government had a proactive industry policy in the area of IT outsourcing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government have also decided to privatise Telstra. As part of that decision, we will see a significant share of the contracts for the supply of telecommunications equipment again going offshore. Once Telstra is in private hands, the incentive to ensure that they have an adequate industry development policy and that they purchase their equipment and supplies from local suppliers&mdash;that is, from small and medium sized enterprises based in Australia, employing Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7725"> workers&mdash;will disappear. Telstra will, like other communications companies, source many of their products from overseas. That will not only compound our already disastrous balance of trade problems in the IT and telecommunications area but also severely undermine local domestic industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister made this discovery after he had slashed the research and development concession in the previous budget. It was 150 per cent; it is now 125 per cent. What impact do you think that would have, Mr Deputy Speaker, in IT areas and in the sunrise industries in this country? It would have a very disastrous impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At its recent prize-giving ceremony, the Institution of Engineers&mdash;which, again, the Prime Minister was unable to attend but which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was able to attend&mdash;indicated very significantly that syndication had played an important role in ensuring that some of the more innovative ideas to emerge from our engineering community in recent times had been able to be put into commercial form, that the `D' part of research and development was able to be brought to fruition, and syndication was an important part of that. Any elements of concern about taxation policy on syndication could have been addressed and the good parts of that policy retained, but no. Prior to making his discovery about the value of IT, the Prime Minister had already slashed the research and development concession, had already abolished syndication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So whether we look at the traditional industries in Australia&mdash;the agricultural industries, the manufacturing industries&mdash;or whether we look at the sunrise industries involving information technology and associated computer and telecommunications equipment, both of which feature in this legislation, we see that on both counts the Howard government has failed to deliver an industry policy which will respond adequately to the needs of companies in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world has got its act together. Unlike this government, the world is very quick to move on areas of electronic commerce. The free trade agreement in information technology, which this legislation will help to put in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> place as part of that global package, ensures that there will be no tariff barriers to IT computer equipment and computer software and a number of related items. That, of course, will promote the growth in information technology throughout the world. It will promote the growth of electronic commerce. It will promote the growth of the service economy, the digital age economy, which is now upon us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not wake up one morning and discover that the whole of the world has gone digital. That is not the way it works. In the information technology revolution, these things do not occur overnight; they occur on a gradual but inexorable basis. If this country is not part of that gradual revolution, our children will wake up one morning and discover that the world has moved on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, this government comes very late to discovering the importance of information technology and the way in which that can be integrated into our economy to make the whole economy more productive. We should gain not only from the production of the boxes of the computer equipment itself&mdash;although that is important and should not be understated&mdash;but from the significance of computerisation and the significance of IT, the way in which it can energise our whole economy. That is the significance of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has recently received any number of reports which touch on these areas. We have had the Mortimer report, the Goldsworthy report and the recent Cutler report on the information technology commonwealth. We have had all of those reports&mdash;indeed, this government is drowning in reports&mdash;but what we are not seeing is action in these areas. Goldsworthy had to spend several chapters just giving the government a conducted tour of the IT world because I am sure, like me, he was well aware of the fact that this government has a very poor understanding of the benefits of information technology and the advantages which it can bring to the productivity of our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We expect to see some action in those areas. We would like to see this government seize the opportunity that the free trade agreement provides and ensure, through a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7726"> coordinated industry policy and through a coordinated purchasing policy, that it does advantage rather than disadvantage our domestic industry in these areas. Electronic commerce and IT have an enormous contribution to make to Australia's economy and to the global economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The global impact will occur whether we want it to or not. That reality is here and now. The important thing is: will Australia be able to seize that opportunity; will Australia's government ensure that we are in a position to be part of the global revolution&mdash;to be part of the electronic age and to have the advantages and the productivity gains which electronic commerce will bring&mdash;which is taking place even now. Those issues are very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To date, we have only seen a negative response from this government: a removing of concessions, a slashing of programs and a withdrawal of support. In the traditional industries, again, we have seen a slashing of tariffs&mdash;a mindless drive to zero. Contrary to what the Prime Minister said, it is not `nothing for nothing'; in this case, we are giving everything and gaining very little in return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly support the move towards free trade in information technology. That is one aspect of this legislation which the opposition can strongly support. We oppose the changes in sugar, particularly on the basis that this whole debate has been conducted in the absence of an industry policy. That is the failure of this government. It is a failure which this bill epitomises and one which the opposition will continue to point out to the public.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address a few remarks to this important question of tariffs in the sugar industry and the dairy industry in relation to competitive exports. I make the point that the dairy industry is similar to the sugar industry in that the dairy farmers need a factory to process their product and also, like the sugar farmers, they had an inward&hyphen;looking, insular approach where they enjoyed the benefit of fresh milk prices in the domestic markets. They enjoyed a tariff of their own in the way in which they produced the milk, sold it at a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> premium price on the domestic city markets and then did not care too much about the export markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar situation existed in the sugar industry, which was highly organised with entitlements being allocated to farms and to paddocks and with the mill being attached to the farmers' productive enterprise. On that basis, the sugar industry like the dairy industry developed a protective attitude that Australian consumers should assist the sugar industry in its profitability and in a form of protection. This debate here tonight is the end of the line in that whole argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the government's decision to finally remove the sugar tariff. It is quite appropriate in the current debate about the TCF and car industries, which members would be aware I have had more than a passing interest in. The dairy industry gave a lead to these debates with the Kerin plan. I place on record my admiration for the Kerin plan, where the dairy industry changed its emphasis from having a domestic orientation providing city milk to becoming an exporter of excellence both in terms of price received and in the quality products it exported, especially to the Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that the sugar industry can follow its example. Once the sugar tariffs are removed, the sugar industry will be focused on providing export quality products to all those nations around the world and on being able to compete with some of those nations which have their products subsidised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would refute a couple of the remarks made by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) who was observing that the government had changed their position. It is surprising that he is not in the House. It is the first time during the tariff debate that he is not actually here, but he is late as usual. The important thing that the member for Corio and members opposite should understand is that, whilst in opposition, the government did agree to retain the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A meeting was held with the sugar industry&mdash;and they are difficult people&mdash;and I recall the minister at the table, the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), having long discussions with the sugar industry on this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7727"> whole tariff debate. The minister at the table is well known for his views on the tariff debate. On the 74 recommendations, Harry Bonanno, who is a legendary figure in the sugar industry, agreed that the tariffs should be removed. It was quite clear. The task force agreed with a number of other recommendations&mdash;that single desk selling remain, that pooling remain and that the industry itself get an export focus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody could argue with that. The change was made so that the gradual reduction in tariffs down to $55 a tonne, which was introduced by the Labor Party, would finally be removed. I am sure that the shadow minister at the table, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), would agree with it in his heart of hearts. So that has been agreed to. One of my colleagues, the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), has been arguing some case that I do not personally agree with, that in the longer run this government does not agree with and that the former Labor government did not agree with because they were for free trade and for an opening up of world trade positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I will keep my remarks fairly precise. Could I just say that, in the current debates about the TCF industries, the car industry and the sugar industry, Australia is moving towards a liberal trade position. If you look at the figures, the average tariff on manufactured goods in the 1940s was about 40 per cent and it has now moved down to about four per cent around the world. That puts a lie to the myth that other countries are using high protective barriers to keep Australian goods out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even China, which has often been quoted in this debate, has announced that by the year 2000 its average tariff will fall from 23 per cent to 15 per cent. The other countries which often get mentioned in both the TCF debate and the car debate&mdash;Thailand, Indonesia, Korea, the European Union, Malaysia, the USA, New Zealand, Japan and Singapore&mdash;have all substantially reduced their tariff barriers. By the year 2008 those countries will be in the World Trade Organisation and will have their tariff barriers very much lower. Australia needs to follow the lead, particularly in the symbolic sugar tariff. However, it does 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not really matter because, as all members of this House would be aware, sugar producers export 85 per cent of their production and even more is predicted to be on the export market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude my remarks by quoting an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that has the headline `TCF tariff row rages as IC report imminent'. The correspondent talks about some of the TCF arguments and the current sugar debate. The Executive Director of the NFF, Ms Wendy Craik, summarises the debate in the TCF industries, the car industry and in the sugar industry. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The executive director of the NFF, Ms Wendy Craik, warned yesterday that a tariff pause would "send very dangerous signals to our trading partners in APEC and the Cairns groups".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Any wimping on continuous reductions would give our trading partners the ability to identify their special case, which in all likelihood would be agriculture," Ms Craik said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The principle of reciprocal trade balancing has gained a worrying level of acceptance. Reciprocity ignores the benefits that arise from domestic trade liberalisation," she said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Tariffs don't save jobs. Tariffs cost jobs. The jobs are lost in other industries and in other places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The costs in terms of jobs lost are hidden, they are diffused and they are spread widely across the rest of the economy and in future generations . . . TCF jobs are visible jobs, but the lost opportunities for other jobs are invisible," she said.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I rest my case on the remarks of the NFF, which is well known for its very strong advocacy of the free trade position on behalf of its members and on behalf of all Australians. We need to ensure that we obey the rules of the World Trade Organisation so living standards in Australia will improve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of the sugar tariff is a symbol of Australia's commitment to a freer and a more liberal trade regime. Those members opposite were part of a government that set that in train and tonight they are opposing the proposition of removing the $55 per tonne tariff. I ask what their position was. They have now changed so dramatically on the three important aspects of their policy that they had in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly support the government's position in the whole tariff debate. I regard the remov 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7728"> al of the sugar tariff as a very important symbol of the sugar industry in Queensland and northern New South Wales&mdash;an industry which historically has always had an inward focus&mdash;having a dramatic change of heart, a change of their commitment to a freer, more liberalised trading position.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened to the debate with great interest, as have most members, if not all, throughout the different nooks and crannies of this Parliament House. There were so many different points made, particularly in relation to the removal of the duty on sugar, which I will come to in a moment. Beforehand, I would like to stress another major feature of the bill before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind members that, in respect of the information technology agreement, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) signed the ministerial declaration on trade in information technology products on behalf of Australia in Singapore in December last. It represents a package of sectoral liberalisation which, in combination with the agreement on basic telecommunications, establishes a trading framework which will underpin the continuing rapid growth of global information and communications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement seeks the elimination of tariffs on technology and telecommunications products by the year 2000. During the negotiations the Deputy Prime Minister made clear his requirements for an acceptable and balanced package of liberalisation being achieved and for the participation by a core of our regional trading partners. We ensured that the emerging Asian markets participated in the agreement and that their participation was on a similar basis to that of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia stands to gain substantially from the signing of this agreement. The agreement 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will provide Australian industry with an increased number of export opportunities so as to help redress the almost $7 billion trade deficit in this sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to sugar, which preoccupied most of the contributors to the debate. It hardly needs to be said that sugar is a great and successful Australian industry. The fundamental issue for the industry, like all others, is the long-term competitiveness and sustainability. The sugar industry working party examined this issue at length regarding the duty, including a long process of public discussions, submissions and hearings. That working party concluded that changes were necessary to ensure the success of the industry into the future and, therefore, recommended an integrated package of arrangements for this very purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations included: unanimous support from all members, including industry leaders; focus on the export orientation of the industry, which is in excess of 85 per cent of production, rather than arrangements which concentrate on the domestic side of the industry; and the export of refined sugar manufactured products such as sugar as an input.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the tariff, as recognised in the debate, the effects have been negated by the adoption since 1 July this year of export parity pricing by the Queensland Sugar Corporation. This has been of benefit to the industry through the relief of economic pressures on the Australian refining industry, which has since been given the assurance by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that it will not intervene in the proposed joint venture between the Australian sugar refining businesses of CSR Ltd and Mackay Refined Sugars Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make the point in this respect that the export orientation of the industry under the export parity pricing arrangement, which has been in place since 1 July, is consistent with Australia's position as the most competitive international producer of sugar and will mean, in addition to that capacity to compete internationally, the lowest cost domestic sugar, which underscores the obvious unattractiveness of the Australian market to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7729"> foreign producers. We should remember that the level of imports of raw sugar into Australia in the 1995-96 financial year was only 762 tonnes and the tariff revenue on that sugar was a total of $772.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a wide&hyphen;ranging debate in recent days during the second reading stage of the bill. Given that exposure, I now commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most recent crisis facing local industries and local jobs is, of course,  the removal of tariffs for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. On Monday I was one of a number of Labor Party MPs who presented thousands of signatures to the parliament on petitions protesting against the government's plans to cut those tariffs, plans which would have spelt the end of most of our local TCF jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, in the parliament, we have been visited by mayors from municipalities in areas that are likely to suffer from cuts to TCF tariffs. They are involved in the Victorian local government campaign for TCF jobs and include the Mayor of the Banyule City Council, which is in Jagajaga. The petitions have been signed and the mayors have travelled to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Canberra because, unlike this government, many thousands of Australians, and certainly people in Jagajaga, believe that tariff cuts to TCF industries would cost tens of thousands of jobs as local manufacturers react by shutting down or moving offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another critical issue for a successful trade policy that I wanted to raise tonight is to have an industry policy that actually encourages and assists local industries to grow and create jobs for local people. A good local example is the West Heidelberg firm of Henderson McPherson. This company has been in existence for over 70 years and is the main Australian producer of jigsaw puzzles and high grade board games. They also produce wall planners and packaging. Recently they embarked on a venture to export a unique version of Australian designed ultra&hyphen;modern jigsaw puzzles to the rest of the world. Henderson McPherson actually set a world record for the production of updated Trivial Pursuit board games, being able to turn around a new version of Trivial Pursuit in six weeks when the average for other producers of the game in other countries was around 10 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The company has always tried to produce quality products with the utmost efficiency. Their main competitors are in New Zealand and Malaysia. Both competitors operate in a lower wage environment than Australia. This means that Henderson McPherson must operate more efficiently, using the latest in high&hyphen;tech equipment and with a highly skilled work force, to compete. Significantly, the management of Henderson McPherson have also acknowledged to me that they understand the importance of a reasonable level of wages guaranteeing a reasonable level of income for their workers as part of the equation which provides a local market for their products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they are hampered in their endeavours by a federal government that shows little interest in their problems. There is real suspicion that many of their competitors are dumping in Australia at a price below the actual cost of manufacture. There is also concern that a large amount of competition product is actual pirated material which is produced illegally in other countries. At the same time they see one of the mainstays of their busi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7731"> ness&mdash;producing games under licence for the local distributor of the American toy company, Mattel&mdash;being threatened by this government's proposals to allow parallel importing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parallel importing is too complicated an issue for this presentation, but advocates of parallel importing claim that it levels the playing field by removing restrictions to trade. The problem with this argument is that the restrictions referred to are intellectual property conventions and laws of copyright that underpin the operation of a large proportion of world commerce. Trade in properties incorporating intellectual property is the major growth industry that will lead us into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea that this government might remove protection in this way is something that we would certainly not want to see happen. Allowing parallel importing would remove the core business that has allowed Henderson McPherson to employ 80 people in Jagajaga. It would be a major disincentive to the company in its risky, but potentially very valuable for Australia, export endeavours.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7731"><TITLE>Diana, Princess of Wales</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We were all greatly saddened by the news of the death of the Princess of Wales, her companion Dodi Al&hyphen;Fayed and their driver last Sunday. It is still a shock to many of us and, indeed, many worldwide that we have lost a courageous, unique and caring woman whom the world loved. Princess Diana has been a part of all of our lives. My heart goes out to her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, who still must be in a state of shock and grief while they mourn the loss of their mother.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During her life Princess Diana championed many charitable causes and was genuinely interested in improving life for the poor and the sick. She was held in very high esteem by the people she worked with on important national and international projects. Princess Diana had most recently championed the cause for the banning of all landmines after she had seen the terrible effect these devices had on the innocent men, women and children who had been caught up in war. Her grief for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those who suffered was real and she gave voice to those whose cries for help had been ignored. Our own Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has also championed the banning of landmines worldwide on behalf of the Australian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Princess of Wales showed a great deal of love for the children of the world. She rightly understood that they are our future and that we should be doing everything in our power to help them to live and grow up to be responsible and healthy individuals. Princess Diana was also a person who showed great tolerance and understanding for those who have too often been shunned by society. Her work for the victims of AIDS demonstrated this understanding, as did her work with sufferers of leprosy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a mother of three boys I felt particular empathy with the late Princess during the time of the break&hyphen;up of her marriage. Such times are always very difficult. The difficulties were even greater for Princess Diana because of the circumstances in which she lived. Her eldest son, Prince William, will one day be King. Neither he nor his brother, Prince Harry, will ever live normal lives as we know life to be. Their lives will be under constant scrutiny by the press and we have expectations on how they should behave, and they have now suffered the loss of their much loved mother.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can only imagine how inconsolable their grief must be. When they appeared in public with their mother, their mutual love was clear for all to see. Princess Diana was very close to both of the boys. How utterly tragic it is that she will never see them grow up to be men. How hard it will be for them to have lost their mother at this time in such tragic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like many of us, the princes will have their memories of the times they shared with their mother. We remember her visits to Australia and the good work she did whilst here. We remember her kind words, her friendly smile, her warmth and her ability to reach out to all people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the people of my electorate of Makin, I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends of Princess Diana, Dodi Al&hyphen;Fayed and their driver. Our thoughts and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7732"> prayers are with the royal family at this time of grief and mourning, especially to Princess Diana's sons, Prince William and Prince Harry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to be very parochial, as I normally am, and talk about the Tuggeranong Football Club&mdash;that is, the Tuggeranong Aussie Rules Football Club. Tuggeranong Football Club is a team competitor in the ACTAFL competition. For those not local, ACTAFL is the quick name for the ACT Australian Football League. This team of young players, the committee, the workers and the supporters can be an inspiration to all of us, particularly here in Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Sunday I had the pleasure to go and watch this team win the ACTAFL Preliminary Final, earning a berth in this coming weekend's Grand Final. It is no mean feat getting into a grand final in any competition, but this particular feat is really worth looking at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not that long ago&mdash;in fact only five years back&mdash;the Tuggeranong ACTAFL team was consistently beaten each week by scores almost worthy of a Bradman batting innings. It was even looking possible that they could no longer maintain a position in the ACTAFL first grade competition. However, we had huge numbers of juniors playing in the Tuggeranong Valley and very good individual players were nurtured through those ranks. Of course, too many people enjoyed their football to let that actually happen. A community effort was called for and with a lot of hard work, determination and dedication the club was reborn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the team that played on Sunday, 25 players are listed in the fixture and 18 of them have come through from the Tuggeranong junior football ranks. That is in no way taking away from the other seven, but it is certainly emphasising the strength of the sport within my community. Four of our Tuggeranong ex-juniors are now playing first grade AFL&mdash;Hamill and Anstey with Carlton, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Blumfield with Essendon and Howman with Hawthorn. I do not mind that none of them happen to be playing with my team in the first grade AFL; I am just pleased to see that they have reached that level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This coming weekend three Tuggeranong teams are playing in grand finals&mdash;the Canberra District Finals second division, the under 21s Colts, as well as the first grade team to which I have referred. Every one of the players, the trainers, the runners, the volunteers, the committee members, the stalwart supporters and, of course, the sponsors should feel extremely proud of this effort. The club's finances are low. A small budget is what they work on, but the determination is very high indeed. The sponsors over the past five years deserve a lot of praise, particularly the sponsors who have been with the club this year and last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coach, Geoff Bartley, has given so much for so little. To everyone involved in the club and particularly in this team&mdash;Bill Miller, the club president; Geoff Bartley, the coach; Luke Jess, the captain; Sue Birks, the secretary; Canvas Kearney, the local character of the club; Bob Hughes, who is the runner each week out there on the ground; all the sponsors; the two youngest players listed last week who are only 17, Scott Montgomery and Shaun Whitby; the Honey Brothers, who joined us this year; and Ricci Miller&mdash;thank you from a community that also happens to be struggling through tough times. I wish I could have named them all&mdash;the list is absolutely endless&mdash;but obviously I cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you can get this far in difficult circumstances as the Tuggeranong Football Club has done, the whole community could learn what a bit of absolute determination and dedication against tough circumstances can produce. It will be a pleasure to go along on Sunday and watch this grand final. Win, lose or draw, the Tuggeranong community is incredibly proud of the effort that has gone into this club and into this team. On behalf of the community, thank you to them and all power to them on Sunday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to bring to the urgent attention of the House a serious situation facing the Federated Clerks Union in Townsville and its secretary, Jim O'Donnell. The issue relates to the failure of the union to account for its operations over several years as required by the Workplace Relations Act. News reports of the union's position broadcast on the local radio station today by journalist John Camplin have brought a sinister response. Staff of the radio station have been subjected to standover tactics when they have simply been doing their job as a community watchdog.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that a senior union official of the FCU threatened a senior member of the radio station staff just because they are doing this job. This is unAustralian and will be most concerning as the secretary of the union has put his name forward to be the ALP candidate for the state seat of Mundingburra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This incident today is just another page in the sorry events within the Labor Party in Townsville. The city has been rocked with shock after shock&mdash;electoral roll details being altered for political purposes without the knowledge of the elector, dead persons voting in ALP plebiscites for the last four years, persons carrying out criminal activity for political purposes and being offered seats on the council in return, ALP members voting without ever having received a ballot paper, ALP memberships paid by candidates in return for getting their ballot papers, branch stacking on a grand scale&mdash;and so it goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decent, long time ordinary supporters of the ALP must be horrified that a few with personal ambitions can so rort their party's system. In relation to the failure of this ALP candidate to lodge financial documents, yesterday I had confirmed with the Australian Industrial Registry that the union has not lodged its financial documents of the branch for the years 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996. A formal investigation should be requested. These documents are required by law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I rise to join with 23 urban and regional mayors of Victoria who are currently in this place promoting their cause for the rescinding of the Productivity Commission's view on tariff reform. Those 23 mayors cover some 2.5 million constituents, all of whom, I am sure, would join with the mayors, many in this House and me to ask that the government look to reject its so&hyphen;called initiatives to date in this regard. As Victorians, these mayors know how our state has particularly suffered and will suffer at the hands of these reforms. The clothing, textile and footwear industries are at the forefront in regard to the decline of our manufacturing industry, particularly in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I suspect that most members would appreciate and accept that our industrial base does have to adapt to changing international circumstances, and that our future does perhaps lie in such new industries as communications, information technology and food processing, the Industry Commission's striving for ideological purity, which we have seen first through its report on the automotive industry and now on the TCF industry, is ill&hyphen;founded and has great potential detriment to reap upon the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) and I recently visited the Bekaert (Australia) textile works in Lyndhurst, within the electorate of Isaacs, to discuss with it the Industry Commission's recommendations to reduce tariffs in the textile, clothing and footwear industries. These tariff reductions would destroy the local industries and many local jobs, and are opposed by a broad coalition, including the opposition and local manufacturers such as Bekaert.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This company employs some 120 people from the Dandenong and Cranbourne areas. It is the leading Australian  company operating in the specialised field of jacquard weaving, producing a range of damask fabrics, including mattress ticking, upholstery fabrics, curtain fabrics, bed and table linen, vertical blinds and much more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that day we both saw the capabilities which may be lost to Australia if the Industry Commission's report, which Bekaert believed to be deeply flawed in its method and conclusions, is allowed to go unchallenged. This company is planning to set up investments of up to $10 million between now and the year 2000 and to expand its facilities and further increase its employment. However, it has placed its expansion on hold until the future of the industry is determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission recommends tariff cuts to the industry to between 11 per cent and 8.5 per cent by 2005, and to five per cent by 2008, regardless of what Australia's competitors do. If the federal government were to follow these recommendations, it would not only destroy the industry but also put at risk the jobs of more than 4,800 workers from Melbourne's outer south&hyphen;eastern region employed in the TCF areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as the tariff cuts to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, the commission has recommended the import credit scheme be abandoned in the year 2000. Since it was introduced in 1991, Australia's exports of textiles, clothing and footwear have more than doubled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the shadow minister for industry, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), has made clear, the opposition would be working with the industry to gain firm commitments not just to secure existing levels of employment but to create new jobs, new levels of investment and increased exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor would look at a pause in tariff reductions from 2000 to 2005 when the international agreement on textiles clothing&hyphen;multifibre arrangement liberalisation is scheduled to be completed; retention of the import credit scheme or an  equivalent; a review of future assistance arrangements in 2004, taking account of progress on trade liberalisation

I join with our local mayors, Greg Harris from Dandenong, Bill Nixon from Kingston and Wayne Smith from Casey, in urging the government to rethink its position in this regard. Indeed, in that matter I am happy also to join with the Senate and other speakers in this place to oppose the Industry Commission's recommendations.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7735"><TITLE>Public Funds for Political Purposes</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe the general public has always had an idea that there are two sets of rules operating in society: one for politicians and one for the rest of the community. It is something most politicians would disagree with and a myth which I work hard in my electorate to dispel, as do many other elected members in this House on all sides of the political fence.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Yet there are times when issues arise which make even the most trusting and naive constituent&mdash;and politician I might add&mdash;query the level playing field of our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such an example arose recently, and it is not only one which affects my electorate of Gilmore or the state of New South Wales but also one that all politicians and community representatives must think twice about, and that is the allocation of public funds for political purposes. I refer of course to the recent publicity surrounding a tour of the western New South Wales region by the federal member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While not wishing to comment on what was said or protested about during this much publicised tour, one fact caught my attention and that of the people in my electorate. There were 60 New South Wales police allocated to escort the federal member on her tour. This does not include the bomb squad and up to 20 federal police officers who also followed the media and protest circus during its tour. That makes more than 80 police officers protecting one politician.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This sort of police allocation comes at an interesting time for New South Wales country residents. It comes at a time when state, territory and federal crime rates are continuing to increase, at a time when the people of the Gilmore electorate are facing a greater chance of being burgled in their homes, and at a time when vandalism, assault and drug charges are on the increase; and at a time when the New South Wales government is considering cutting back the numbers of police in rural areas. This is in marked contrast to the police presence given one politician during a media stunt in the western region of that same state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Gilmore, police recently formed a target arrest group, which focused on property crime, something which has risen dramatically in the region over the past few years. This has resulted in tens of thousands of dollars of stolen property being recovered and returned to its rightful owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While concentrating on property theft, TAG has also arrested criminals wanted for a range of drug and assault offences, thus having an even greater impact on the safety of Gilmore residents and their families. These are the sorts of results the community in Gilmore likes to see from its police, and I commend the local force for the introduction and success of the group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, these are also the sorts of examples rural residents hold up as arguments for an increased police presence in regional areas. I am aware that this is a state issue. However, my constituents do not and cannot see the fairness of a government which allocates 60 state police officers to protecting one politician when they cannot safely walk the streets at night and are forced to live behind locked doors and windows, too afraid to come out, particularly the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community is asking why there are double standards for politicians. The community wants to know how government can justify cutbacks in an area which is vital for community protection while increasing the allocation of the same services to one of their own. The community wants to know why programs with proven results in protection are being threatened by these proposed cuts and why there is no corresponding cut in services

I am, through this means, imploring the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to take note of the signatures on that petition and the views behind it.

The particular reason is that in November 1985, during the time of Victoria's 150th celebration, she and her then husband, the Prince of Wales, visited Gisborne in my electorate to meet with people who were still recovering from the ravages of the Ash Wednesday bushfire. Their visit meant an enormous amount to my constituents at that time. I have had a number of calls suggesting that it would be terrific if I did convey something on behalf of my constituency.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to comment briefly on the remarks made by the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) when he criticised this government for closing a number of Medicare offices across the nation. It should be recognised that this is not a cost saving measure; indeed, the government has opened Medicare agencies situated in pharmacies. So there will be very much greater access by people throughout the country to the facilities of Medicare than previously existed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be recognised as well that, in the time since Medicare and its predecessor, Medibank, were set up, there have been substantial changes in the way in which people access the medical benefits system of this country. In the past, most medical practitioners used to bill their patients and their patients would then make a claim at the local Medicare office. In many areas, the medical practitioners overwhelmingly bulk&hyphen;bill the Health Insurance Commission. Consequently, there has not been a need for local Medicare offices in all situations&mdash;as, indeed, there may well have been in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has decided to maintain Medicare offices in most places throughout the country. The electorate of Fisher did not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7737"> lose any Medicare offices, although two were suggested for closure. But the government decided that those people in rural and regional areas who were more removed from Medicare offices ought to have a facility to deal electronically with the Health Insurance Commission, and so the government placed Medicare agencies in pharmacies. Rather than cutting away at Medicare, rather than reducing access to Medicare, this government, and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in particular, ought to be congratulated because the government has brought Medicare within the geographic reach of a very much greater proportion of the citizens of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not expect to be talking on that particular topic when I rose to speak in the adjournment debate tonight. Like most of us, I read the Sunday newspapers. I must say I was absolutely appalled at the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> of Sunday, 31 August when I saw the words `Water rats&mdash;It's war on our $87,000 wharfies'. This government has reformed the industrial relations system. We have tried to make this country more competitive. Successive governments have endeavoured to make it easier for people to export. But there was one decidedly obvious failure of the former Labor government, and that was the lack of any commitment to reform the Australian waterfront. We only have to look at the lack of performance of the Australian waterfront compared with the waterfronts in Rotterdam, Singapore and many other places to realise that much needs to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This article by Fia Cumming in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> exposed many of the rorts which are currently making our waterfront so uncompetitive. It is interesting to note that the average weekly wage at Port Botany is almost $87,000 a year for a maximum 31&hyphen;hour week and just 175.5 work days annually. In some other ports workers earn up to $124,000 a year. Perks include five weeks holidays, plus 10 weeks sick leave, four days long service leave and&mdash;can you believe it?&mdash;idle time of 35 days a year. They have a system called the `The Nick'. Under `The Nick' system, many wharfies clock on and then clock off just a few hours later.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Banking allowances can add an extra $5,000 per year to the average wage. Port companies estimate that when walking time to and from the mealroom is included, their workers are on duty for just 28.9 hours per week. Sunday penalty rates are 2&half; times the base rate for the first 7.4 hours and 3.5 times the base rate for other hours.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on a vision for Australia, especially with respect to information technology. However, given the announcement today of the EIS for Sydney's second airport, I must convey to the House the disappointment of hundreds of my constituents who are opposed to the airport at Badgerys Creek. I wish to give them the reassurance that I will represent their concerns in this place and ensure that the cabinet and bureaucrats who made this executive decision are aware of the issues that they have raised with me. I will ensure where possible that those concerns are addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major infrastructure project like an airport does not happen without environmental impacts but there are also good things, as I would like to point out. The member for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7738"> Chifley (Mr Price) is quoted as saying, on 21 April 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An international airport in this area would create countless opportunities for the area's people and businesses.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He also said, on 5 May 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister Brereton has at last broken with the FAC monopoly which was strangling the development of an international airport at Badgerys Creek. The airport will be providing the people of western Sydney with the services and facilities that they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, Laurie Brereton, stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  of 8 February 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a local member near Kingsford&hyphen;Smith Airport, my greatest fear is that, without the development of Badgerys Creek as an alternative to provide curfew&hyphen;free access so that Sydney has an airport that can operate 24&hyphen;hours a day, it is inevitable . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Laurie Brereton also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The airport at Badgerys Creek will provide a major boost to the economy of the western Sydney region as well as make a valuable contribution to Australia's aviation and tourism industries. The construction phase of the airport provides significant employment opportunities and more jobs will be created as commercial enterprises are attracted to the airport and the surrounding area.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I could go on and on. Penrith City Council, Faye Lo Po, Di Beamer, WSROC with Maggie Deahm, Jim Anderson&mdash;a number of MPs in the outer greater western Sydney area under Labor have quite supported the airport at Badgerys Creek for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it outrageous that Bob Carr made a statement today; with political expediency, he is seeking political gain out of the distress of hundreds of my constituents. I think the transparency of his political playing is quite obvious and will not be lost on the constituents of western Sydney, who have listened to Labor MPs in the west for several years now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given this vision for Australia and given that unemployment is the major issue in my area, I need to reiterate what this government has done to address that feeling of unfulfilled potential, of stagnation and lost opportunity, that the people in my electorate have felt after 13 years under Labor. They feel that we have not lived up to our potential here in Australia and they are seeking some relief.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been following with interest a number of recent reports in the IT debate. One that has come up recently is that of the Information Policy Advisory Council, relating to a national policy framework for structural adjustment of information within the Commonwealth. It is a most important document which looks at how we do business as a government, how we can do it cheaper with IT and how we can integrate various Commonwealth agencies so that they are interoperable, as well as building measures to cut out waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am keen to see measures in the Goldsworthy report, in the Mortimer reviews and also in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Make or break</EMPHASIS> from the MTIA being brought together by this government with a vision for a way to go ahead, in order to compete with Malaysia, India and the United States in terms of building, here in Australia, mighty enterprises that will carry us into the next century. I refer especially to the future of our kids. Where they are going to be employed is one of the major issues in my electorate. Unless we continue to address these issues, battling Australians, the working poor of my area, will continue to feel that Australia is not the lucky country, but a place that has missed opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know they are with me 100 per cent as we stand here and battle to get some of those industries up and started in my electorate. We are looking at a whole framework within government, which has taken some time to unravel from the past 13 years, in order to devise some policy structure in which this can all be brought forward.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the House on 5 December last year, I responded to a statement by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) at the tabling of the government's response to the recommendations of the aviation safety inquiry report. In his response and statement, the minister said that he planned to give a further reference to the committee's successor, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform, in the coming year. That has not occurred. There has been no further reference. I ask the minister: when will he give that further reference to the committee? I express my serious disappointment at the failure of the government to respond to the recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe </EMPHASIS> report. He responded in words, but not with action. There were  many expectations raised in the recommendations of that report but they have not been carried out in practice. I will go through them one by one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major recommendation of the committee's report was that there would be a publication on a monthly basis of serious safety deficiencies identified in charter aircraft. Those reports have not been published despite the government's response of 5 December 1996 which stated that the report would be published monthly and that the first serious deficiency report would be published to cover the calendar month of January 1997. It is now September 1997. The first report is yet to be published. We had anticipated that the first report would be published in March 1996. The change in government altered that. It has taken the new government nine months to respond to recommendations that had already been responded to by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Added to that we now get into September 1997 and still there is no publication of any serious safety deficiency report in respect of charter aircraft. This is the most serious area of poor administration and performance in the whole aviation system. It is quite clear here that the industry and some of the players within the industry have managed to forestall the publication of this information. When we made a recommendation in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report in December 1992 that information should be published on the owners of ships that were detained, the nature of the deficiency of the ship, the reasons for unseaworthiness, the charterers and all parties associated with that vessel, there were cries of heresy and alarm and claims about the damage it would do to the industry all around the world. Those reports are now published on a monthly basis across the world. Other countries, such as some in Europe, as well as the European Commission and the United States Coastguard, publish much more extensive sets of information on those ships than we originally recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly I deplore the failure of the government to publish that information on aviation. That is the immediate discipline that is available to the community so people can know which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7742"> firms are not meeting aviation safety requirements. It seems to me that since the change in government, despite all the rhetoric about aviation safety, the lid has been slammed shut on information being available to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same speech the minister referred to the code of conduct in relation to the domestic code&hyphen;share flights, and the fact that tickets from Qantas and Ansett would incorporate printed information advising of a code&hyphen;share service being operated and giving the name of the carrier operating the service. All other tickets being issued by travel agents would have a sticker advising the consumer if it was a code&hyphen;share flight. That has not occurred. That information is not being provided to the public. It ought to be provided. The public are entitled to know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 41 million passengers who travel by air in Australian airspace each year. Those people are entitled to know. Now we see a move by Airservices Australia, supported by certain vested interests, to change arrangements in respect of airspace where, it is said, there is a $20 million per year saving to be made by changing the existing arrangements. And we see the professionals in aviation, the pilots who are flying regular public transport aircraft, opposing the proposal in respect of class E airspace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of those arrangements is one cent per week per passenger. This passenger is very happy to see that paid to ensure that those arrangements in respect of class E airspace continue. But it is another example of how certain vested interests in this country are not allowing activities and discipline to take place that should occur in respect of aviation safety .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go then to my questions, numbers 1093, 1094 and 1095 to the minister on 12 December 1996, when I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is he able to give an assurance that individual Qantas domestic aircraft are not operating on continuing scheduled flights each month with a higher number of safety defects than 1994?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Question number 1093 asked a similar question in respect of Ansett, and question 1095 asked another similar question in respect of any other activities. On February 1997 I received answers to those questions. They came back with the same answer which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has advised that the Authority can not supply details of the relative number of defects which may be carried on individual Ansett aircraft. To determine the number of such defects would require an examination and subsequent assessment of every entry made in each aircraft's technical log book since 1993. CASA does not have the resources to carry out such an examination without severely compromising its ability to perform its regular surveillance functions.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is nonsense, Mr Deputy Speaker. The information I sought is carried on the maintenance release sheets of those aircraft. The airlines themselves have that information. They need to have that information on a regular basis&mdash;flight by flight, day by day, week by week, month by month&mdash;to supervise the safe operation of their own aircraft. That information is available. All that is happening here is `bang' the lid has slammed shut. They do not want that information to get out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Passengers are entitled to that information to make good decisions about whom they want to travel with. It is an immediate discipline upon operators to ensure they are doing the right thing. I would not have asked those questions if I had not had reason to ask them, and the reason I had to ask them was that information had been provided to me that there had been a change on the part of airline managements to allow a higher number of safety related defects to go unrepaired in the operation of commercial aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of quite legitimate things that you can do. There is what we call minimum equipment listing. The answer that came back from the minister could have said, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7743"> `We will do some part of it,' or, `There is a minimum equipment listing that could have explained some nature of it.' Some information could have been provided without any difficulty at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But remember, this is not coming from the authority. This is not the Civil Aviation Safety Authority that signs off on these answers. The minister of the Crown signs off on these answers. This is a government answer, not an authority answer. The authority prepares the information, but it is the government that signs off. So that lid has slammed shut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get around that, I went back to the minister with a similar question in February of this year. But I thought, `I will confine it to just one month and they can't say they haven't got the resources for one month.' I asked the same question with respect to December 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How many (a) written and (b) other expressions of concern about the safe operation of air services did his Department or any other agency for which he is responsible receive in December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Back came the answer six months later. Note the time. It took six months to get this paltry answer from information that was readily available. The answer stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1996, BASI received a total of five written reports via its Confidential Aviation Incident Reporting system; CASA received 6 written expressions of concern; and Airservices received 128 written reports of concern.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is for one month only. The information is readily categorised, but I draw the attention of honourable members to the nature of the complaints in that answer. That is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All five written reports received by BASI . . . were related to regular public transport (RPT) operations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The RPT carry the 41 million passengers per year that I referred to a few minutes ago. One of the complaints was the:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . failure by pilots of non&hyphen;passenger carrying flights to respond to RPT  aircraft transmissions in mandatory broadcast zones&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This goes to the safe operation of air space because, when it was mandatory for another aircraft to respond to an RPT aircraft transmission, it did not happen. But we would not have been told that if we had not pursued the questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second complaint was about the safe stowage of walking sticks in aircraft cabins. That could have been about staff. The third was about checking fuel quantity. That is important. The fifth one was an:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . allegation of substitution of Class B aircraft*&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which are non&hyphen;RPT aircraft that operate at a lower set of safety standards than regular public transport aircraft&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for Class A aircraft* to operate RPT services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is exactly what happened in the Seaview Air disaster. Aircraft that were not certificated to operate as regular public transport aircraft&mdash;they were class B charter aircraft with a lower set of standards&mdash;were substituted to perform the task of class A aircraft. That was the fifth complaint that came out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there were the six written reports of concern that were made to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. What was the first one? It was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allegation of substitution of Class B aircraft* for Class A aircraft*</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The second:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation for a special audit of an operator 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7744">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The third:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Low flying aircraft over Cable Beach, WA</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was for charter aircraft. The fourth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Operator maintenance and flight crew duty times</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was also for charter aircraft. The fifth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upper torso restraint requirements for passengers</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was for RPT. The last:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Standard instrument departure, non&hyphen;compliance</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was for high capacity regular public transport aircraft. That is a serious matter. But we had to drag this out&mdash;it is like extracting teeth&mdash;of the minister and the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are the oral expressions of concern. There was an alleged dive bombing of a shopping centre by a charter aircraft. There was a question on the safety of an operator, given the media attention on aviation safety: RPT. A low flying aircraft over Kuranda was RPT. There was an observation that a float plane operating over a populated area was flying the wrong way in an aircraft lane of entry&mdash;that was charter aircraft and regular public transport aircraft&mdash;and then there was a low flying aircraft on approach to Perth Airport. But then the answer goes on to say that there were 128 different reports, mostly from pilots, to Airservices Australia itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am deeply disappointed that that information is not readily available. I am more disappointed, and worried, that the safety deficiency reports have not been published. I call on the minister and the government to ensure that those reports are published as quickly as possible. I will not accept the feeble excuse that there is now some legal obstacle to that&mdash;that there may be some suit for damages or defamation if information were to be published. We went through that questioning and checking process during our committee hearing into the Civil Aviation Safety Authority legislation back in May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questions 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, which I first asked on 26 June and which remain unanswered at this date, all go to asking for specific responses from the minister on what periodic reports have been produced. What has been the substance of each monthly report he has received from the program advisory panel? What reports have been published on safety deficiencies detected by CASA in its normal work? The answer to that is none, but it does not take three months to tell me none. Then the code share flight information: has that been published? No, it has not. I also asked him whether the safety pamphlet he referred to in his speech on 5 December 1996 would be circulated widely. That has not happened, and I still have no answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked for answers and information on each of those matters that came out of his statement and came out of the committee's report. That report, as I said, has had the lid slammed shut on it. There has been a lot of talk. There has been a lot of rhetoric, but the passengers&mdash;those 41 million people who travel in Australian airspace each year&mdash;are entitled to the best level of safety than we can give them. The mechanisms are there, but there is no reportage taking place and the public is not being informed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude with the answer the minister gave me on question 1569, which came back on 5 August 1997, in respect of Robinson R22 helicopters. Again I refuse to accept that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority believes that the use of unapproved or bogus aircraft parts is of virtually nil importance in this country. I do not have time to go into the details of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7745"> answer&mdash;they are there in answer to the question in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;but I refuse to accept that and I will pursue it further.</PARA></SPEECH>

Many members may know that I am a pilot of approximately 1,000 hours experience. I am endorsed on several different aircraft, and I own my own twin&hyphen;engine 310 aircraft, which I have had for approximately eight years. I have got my own maintenance facility, fully approved and registered by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, so I feel that I can talk with some authority, particularly in relation to aviation safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With various committees, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has looked very closely into aviation safety in this country. It is apparent that the aviation industry in this country has been lacking leadership and control for far too long. Aviation inspectors have never had the teeth to be able to deliver safety in this country as it should be delivered. The minister has discussed this in depth in his ministerial statement in relation to the Monarch and the Seaview accidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure inquiry that has now been completed produced the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> report. I must say the committee has done a very good job going into aviation safety and looking at various aspects, but one thing that I could point out is that the aviation industry is unique in its own way. Unless people know the industry very well, they may not know what questions to ask, and the opportunity to ask them probably would not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to have people in the country who are looking closely into aviation safety, then maybe we should have people who are experienced in the industry involved with those committees. I am more than sure that they have seen things that have happened in the past which need to be brought to attention. If those people have never been involved in the industry&mdash;if they have never flown or been closely involved with it&mdash;then I can understand that some of the questions that need to be asked probably would not be asked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the particular problems in past years has been that people have not been game, if that is the right way of putting it, to front the Civil Aviation Safety Authority&mdash;or the then Bureau of Air Safety Investigation&mdash;for it was always seen as being somewhat like the Gestapo. If people had a problem or they were not sure about a particular issue, they were genuinely concerned that if they brought the issue to attention they might find themselves in trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people I know went out of their way, if they saw an incident or if there was something that was not right, to make sure that they kept their mouth shut and their head down; they basically flushed over it. They did not want to draw attention to themselves. The industry under the Labor government, particularly with the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) at the wheel, always appeared as a real mates' industry and, depending on who you were, that might have been be right. That was just a perception, I guess, but it was one  that was out there. Whether it was right or not is for individuals to decide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am more than sure that the industry has had many problems for many years which should have been fixed up a long time ago, but obviously they never have been. The Keating government, and the Labor governments of the previous 13 years, had the opportunity to do something about it. Now we hear Labor talk in a very hairy&hyphen;chested way about the fact that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7746"> this government should be doing something about it. Well, we are. Labor had 13 years of government to get involved and fix the industry and now they are blaming us. Now, 13 months from when all this came about, people are saying we should have done something. They say 13 years for Labor and 13 months for the coalition government&mdash;I do not really think it rings true. We are doing the best we can. I must say, though, that in the standing committees both Labor and the coalition are working well together, but when people want to throw mud, they should have a look in their own backyard first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as people travelling in charter aircraft are concerned, I am  a great believer that if you are a commuter&mdash;a member of the general public&mdash;you need to have a greater awareness of your rights when using the aviation industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people are not sure about the flight they are about to take, if they are not really keen on the aircraft because it may not look that good, or if they have something like a gut feeling that makes them feel that something is not right, they should ask the pilot. If it is a light charter aircraft usually there will be, as well as yourself, six to 10 others, the pilot and maybe a stewardess or assistant. It does not hurt; there is no problem with asking. That is a great problem with the general public. People do not understand or do not know their rights in relation to air travel. We are all responsible for our own safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to people, one and all, if you are about to travel on a light aircraft charter, regular public transport or a private flight, if there is something you are not sure about, ask the pilot. You never know, you might find out that something is amiss and you may be helping yourself and your fellow passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know when I jump on a private aircraft or when I am being transported around the country on charter aircraft I usually have a quick look around the aircraft myself. There is nothing wrong with that. You do not have to touch anything; you just have to have a bit of a look around and see whether the plane looks all right. Quite a lot of pilots do that. They take an extreme interest in other people's aircraft. In an aeroplane, there is a place for everything and everything in its place. If something is not right or something is not neat and tidy you can usually tell with the naked eye.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing I wish to bring into the discussion today is where the industry has gone in the short time that Minister Sharp has had an opportunity to do something with it. There is a different perception floating around in the community. People are starting to become more au fait, more comfortable, with dealing with safety investigators. They are not perceived as the Gestapo any more. They are starting to be seen as a group of individuals who are trying to do something for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are a pilot or are involved in the aviation industry and you make a valid, genuine mistake, then there is no reason why you should not be able to approach the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and talk to them. The industry should know that if it is not sure about something it should ask. They cannot throw you into gaol for that. It was a perception that people had in years past that if you put your head up you might get it knocked off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing in particular that the industry has developed and which has come a long way is the bulletin produced by the aviation industry through CASA. It is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Airservices Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. It is good reading material for pilots. It gives a bit of an indication of what is going on in the industry at present, and it brings the investigators, the bureaucracy, of the industry closer to the people. I think that that is absolutely important.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7747">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the bulletin are electronic safety incident reports, and I will allude to one of them. The executive summary reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Piper PA28&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a single engine light aircraft&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was on a zone flight in the Sydney zone and identified an aircraft which flew into his path as a Lancair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Piper PA28 was on a zone flight from Hornsby to the Harbour Bridge at 1500' when the radar controller noticed a primary paint on a north&hyphen;easterly heading well in the control zone.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Obviously the controller was looking at his screen as the radar was painting the picture of what was in the air at the time, and he identified this aircraft. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Traffic was passed and the Piper confirmed he had a white Lancair in sight in the 0230 position. The Piper stated the altitude of the Lancair was 1300'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As we can see, there was a 200 feet difference between the two aircraft&mdash;that is how it appeared by sight. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The radar paints merged as the aircraft passed over each other. When questioned by Flight Service, the Lancair pilot mentioned he had flown close to a Piper Cherokee and believed he should have had right of way. The Lancair was unaware he had flown through the Sydney control zone.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The industry needs to update itself. We see this need coming very shortly with Airspace 2000. There is a perception out there at the moment that Airspace 2000 is going to cause people and pilots heartache, that it is going to make industry unsafe. This is the furthest thing from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Airspace 2000 is aircraft that will be flying around in various parts of the country, particularly between the altitudes of 4,500 feet to 8,000&hyphen;odd feet. It is mandatory that they carry charlie&hyphen;mode transponders. The idea is that aircraft which travel with these transponders will be able to be seen on a radar. It is as simple as that. People will know their exact position, their altitude, where they are going and where they are coming from. It is about time the industry got up to date and installed these things and had them in operation in aircraft as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing the industry could do to update itself&mdash;particularly for private pilots; they mostly seem to be the ones who are coming somewhat unstuck&mdash;is to have global positioning systems. You can purchase most GPSs for around the $1,000 to $1,500 mark these days. They have moving map displays which show your aircraft the track where it is going&mdash;from one point relative to the other&mdash;and it also shows the airspace and whether you are going to invade that airspace or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If pilots had an opportunity to use GPS, then it would be of great benefit to all. Not only would it stop some people being unaware of their positions and getting lost and costing the industry a lot of money, but also it would help people to locate themselves throughout the country so that they do not get into controlled airspace that they should not be in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem at the moment is that within the aviation industry you are not allowed to use something that is not a recognised and approved instrument or that is not TSO'd or whatever. What we need to do is have a closer look at this and make the industry and the systems more user friendly. The instrument may not have the ability to be interrogated by itself. We have various aviation GPSs and they cost up to $10,000. I have one in my aircraft. It is TSO'd, but it is only for VFR flight and cost about $5,000. If people had the opportunity to use GPSs and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7748"> the industry accepted them all, we would be a lot better off because people would carry them whereas at the moment it is not accepted as fair and equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like the aviation industry in Australia to have a closer look at the use of GPS. Fair enough, it may not be an approved GPS, but I am telling you right here and now it would go a long way towards making the industry safer; it would stop people from encroaching on airspace that they should not be in, and it would also go a long way towards helping people who may get lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, as far as I am concerned the coalition government is doing its best. With the cooperation of the Labor opposition, maybe we will have an opportunity to really redevelop our aviation industry in this country. It is an industry that has been brought to its knees over recent years. A lot of pilots have had to sell their aircraft. They cannot afford to be in the industry any longer. It has become far too expensive. That is another great problem. People try to look at appropriate safety in relation to the expense. We need to have a change in thinking in the industry, a change in focus in the industry and, hopefully, with all that in mind, it will become a better industry for all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, let me firstly congratulate you for being appointed to that position. Welcome to the club. Let me also assure you that it will be the hardest $28 a month you will ever earn in this parliament. Nevertheless, I wish you well in the position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to be able to make a short contribution to this debate on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame&mdash;a sequel</EMPHASIS>. You might ask, `What is the condition of ships in Australian waters today?' Before we answer that we have to separate the types of ships in the Australian waters. Australian flagged and crewed ships, in general, and especially the larger ones, are in very good condition. However, I had an unfortunate incident in my area last year when a coastal vessel went aground at Bass Point. It was found out later that there were lots of questions about the condition of that ship. But, in general, the Australian flagged and crewed ships around the Australian coastline are in quite good condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to the condition of ships that are flagged and crewed from overseas. Despite the report of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame&mdash;a sequel</EMPHASIS> and the publicity that the report has received, in general the condition of these ships has not greatly improved. I note from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS> that on average about 10 or 12 ships are detained each month for a variety of defects. Some of these are only minor defects, but some ships are detained for quite serious defects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that the general public and, indeed, the trade are more aware of the conditions of ships. I am a great supporter of AMSA. I think they are doing a good job and that they are carrying out more inspections now than they were a few years ago. But nothing that I have seen shows any great improvement in the condition of ships. Because of this, there are a couple of basic facts that we have to consider.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7749">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world's shipping fleet is ageing&mdash;there is absolutely no doubt about that. We have not been replacing ships, and maybe that is because it is too expensive. I have long argued that we should have a ship construction industry here in Australia. When people talk to me about cost, the labour costs in Korea and Japan are as high as ours today and a few years ago I saw a ship construction works in Denmark where their wages were as high as those in Australia. By using modern technology, we could have a ship building industry here and we should also have a ship repair facility along the east coast of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the world's fleet is ageing and the trade is becoming increasingly competitive. It seems to me that, in a competitive environment, we should be looking at well maintained ships, properly trained crews and properly paid and fed crews. Exactly the reverse is what we have got. We have poor ships, with often appalling conditions and poorly trained crews, and multi&hyphen;crewed as a method of controlling the crew. There will be half a dozen different languages spoken among the crew. They will be poorly paid, if they are paid at all, and poorly fed. That is the condition of many, many ships along the Australian coast today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My reports, especially with regard to Port Kembla, are that we still see these poor ships coming in there. I wonder if this would still happen if these ships were crewed not by Third World countries but by nationals of other countries. Many of the Third World crew are in a form of bondage. We like to think slavery ended over 100 years ago, but I sometimes wonder when I see the conditions that these crews have to endure on these ships. If it were not for the Missions to Seamen and, indeed, the International Transport Federation, the conditions would be even worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But a price is paid when people contact the ITF&mdash;the International Transport Federation. There have been cases of bashings and of black&hyphen;listing. The black list still exists for those crews who approach the unions about getting their proper pay; they are black&hyphen;listed and never work again on a seagoing vessel. With many people when they are in Australian ports&mdash;and I have had personal experience of this&mdash;the captain pays them the amount while they are here to get them out of the Australian port and when they are out of the port that money is taken back off them. This happens time and time again. Indeed, what also often happens&mdash;and I had occasion to mention this in the House last night&mdash;is that seafarers disappear off the Australian coastline. We say nothing about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If someone fell out of a plane, we most certainly would hear about that. I remember recently that a plane was coming from Fiji or somewhere and someone fell out of it. We have just had a debate on aviation safety and we all get terribly concerned about that. But often when a crew member has complained about conditions on a ship or has made contact with the ITF representative in one of the Australian ports, if they are sailing from Fremantle across to Adelaide or Melbourne they do not make it&mdash;their grave is the Great Australian Bight; or if they made contact with the ITF representative in Port Kembla or Sydney and their ship is going on to Brisbane, Mackay, or somewhere north, their grave is off the east coast of Australia&mdash;a very watery grave. This happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people ought to start asking a few questions about how many foreign seafarers go overboard off the coast of Australia. Quite frankly, it would astonish you if you knew the number of seafarers who go missing off the coast of Australia.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SAWFORD" NAMEID="3J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3J4">Mr Sawford</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And no press reports?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No press. The press is not interested. If a light plane went down in Denmark or Finland and three people were killed, it would make page 2 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7750"> or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> . If there was an Australian on it, it would make page 1. We had 185 seafarers go down off the coast of Western Australia in an 18&hyphen;month period and no media in Australia thought that important enough to report. You are right about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are also finding increasingly is shonky foreign operators using the Australian legal system and the Australian courts to protect their evil ways. We have 45D, unfortunately, on the legislation books in Australia. Some of the few people using that disgraceful piece of legislation are lawyers acting for shonky shipping owners out of London, or slick and sleazy ones, as the industry knows, out of Greece.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a case at the moment, which the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) has highlighted before in this parliament, about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">MV Hunter</EMPHASIS>. Australian lawyers, who should be ashamed of themselves, are using Australian laws to protect shonky overseas owners who are discriminating against and mistreating foreign crews. Australian lawyers who are doing that by using 45D should be ashamed of themselves. They bring no credit to their profession at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole question of shipping today and the condition of crews more and more are becoming an industrial relations issue in Australia and in Australian courts&mdash;because undoubtedly it is going to tie up our courts as well. Shonky foreign owners, as I was saying, are increasingly using Australian courts and the Australian legal profession, and this government is doing absolutely nothing about it. It is giving passive support to what these lawyers are doing in using the Australian legal system to protect shonky overseas owners and to disadvantage their crews, who are often from Third World countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would not tolerate what goes on in ships if it happened on the buses plying around Australia. When you and I fly business class&mdash;we do not fly first class any more&mdash;if we had a half&hyphen;starved steward serving us our meal or a drink we would be ashamed. If we saw the bruises on them where they had been bashed, or if the captain occasionally left the cockpit and gave it over to the pilot and took an iron bar&mdash;as a captain did in Port Hedland&mdash;and beat one of the crew on the aircraft that we were flying on, we would be a little concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We might even get up in this parliament and make a speech about it. We would say that that was not the Australian way of dealing with our employees or our crew. If it does not happen on buses or aircraft, why do we turn a blind eye when such things happen on shipping?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do have genuine concerns about doing away with cabotage, about opening our coastal runs. People say to me it will bring down the rates&mdash;I am not quite sure it will bring down the rates&mdash;and if the rates become so low jobs will most definitely be taken away from the railway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot in this parliament and in the media about the bribe&mdash;or whatever you might like to call it&mdash;during the recent Northern Territory election, when the federal government kicked in $100 million for the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line. We were told that this was going to bring down freight costs and that ships were going to come to Darwin with containers and rail would bring them down here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cannot have it both ways. They are talking about opening the Australian coastline and that will bring the cost down as well. You cannot have it both ways. If you bring the cost of the coastal shipping down that low through having rust buckets and Third World, poorly paid crews on them, your economic argument for the Alice Springs to Darwin railway will not stand up. If it is going to be as cheap&mdash;as you are all saying&mdash;along the coast, why 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7751"> build the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line when it would be so much cheaper just to leave it all on the ships to come around?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said before that I was generally satisfied with the condition of ships&mdash;Australian crewed and Australian flagged&mdash;but I do have a concern about some of the cattle ships, especially those out of Darwin. I do not want to say anything here that would jeopardise that trade because I support that trade but I think we have to give a bit of attention to the condition of some of those ships and the conditions for some of the crews.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, even if you do not agree with it, you would appreciate that there is a manic determination&mdash;I will not say who has got it&mdash;to destroy the Maritime Union of Australia. There is an ideological hatred by certain sections of this parliament of the MTU. Let me say that it has been tried before: people have tried to destroy the Maritime Union of Australia. The old troops have been threatened. But it will not work. My members and I will fight and we will resist this. So forget that manic determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People today are more aware of the conditions of shipping but do they care? I suggest to honourable members, and I do this genuinely, that they visit the Mission to Seamen in their city and talk to the crews. Even if members do not represent a port, most of the ports around Australia have a Mission to Seamen facility. Foreign crews might not always be able to talk because they might be frightened to talk or they might have difficulties with the language but members can talk to the chaplain at any Mission to Seamen around the Australian coastline. Let me tell you that the stories that they will tell you will horrify you. Then ask yourselves, is this what we want in Australia? Is this what we want for Australian workers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear much about the level playing field. There is nothing level about this playing field&mdash;if we can use that term with regard to shipping&mdash;introducing rust buckets of the world to the Australian coastal run, crewed by underpaid, abused seafarers, often from Third World countries. It is un&hyphen;Australian and we should not tolerate it for one moment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I have to put another hat on now and speak briefly on the report on Australia's relations with southern Africa. It was my privilege, when this committee was first established in the last parliament, to chair this committee. We had completed most of the work when the election was called. When the new parliament was formed, and the committee was formed again, the bringing down of the report came under the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a lot of suggestions about what we should look at. As a committee of this parliament looking at sub&hyphen;Saharan Africa, we found it such a diverse, huge and complex area that we had some difficulty focusing on exactly what we should be looking at. Basically, we wanted to look at the impact of the democratic South Africa on post&hyphen;apartheid Africa. There had been genuine elections and there was majority rule in South Africa, which was playing its part, and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7752"> we wanted to look at the impact of that, and so we settled on the SADC countries to focus our attention on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true to say that most of the evidence that we received and most of the witnesses that came before us were either from South Africa or Zimbabwe. After Mauritius joined SADC we also had some very important input from that state. We did receive some written submissions from some of the other countries, but there was not the same input from the other SADC countries that there had been from South Africa and Zimbabwe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real worry that many people expressed was that South Africa, because of its economic and trading strength, would dominate the region to an extent, and there has been debate about whether there should be free trade between the areas or not. It is true and, I guess, inevitable that South Africa would play a very dominant role in that part of the world. It is of concern that we in Australia do not put the emphasis that I feel we should on the whole of southern Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It always seems to me that in this country we can only manage to focus on one country at a time. A few years ago, it was all China. Everything was for China: we were doing reports in China, trade delegations were going there and trade delegations were coming here. We often do that at the expense of other countries. It is the same with the rest of Asia. I am one of the keenest supporters of the idea, and I actually do fundamentally believe, that our future and our destiny lie with Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, having said that, we should not forget our traditional markets and our contacts with European countries&mdash;and, indeed, Africa. We should not. Africa is not easy; it is difficult. And in many cases we are in a competitive situation, especially with South Africa, not only on the sporting field but also in the trading field. We have the question of our wine. South Africa rightly tries to expand its wine market throughout Europe but this is going to impact on Australian wine sales unless we lift our game and make sure that it does not. The same goes for coal and a whole range of things that South Africa deals in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone tells me these are very difficult economic times, but I think that some of our missions there could do with an increase in staff. For instance, it is quite silly having the high commissioner to Zimbabwe representing seven or eight countries. I recently was speaking to someone who has been appointed high commissioner to Nigeria and I said, `You are going to Nigeria: what other countries are you going to be accredited to?' And he listed all the other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that we have discussed this in other forums, but one thing I have always felt is that we did not achieve what we wanted to with a position on the Security Council in the United Nations ballot last year, because we had largely ignored Africa diplomatically. I know we sent our high commissioners around Africa to do a little bit of lobbying, but there is no substitute for having someone there. For example, Namibia is a country where I feel we should have a high commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My personal view is only a feeling I have&mdash;and I have nothing to substantiate it&mdash;that we should have put more effort into the African continent and, over the past few years, not cut down on our representation throughout Africa so that we now have not got anyone at all to represent us in francophone Africa. They have a huge voting block in the United Nations, but what have we got? We have a high commission in Kenya, one in South Africa and one in Zimbabwe. I led a famous delegation through Africa a few years back&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, you can read about it. One of the recommendations that we made was to reopen a post in Ethiopia at Addis Ababa, as a previous delegation had recommended three years before. We went to Addis Ababa. That post was opened for two or three years. The Canadians came in and bought everything at bargain basement prices. When we got there, after two years, it had closed down. Ethiopia is the headquarters of the Organisation of African Unity. It is represented by the High Commissioner to Kenya. At that time, I argued that we should have it even as a listening post. Our report suggested that we should reopen that post in Addis. The general public were more interested in other parts of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have made a whole host of recommendations in connection with Australia's relations with southern Africa. It is an important area for Australia, and it is going to be increasingly important to us. Too often in the past, we have treated southern Africa far too casually, as we have so many other countries. It is very rare for even a parliamentary delegation to go there. I know they are not the flavour of the month at the moment. We tend to take it so much for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point about southern Africa is that they are much better represented in Australia. You have to look at the countries that have high commissioners and ambassadors here from the whole of southern Africa and the ones that we have there. Far too often, southern Africa suffers from this fixation of Australia&mdash;Australian politicians, policy makers and media&mdash;and Australia in general. They are only able to focus on one part of the world at a time. The world is not all that big. It is not too big for us to have interests in various parts of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the two countries that we had most to do with in this inquiry are very ably represented by the two representatives in this country. We are also very ably represented in those countries. We got a tremendous amount of assistance from the South African High Commission here and the Zimbabwe High Commission. Indeed, anything we asked for from our posts in those countries, they supplied us. This was a timely report and I hope that the recommendations that the committee made will be acted on.</PARA></SPEECH>

As the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has just mentioned, he made a visit to Africa a little while ago. Quite apart from the nature and character of some of the relations between members of that delegation, it is true that time moves on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very concerned about the quality of our overseas representation. While I very strongly support the theory behind the funding cuts in federal government departments, there are a number of areas where I think the product on the ground is less than satisfactory. I do worry that there is talk at the moment, for example, of having one&hyphen;person posts, which I think is absolute rubbish. There is no capacity to effectively represent a country&mdash;no matter how good the individual&mdash;if there is only going to be one person. I think it is tremendously important that we maintain good quality representation abroad. It is important that we maintain an integrity of foreign policy administration. I do not think there is any area where that is more apparent than in South Africa or in southern Africa&mdash;indeed, in Africa generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Throsby's reference to Ethiopia, of course, extends somewhat outside the boundaries that we are examining in the context of this report that we are debating at the moment. I would also like to commend, as I did in the main chamber, the honourable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7754"> member for Throsby, through whose initiative in the previous parliament we picked up this report. There were some difficulties in determining boundaries. Unfortunately, the time and the capacity of the committee to examine relations beyond the state of our countries was such that we felt we had to put a line somewhere. We would have liked to have looked at relations with other countries on the African continent. In fact, I think this report is a good one, and the honourable member played a very important part in its initiation and its progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are really three issues that I want to pick up from the report. The first follows a seminar we had on the Commonwealth a few weeks ago. At a time when the traumas following the death of Princess Diana are very much in the news headlines, at a time when our own constitutional convention to consider the future of the monarchical form of government in Australia is moving along towards the conduct of that convention, and with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) having addressed this morning in the main chamber some aspects of his consideration of the republican debate, it is important that we look at the Commonwealth. It is not a British Commonwealth; it is a Commonwealth of nations of which Britain is a member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we look at the Commonwealth because the countries in southern Africa that we are talking about are largely members of the Commonwealth. I, for one, have really been pleasantly surprised at the extent to which, within the Commonwealth, there is a real opportunity for us to still work together in another international forum in ways that many of us have tended to cynically regard as being perhaps a little archaic. I can assure everyone that is not so. The product of that seminar&mdash;and there will be a report produced, which we will discuss in detail in due course&mdash;did emphasise to me that there is an opportunity for Australia, in its role in the Commonwealth, to maintain a dialogue with a relatively smaller group of countries that might otherwise not come together. I say `smaller' while not referring to the size of the countries but to the number of countries participating, and within that group to have very personal discussions. Of course, with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Edinburgh not far away, there is going to be an opportunity for some of the proposals that we discussed at that seminar to come forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise this matter in particular in relation to this report because, if people look at the recommendations, they will notice some of our concerns about educational opportunities. I believe quite strongly that part of the great benefits of the Marshall aid plan and the Colombo Plan were the opportunities that they gave the post&hyphen;World War II generation to exchange ideas and understanding on a raft of issues. They would never have had a chance to do that if they had not been educated in other countries. My strong view is that, in the educational field, it would have been far better if we had given to a number of overseas students preferred access to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few years ago, Singapore was just emerging after its split from what was an aborted marriage with Malaysia, and was attempting to establish its role as an industrial country. There is no doubt that in those days a number of young Singaporeans who had been educated in Australia, whether they be engineers, architects, lawyers, accountants or other professionals, looked automatically to Australia as their natural partner. We have got to pick up that theme. In the report that we are examining at the moment, as in that seminar, we have spoken about educational opportunities. Recommendation 34, for example, refers to Australian universities and TAFEs `collectively promoting the opportunities for education, both in&hyphen;country and in Australia . . . in southern African countries'. We spoke about a number of other aspects of education throughout the report.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7755">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, it seems to me that through the Commonwealth we have been apparently cutting out some of the preferred access available in the past. I know we have to look at how our universities are funded, but I think that in so many areas it is important to identify what is a foreign policy interest and then establish the best way to promote it. It is not just a matter of the overseas representation to which the member referred; it is the matter of our looking at what is in Australia's long&hyphen;term best interests in developing and promoting cooperation and understanding with future generations from other countries&mdash;and education is an ideal way by which this can be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe equally strongly that Radio Australia's Cox Peninsula transmitter, for example, also served a very vital function. I am very disappointed that it has not been reopened and I am hoping that it might be possible for that to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have to do in Australia is to promote a cooperative and willing relationship with the countries around the world so that we are seen, not as European or American, but as Australian. We can do that by offering educational opportunities through the Commonwealth or, as this says, specifically through Australian institutions with the countries of SADC in a way which ensures that there is an ongoing recognition by those future leaders of those countries that we are their natural partner. In exactly the same way as in the past with Singapore, when they turned to Australia for help and where we had enormous commercial and social advantages out of being an actual partner, we need to do that with the countries of SADC and the Commonwealth. We need to look at ways by which we can extend an understanding in the younger people. If we can do that, there is an enormous advantage for Australia and I think we need to commit some resources to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, with respect to this report, at the moment one of the subcommittees of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is doing an inquiry into our relations with India. As one who comes from an eastern state&mdash;as, indeed, do all of us around this room at this time&mdash;perhaps we do not see the Indian Ocean in the same way as those who live in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the fascinating parts of my childhood was that for those of us interested in collecting stamps there were those that came from a place called Cocos Islands, Indian Ocean. Even the name used to fascinate me. It was something that was way out there; how it came to be part of Australia, I never could quite conceive. But it is, and has been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we understand that the Indian Ocean is as significant an area of the world in every way as is the Pacific. It might not have the superpowers: it has not got the United States, for example, and China is not an Indian Ocean power. But it does have India, and India is the second most populous country in the world. We have an Indian minister, Dr Ramaiah, in town at the moment and I think it is great that he is thinking of ways by which those countries of the Indian Ocean rim can work more effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the former foreign minister, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), for the initiative he took in the meeting in Perth to bring together nations of the region to see whether it could be a focus. It is not an APEC look&hyphen;alike&mdash;APEC is a different organisation. But I think it is important that we look towards the Indian Ocean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give full credit to Dr Mahathir, the Prime Minister of Malaysia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Mahathir and Mr Mandela from South Africa have developed a relationship. They have been visiting each other's countries. They have been taking groups of business people to each other's countries and elsewhere, and they are promoting a link, in part through the Commonwealth and in part 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7756"> bilaterally. We need to understand, as Australians, that if we are not going to be left behind as the economies in the region around us grow, we have to be very active participants in trying to make sure that we develop the same relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trade with South Africa has grown at surprising rates since we have produced this report, and it is one of the factors that we looked at. Within southern Africa and the SADC countries&mdash;and this report refers to them&mdash;the relations between South Africa and each of those countries is as a major power with a number of relatively smaller powers. It does not mean that South Africa is setting the pace entirely, but it does mean that it is very important that we develop relations with South Africa commercially and in every political sense so that we can jointly help each others' economic, social and political growth. And as we do so, the long&hyphen;term benefit is the security and the stability that flows, and we are looking at that in terms of where we go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, in the report we also refer to ongoing medical and rehabilitation assistance to landmine victims. We talk about community education on landmines and training for local people in demining methods, because we can see the product of the instability that has been so apparent in so many of those countries for so long&mdash;during the days of apartheid, and even now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final thing I want to say relates to the next matter before us. Freedom from corruption, a free press, an independent administration, an impartial police force, and what we in the West call good governance are still fundamental in each of the countries of the region. I know the traumas that President Mandela has had in his government, trying to bring together those who were part of the apartheid regime and incorporating everybody, in particular the significant black majority, into the modern government of South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in other countries of the region there has not been the political stability that one would hope for. I do not know how we allow these countries to grow and develop and how we give them the opportunities for what we call good governance to prevail. In many there is corruption in government, one party government, a press that is dictated to rather than allowed free expression, a police force which is inadequately paid and unable to operate as it might, and public servants who are inadequately paid and unable to act in an impartial way. Above all, many lack an independent judicial system where the rule of law allows individual human rights to be respected. These are all parts of the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am one of those who totally oppose the idea that Dr Mahathir has been promoting that there be some form of alternative Atlantic Charter, suggesting that some collective human rights are far more significant than individual human rights. Unless we respect the rights of each individual to their share of space under the sun, I do not believe the countries of the world are going to be able to live in peace with each other. If a country has collective rights, that inevitably leads to repression and to the abuse of power by individuals; and that, of course, is totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I do commend this report to the government, and trust that it might serve in some way to advance relations between the countries of southern Africa and Australia. They are very important to us, geographically and in the world, and perhaps it might be another way by which we can look at our future relations within the Commonwealth; for there, too, there is a great deal that can be done to promote Australia's future influence in the wider world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am sorry to inflict myself on the Main Committee again immediately, but I want to say a few things about the report from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade seminar on Papua New Guinea. I am glad that the report has been referred to the committee. When Sir John Coles, the permanent under&hyphen;secretary to the foreign affairs department of the United Kingdom, asked me what I thought was Australia's major foreign policy priority, I told him it was our relations with PNG.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many bilateral and multilateral fora in which Australia participates. One looks at the population in Indonesia and other nations in ASEAN, one looks at the economies of those countries and one looks at our relations with Asia generally. It might be said that given PNG's four million people odd, and given its proximity to Australia, it would hardly be seen as our major foreign policy priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my mind, Papua New Guinea is our priority, and it will be forever, for one simple reason. We need to understand in Australia that PNG is not part of Australia. It is a separate nation, and an independent nation. It is dependent on us, but it is independent from us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to make sure that in our dealings with the people of PNG we give them help and encouragement so they can remain internally stable; so they can free themselves from the corruption and greed which tragically seems to be almost endemic in some of their political processes; and so they can operate freely in a way which allows that extraordinarily diverse country, with more than 600 languages and with 800 different ethnic and tribal groups, to bind together to become a modern nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have an enormous responsibility in this country to provide a sympathetic ear and help and guidance, but to allow them always to be an independent nation and to see themselves in a way which ensures that we do not set the policies for them. We can help them so that, in setting their own policies, they can play a worthwhile and stable part in this region of the world where so many changes have occurred in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report was an update of an earlier inquiry we did on Papua New Guinea. Its recommendations were intended to try to ensure that we looked at some of the ongoing problems. I am not going to deal with them all. Perhaps, again, there are three that I should talk about. Bougainville is predominant. The second is the extent to which, in relations between the new industries, particularly the mining industry, and traditional land&hyphen;holders, there can be a meaningful negotiation which allows each to benefit. That, of course, is not dissimilar to the problem between the people on Bougainville and those operating the Panguna mine. Until you have got a meaningful relationship which allows you to use the resources, the people of the region are not going to be able to get the full benefit. But you have got to do it in a way which is open, apparent and brings equal benefit to everybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the first issue I mentioned, in Bougainville you are not going to be able to look at how you are going to reopen the mine until you have settled the problems of Bougainville, and I will come back to that in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third problem, which is really the significant part of where we are now, is to go on from this report and see things as they are on 3 September 1997 with a new Prime Minister and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7758"> a new government. I will just talk a little bit from there and then come back to the other two issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing I should say is that the joint committee was very fortunate to have an excellent briefing from Professor Ron May and Anthony Regan of the Australian National University earlier this week. I felt they gave us an outstanding analysis of where we are in the Bougainville negotiations and also of the consequence of the election of Prime Minister Bill Skate, and gave us some perception of where they think the government is going. They are two committed Australians, and I think we are very fortunate we have men like them, and others, who academically and personally remain committed to PNG. It is of great concern&mdash;and is one of the reasons that we produced the report&mdash;that so many younger Australians do not really give the emphasis and perhaps understanding to PNG that there was amongst those who were patrol officers or members of the then colonial administration in PNG. It is not a matter of suggesting we go back to some form of colonial relationship, but I would certainly very much like to see large numbers of younger Australians being involved in PNG.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The paradox, as those of us who have been there know, is that everything that happens in Australia is seen and known and felt to be part of the lives of villagers in PNG. They listen to our radio. They listen to our television. They are more committed to Rugby League and what happens there and the traumas of the dispute with Super League than I think half of the Australians you might talk to are, simply because it is very much real to them that we are like big brother. Because we had a colonial relationship, it does give us a fairly unique connection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got to understand that they recognise us, they know a little bit about us and they aspire in some ways to be like us, but they want to be their own version. Yet there are so few of the younger generation of Australians who know a great deal about PNG. I think one of the challenges we have, and we talked about it in this report, is to get the next generation of Australians&mdash;today's generation of business managers and professionals&mdash;interested in PNG and to recognise the way in which our mutual connection is going to be important for each of us into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government is one about which I mentioned that Professor May and Anthony Regan had advised us. Theirs are subjective judgments. I think we all look at the election of Bill Skate and hope that it will be able to provide honest, fair and competent administration. There are enormous challenges for the country. The infrastructures are really very poor. The communications base leaves a lot to be desired. You still cannot travel, for example, from Port Moresby to the highlands. You cannot travel from Port Moresby to Lae by road. Those who have seen the Kokoda Trail agree it is a remarkable mountain range and it is a very physical barrier. It is going to be a major challenge to try and provide even the concept of PNG as people living in the one country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, we have enough troubles trying to get&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;Queenslanders to think as Australians at times, or Western Australians or Tasmanians to think as Australians. We tend to think of our own region and of its priorities. So in a place where many have not travelled that far out of their own village, and to do so they have to walk miles over fairly steep and precipitous paths, it is no wonder it is like that. Until we overcome that problem, the challenges for any government are enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all wish Bill Skate well. It is an enormous challenge. Sadly, there were a number of fundamental mistakes made, quite apart from the Sandline affair, by the government of the then Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan. I have known Julius through all his political career and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7759"> I feel sad that he was not able to bring together the parties within Bougainville in the way he originally committed himself in the early days of his administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bill Skate seems to be starting off in negotiating quite admirably in Bougainville&mdash;and I want to talk about that shortly. We certainly wish him well. He needs to make sure that the press remains open and fair. He needs to be quite conscious that if there is corruption in his administration, people are going to be very sceptical of the outcome. I do not like the vote buying process that operates in PNG; I am very apprehensive about the way in which there seem to be favours gained for contributions made. I do not think that is a practice which any of us in Australia see as one which will enable a fair and dispassionate administration. One would hope that as a cleanskin, if you like, Prime Minister Bill Skate will be able to set new standards and therefore maintain an administration in an open and just way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, there is a judiciary there which is impartial and all of us who have seen something of it have a great admiration for the way in which it operates. Of course, the second inquiry into the Sandline affair is being conducted in an impartial and dispassionate way. That is not just in the judiciary; there is also a free press, which I think is wonderful. But there is a need for something more; there needs to be a move away from the wantok system. Those of us who know the place know of the enormous problems in trying to treat everybody equitably; and, regrettably, in PNG the wantok system seems to deny that. It is a big challenge for Prime Minister Skate and his administration to ensure they govern for all PNG people and not just for the few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Bougainville, Anthony Regan gave us an excellent briefing. Our foreign minister, Alexander Downer, committed himself and the government to a process which is now fortunately accepted by the Skate administration, as it was in its dying days by the Chan administration. This process, from what they call the Barter report, is a process of getting people out of the care centres in Bougainville, of re&hyphen;establishing negotiations between the parties and establishing a peaceful cease&hyphen;fire from which there can be a restoration of normal village life and commercial activity in Bougainville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The foreign minister has undertaken to provide $100 million of Australian aid to Bougainville over the course of the next five years. That is very good, but we have been offering aid for years and it has not been capable of being delivered because of the security conditions there. That is a problem. When Stephen Loosley, who was then Senator Loosley, and Senator Vicki Bourne and I visited there some years ago, we certainly looked very closely at what we might be able to do to try and open a few of the ports there. Senator Calvert was also a member of that delegation. The difficulty we found was that the security risk prevented the aid being given. If you could only open Buin, for example, in the south, you would be able to get the local village crops sold and get a cash flow into the economy, and people would be able to start living in a normal way. That, to my mind, is fundamental.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend Mr Regan; I thought his address to us the other day was excellent. There is hope through the New Zealand initiative&mdash;and full marks to the New Zealanders for taking that initiative. They have been able to bring the parties together. I am not going to talk about individuals, but I do hope that Francis Ona participates in the process and I hope that he is prepared to accept the judgment that has been made by others, that it is not now a question of looking at any one issue in the peace talks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to have peace talks, the parties have to agree to a cease&hyphen;fire. They have to get the people out of the care centres and back into the villages to allow the village economy to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7760"> resume. From there, they will have some prospect of being able to re&hyphen;establish normal communications from which they have a chance to talk about the fundamental issues. If you have a dispute with anyone, it is no use talking about the things where you totally disagree; it is better to start with the things where you can agree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People need to remember that Bougainville is a matrilineal society. I have always advocated that women, to a far greater degree, should be allowed to participate in the negotiations there. On the visits that I have made to Bougainville, I have been very impressed with the quality of the women there. Sister Veronica Brady was one of those who attended the peace talks that were held there some little while ago. I think it is a great tragedy that the women have not been allowed to play a greater role. I remember when Sister Veronica came back she spoke of the tremendous goodwill that there was amongst all of the women, many of whom were from different faiths&mdash;some were Protestants, some were Catholic. There were people there with different prejudices and different wantok.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, a matrilineal society only means that there is an inheritance through the female line. It does not mean that the women have the authority. The men have to accept that, if they are going to re&hyphen;establish normal life in the villages and get Bougainville together again, they have to give status to women in those negotiations, and not just allow a nominal presence of a women in the negotiations. If that happened, I think everybody would be better off. That is the only real advice that I would have in that area. I hope that the next round of talks, to which Australia is prepared to give whatever assistance it can, are successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final thing is that there is a necessity for all mining ventures, for all investment projects, to take account of the interests of the villagers. There are obviously always problems in trying to determine how sustainable commercial operations can be undertaken. I think it is particularly important that there is a recognition by the villagers that there is long-term benefit for them, for employment, in allowing companies to take advantage of the rich resources that are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that under Prime Minister Bill Skate there is the chance to give PNG the future that we all want it to have&mdash;that is, a stable one with opportunities for better education, health, welfare, and a stable family environment within the village structure. There are enormous challenges ahead and we wish Prime Minister Skate well in his task. We trust that, in the dialogue that has to be ongoing between Australia and PNG, particularly through project aid and the way in which our very generous aid program is now maintained, some hope can come out of the trauma of the Sandline affair which, last year, seemed to have ended in absolute disaster. We trust that under a new Prime Minister there is a future and we wish them well.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always very difficult to follow the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in some of these debates. I do not want to be repetitive but I want to mention some of the things that he has raised. I agree with the right honourable gentleman that this is an important report about an important country as part of our bilateral relationships. I will come back to that in a moment in terms of the wider foreign affairs and trade policy white paper which was tabled very recently by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">l was very pleased to chair this seminar over two days in November. Most of the issues are still there and have not really been addressed substantively. Like the right honourable gentleman who spoke before me, I commend to the government the 14 recommendations in the report.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7761">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there are a number of people that this parliament has to thank for the success of what was a groundbreaking seminar. We have had a number of seminars since then but, as I said, I will come back to those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we need first to thank His Excellency Ken Noga, the PNG high commissioner here in Canberra, without whose cooperation and contribution this seminar would not have been possible. We owe a vote of thanks to Vice Admiral David Leach&mdash;the Chief of Naval Staff when I was serving&mdash;as the president of the Australia&hyphen;PNG friendship group. David Leach played an important part over those two days in ensuring the success of the seminar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank my parliamentary colleagues and, indeed, everybody who contributed, whether they be academics, whether they be business people, both in Australia and in PNG. We did have a large contribution from those in Papua New Guinea conversant with what goes on in terms of life up there at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want particularly to congratulate the right honourable member for New England&mdash;but not to embarrass him&mdash;because this really is a groundbreaking report. It concerns the first of a series of seminars held in this parliament within this Joint Standing Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I know such an approach has been tried with varying degrees of success in the past, but this was the first seminar series. Subsequently we have had a very successful one&hyphen;day aid seminar, which was attended by a wide range of people. We have had a two&hyphen;day seminar on the very important ANZUS alliance. Most recently, we have had another one&hyphen;day seminar, on Commonwealth relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of the credit for the establishment of that concept goes to the right honourable gentleman, and I take the opportunity to congratulate him. I hope that for the remainder of this parliament we will continue with that concept of seminars, because I think it is important that we maintain a dialogue and that that dialogue is, very importantly, two&hyphen;way. With respect to this seminar and subsequent ones, particularly the ANZUS seminar, I understand&mdash;unfortunately, I was not able to attend either the ANZUS or the Commonwealth seminar&mdash;there was a lot of positive feedback. I think that says a lot for the processes that have been put in train.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report makes 14 recommendations, all of importance but in varying ways. I want to highlight the last one:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Australian Government recognise the significance of Papua New Guinea in its foreign policy priorities and acknowledge through the maintenance of the AusAid and Defence Cooperation Programs the unique challenges that Papua New Guinea faces in building its administrative capacity, in developing its infrastructure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which Mr Sinclair has referred to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">particularly in health, education and employment generation, in improving law and order and in resolving&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that festering sore&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Bougainville crisis peacefully.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that, in the most recent tabling of a white paper, a lot of those issues have been addressed and accepted strategically by the present government in terms of where we are heading with that most critical bilateral relationship. The white paper, at paragraph 23, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the spread of Australia's interests is wide, each of these interests is not equally important and nor can they be pursued with equal resource. Care is needed in setting priorities. The Asia&hyphen;Pacific is the region of highest foreign and trade policy priority for the government. Within the Asia&hyphen;Pacific, Australia's most 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7762"> substantial interests are with the region's three major powers and largest economies, the United States, Japan and China, and with our largest neighbour, Indonesia. Significant Australian interests are also engaged in our relationship with the Republic of Korea, the other ASEAN states and in the South Pacific, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The point I want to make as a result of that generalised statement is that I hope that, although Papua New Guinea comes last, that does not indicate our national priorities. I agree with the right honourable gentleman that one of our highest priorities, if not our highest, is that bilateral relationship with Papua New Guinea. To be fair, later in the same white paper, there is a very extensive coverage, in four paragraphs, of that bilateral relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line is the statement that a united, stable and prosperous PNG is of major Australian interest. That is the point to emphasise in terms of this debate and this report. Like the right honourable gentleman, I also agree that there are a lot of challenges for Papua New Guinea. There are challenges, particularly for the new Prime Minister, Bill Skate, whether they be in terms of the maintenance&mdash;or, some might say, the restoration&mdash;of parliamentary democracy or at least representative democracy or something else. There is no doubt that it is a very volatile society, and the Prime Minister will have his hands full in terms of the maintenance and, in fact, the sustenance of that parliamentary democracy with true representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those challenges are ahead of him. Of course, a large element of that is the maintenance of internal security, particularly on the island of Bougainville. From our very valuable briefings only a few days ago from Professor Ron May and Tony Regan from ANU, we got a different perspective. We get departmental and ministerial perspectives, but it is very healthy at times to get the perspective of people who are right on the ground. Both of those gentlemen, from different points of view, are across the issues of Papua New Guinea&mdash;in Ron May's case, particularly the election and the electoral consequences of what happened a few months ago; and in Tony Regan's case, particularly the Bougainville festering sore. I hope that the new Prime Minister takes up&mdash;and I am sure he will&mdash;the baton and charges all of those issues well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of Bougainville, I want to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the New Zealanders and to Minister MacKinnon&mdash;and, indeed, to our own foreign minister&mdash;in relation to their efforts in resolving what is a very difficult situation. But, as Mr Sinclair indicated, the aid package, $100 million over the next four years, will be only as good as Papua New Guinea makes it. And so it comes right back to Prime Minister Skate and his government, and the ability that they have to come to grips with all of the issues in their society&mdash;and, in particular, those that continue to fester out on Bougainville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to hold up this place any longer than I have to, because I know there are other speakers, other than to say that I hope that our government will take up and consider these recommendations. They are very well substantiated as a result of the seminar. In particular, I hope that both PNG and Bougainville, in relation to recommendation 14, which is the overarching recommendation for that bilateral relationship, will accept the consequences and the results of what was a most important seminar and what is, indeed, a most important report to the parliament of this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity today to speak in the debate on the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, their report being <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> . In doing so, it is appropriate to refer to the work of the equivalent committee in the last parliament with the production of the Beddall report. That provided excellent groundwork, and I understand that many of the outcomes of that report were well under way prior to the 1996 election. I would like to particularly take the opportunity to quote a couple of parts from the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On reading this report, and on discussing it with representatives of my community, the importance of the report has become increasingly apparent in relation to small business in the community being able to continue in a fair and proper fashion. I would like to quote from the foreword of the report. One part says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because it plays such a vital role, small business is a top priority for the Government. In particular the Government has committed itself to listen to the concerns of small business, to address those concerns and to subject its policies to a process of continuous improvement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After a detailed investigation, the Committee has concluded that concerns about unfair business conduct towards small business are justified, and should be addressed urgently. In an endeavour to find a balance towards fair trading in Australia, the Committee has recommended a number of specific measures, including legislation, to induce behavioural change on the part of big business towards smaller business, and to provide unfairly treated small businesses with adequate means of redress. These proposals will provide small business with a fair deal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These two quotes out of the foreword of the report, I believe, set the scene for what we hope will be a government response appropriate to those words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been much comment made from all sides of business and politics about the importance of small business in our economy and in the fight against unemployment. There is absolutely no doubt about that importance. The reality is quite clear. Much of our hope for employment opportunity is stored in our small business sector. That sector, however, cannot deliver if we do not give them the ground upon which to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fair trading inquiry recommendations provide an answer to the prayers of thousands of small businesses and their employees. The tough legislative action that it recommends is supported by the Labor Party. It has been common knowledge that small businesses&mdash;particularly in the retail, tenancy and franchise environment&mdash;have been badly treated by big business for a long time. However, the sheer extent of the problem has been starkly illustrated by this inquiry. I appreciate the concern and frustration felt by thousands of small businesses in Australia. It should be clear to anyone who reads this report that small business is struggling under the weight of market power abuse by big business. Many local small businesses in my electorate have spoken to me at length about that frustration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since taking the opportunity of circulating the recommendations to a very broad number of people operating smaller businesses and franchises within my electorate, I know that I have a regular attendance in my office each week during my constituency meetings of people from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7764"> small business. They want to come to explain and talk about the difficulties which they face and which they know can be addressed by the adoption of this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate of Namadgi&mdash;and Canberra as a whole&mdash;has many small businesses suffering severely under the current economic circumstances. The Canberra economy is struggling and we are desperately looking for signs of sustained recovery. It will happen and we know that. But what we do not know is when that recovery will occur. Canberra has faced and survived hard economic times in the past and we will recover eventually, due in no small part to the determination of our business people, and, particularly, our small businesses. But they need a fair go, a fair chance. This report offers them that fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business in the main is a family investment. These families put all their resources and energies into their business, with nothing other than an intention to succeed. Is it fair that oppressive or unconscionable behaviour by larger businesses is allowed to continue? No, it is not. It drives these people out of those businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The range of recommendations covered in this report are important to note. I will just very briefly outline them. They refer to the Trade Practices Act, retail tenancy, franchising, small business finance and access to justice and education in the main. The inquiry recommended many useful changes. However, the most important element is the legislative protection for small business through the Trade Practices Act. Without this, the implementation of the recommendations would be useless. I should point out here that prior to the inquiry the Labor Party had proposed such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My Labor parliamentarian colleagues and I fully support all of the recommendations, including legislative recommendations, because they are fair. We feel very strongly that, if small business can get some security and certainty, then employment growth will follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations in the report are essential for small business and must be implemented by the federal government. The committee chair, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), said in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfair conduct by big business towards small business is one such major concern. Indeed it has been a matter of grave concern for many years. Not only has such conduct the potential to impact heavily on the economic health of the small business sector, and on the allocation of resources generally, it can also involve heavy social costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We believe that what small business really wants above all else is a law that protects them from the misuse of market power by big business. Mr Rob Bastian, Chief Executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, described the need for it more than a year ago as `critical' and surpassing such matters as `deregulation and reduced paperwork'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Canberra, with the cutbacks to the Public Service and the subsequent flow&hyphen;on into our private sector, our businesses are really struggling. But they are not going to give up. Both the federal and the ACT Liberal governments have stated many times their expectation that the private sector will pick up the slack from the changes to the public sector. I have heard so many times that accordingly jobs will come from the private sector. Well, people in the private sector are trying, and I can assure you that that is not because the two Liberal governments concerned have suggested that they should, but because they happen to believe in Canberra, in the role of the national capital, and in the future of this city. But give them the real opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Discussion following the issuing of this report has been mainly in the retail area, and that is very understandable, given the very structure of that particular area of business. Another 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7765"> area that has a whole chapter&mdash;3.57, in fact&mdash;devoted to it in the report is that of petrol franchising and the outlets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had the opportunity in my work in the ACT over previous years&mdash;in another place&mdash;to participate in an inquiry into petrol pricing. What became incredibly obvious to me during that inquiry in another parliament was the absolute power that the oil companies had, and still have, over families operating franchises in petrol outlets. It has been absolutely outrageous. In fact, at one point, I was known to say, `Why would any family ever wish to enter such a business, given the overwhelming power by which they are held by the oil companies?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is good to see that quite a proportion of this report has referred to that particular area of business. I know that it is no secret to all members in this place, should they read the correspondence they get, that the Motor Trades Association has taken a very strong stand of support in relation to this report and wants to see it implemented on behalf of its membership as soon as possible. Regarding that sector, paragraph 3.78 from the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes again that a high level of concern has been expressed about the conduct of the major oil companies in their relationships with their franchisees and that those concerns have had a very long history. The Committee also notes that similar concerns have led to specific regulatory action in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is urgent for everybody&mdash;every group, family and individual&mdash;who operates within a small business sector in Australia to have this report adopted, unequivocally, as soon as possible and for the legislative requirements accompanying that to be enacted as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Adopt this report and implement the recommendations with no delay. Small businesses understand very well that, with the implementation of these recommendations, their opportunities for growth and for increased employment&mdash;their future, in fact&mdash;will improve immediately. So too will the economic future of this city and this region where I happen to be a parliamentary representative.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was our former great Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, who once so eloquently said that life was not meant to be easy. Political observers at the time put the reference down to the politics of the day. In the 1990s, it could well be applied to an individual, couple, family or partnership running their own small business. When we look back on the past, and to the wisdom of other men like the great late Sir Garfield Barwick who so recently passed away, we also think of a Liberal politician who first proposed the Trade Practices Act, which today is a critical piece of legislation in the protection of small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a new boy on the block in this parliament, and as a fresh face in the new federal coalition government, it is with a great deal of satisfaction that I present a report to this House on the inquiry into fair trading by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government honoured an important commitment it made to the small business community and to the people of Australia, before its election to office in March last year, by announcing on 26 June 1996 an inquiry into fair trading. In the federal coalition's policy document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A new deal for small business</EMPHASIS>, we committed ourselves to ensuring that the Trade Practices Act could respond to the working needs of the small business sector. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Monitoring of fair trading practices will be a priority issue. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7766">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is from this background and as a member of the committee that I support the overwhelmingly bipartisan recommendations brought down in the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> , on 26 May this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I offer no dissent to the final recommendations, and there is a simple reason for that. I support the broad thrust of those recommendations and what they seek to achieve. Unfair conduct by big business towards small business is a legitimate concern and needs to be addressed by this government, as it promised it would.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Assessing the need to restore the balance in retail tenancy and lease arrangements by way of a uniform retail tenancy code, underpinned by the Trade Practices Act, will help level the playing field that so many small business people have long felt needed to be done, and as they have proved during the hearings of this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three&hyphen;part recommendation dealing with franchising, the fastest growing sector in Australian small business today, is well warranted. The upside potential of owning a franchise has tantalised small businesses for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and with good reason. As Professor Andrew Terry said about franchising in evidence to the committee, and as it is quoted in the report on page 83:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is undoubtedly the most efficient, effective distribution system ever invented. It is the greatest invention of Western capitalism since the invention of the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yes, it has been, but that promise has been weakened by the pitfalls small business has succumbed to due to the limited protection provided under the present Franchising Code of Practice. The code is no saving grace for many hundreds of small business franchisees around the nation. It is time the rules and regulations pertaining to franchising matched the reality of the marketplace. I am encouraged by the inquiry's recommendations that seek to restore equity and balance, and the ethos of a fair go, in the area of franchising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have supreme faith in the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), who has done an unprecedented job in dragging our industrial relations system from the 19th century into the 21st century. The five significant recommendations of the fair trading report concerning fairness, equity, balance, and most of all, a fair go for small business, will be introduced effectively and in a sensible way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our community in general, and many small businesses in particular, greet our federal small business minister with the sounds of positive endorsement since the interests of small business are his interests. The confidence is there, and I have confidence that a better deal on fair trading for small business is around the corner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Peter Reith made a very successful trip to the Hunter and Paterson electorates on 30 July this year. At a business luncheon that was fitted in at Newcastle&mdash;Labor's heartland, its beating pulse, as they like to think it is&mdash;the minister saw first&hyphen;hand that the people expected something to be done, and that they expected it would be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fair trading report will go down in history as a report of great significance. It will not be a dust collector on a library shelf, as happens to so many good parliamentary reports despite their good intent and all the hours of work and all the resources that have gone into them. It will not be a report where people will say, `Tut tut, nice ideas, but let's put it aside for another time.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are several reasons for that. Firstly, the inquiry sought far and wide the views of small businesses and interested industry groups and individuals and hence the interest in its findings. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7767"> There is nothing unusual in that, but the submissions and expressions of support to the inquiry in most cases were second to none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business people in the Hunter were particularly well represented in the 198 submissions and a multitude of exhibits. I publicly offer my support of those people in the Hunter region, and in particular those who have prepared a case to see the Commonwealth foster a fairer and more equitable arrangement for enterprise and small business in this country and in its future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry report thanked the contribution made by a number of local people. These include Grahame Henderson, the national chairman of the Shell National Action Group and a local service station proprietor. He made two submissions and provided an exhibit for the inquiry. He has constantly contacted me over his concern about multi&hyphen;site franchising and the unconscionable conduct of Shell towards its franchisees and the reneging on its previous offers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other Hunter people to provide submissions in that inquiry viewed as not in&hyphen;confidence included Graham Poole, Chairman of the Retail Committee Small Business Association for the Hunter region; Vicki Holliday, the director of the Port Stephens Sand Company Proprietary Ltd; Great Cuts Hairdressing of Charlestown Square; Mr David Roskell; and Mr Bill Roberts, Vice&hyphen;President of the Hunter Small Business Persons Association, who gave evidence under the umbrella of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia. Of others, it was notable that Tim Luckhurst, Executive Director of the Australian Chicken Growers Council, also made a submission to the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been plenty written and said lately about the chicken industry in the Hunter, and a lot of hairy chest stuff from my political opponent, as if Labor had all the answers to the issue. I make the salient point on this: the former government was a part of the problem with the chicken industry and the ongoing debate over the importation of cooked chicken meat, so how can they be a part of the solution?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My strident stand against the importation of cooked chicken meat from the nations of Thailand, the United States and Denmark, which possess exotic diseases such as the virulent Newcastle disease, is well&hyphen;known. I publicly again reiterate my wholehearted opposition to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My second point reiterates an important point I highlighted earlier. The government has categorically stated that it will take the findings on board, and will respond in no set timetable but now likely to be some time this month. Indeed, only yesterday the minister addressed both the urgency and the importance of the fair trading report to the coalition members of this parliament. The response to the report will not be locked away in the bottom drawer, so let us not have any of this talk about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the report is also unusual in that for the first time a federal government&mdash;that being the Howard government&mdash;elected in part on the back of small business support, is showing a leadership role in the important areas of retail tenancy and unfair and unconscionable business conduct. That is an important step that reflects the Commonwealth's ability to readdress policy to suit the times with small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a government that speaks from upon high and then expects people to be boxed around the ears by the message. It is a government prepared to offer some spine of solid lasting support for small business where it can. It is a government that is prepared and is delivering a fairer go for small business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7768">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back on 5 August, the Hunter based small business people in Newcastle held a public debate over the fair trading report, with the respective members of the inquiry addressing Hunter businesses on their desire for a fair go over fair trading. I was there with my colleague, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), the member for Newcastle (Mr Morris), the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin)&mdash;Labor's opposition small business spokesman&mdash;and the Democrats' business spokesperson, Senator Andrew Murray. You might call that a star&hyphen;studded cast, but there was plenty of pulpit thumping there. All took up the fight for a better deal for small business. I hope that show of support carries through to other policy areas that assist in enterprise and foster growth and job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, as I pointed out to this House last week, a fair go for small business for Labor and the Democrats does not extend to relief from unfair dismissal provisions; a fair go for small business did not include a balanced budget that has driven rates down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fair go for small business includes exemption from fringe benefits tax from 1 April 1997 for car parking; capital gains tax rollover relief on the sale of small business for retirement and the sale of shares in small business, and a new apprenticeship system more attractive for small businesses to take on new apprentices and trainees. With my own eyes on the stage, I watched them state how they would fight for small business and drag the government towards fully endorsing bipartisan findings on the fair trading inquiry&mdash;an inquiry I add that this government actually created and instigated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Senator Murray and the member for Cunningham, rightly, want the fish and chip outlet, the clothes shop in a shopping centre and the fruito next door to a supermarket to get a fair go on fair trading, but, it seems, nowhere else. Those fighting words do not carry through to providing some valid relief from unfair dismissal provisions for these very same businesses, and supporting them in actually employing people. That is the point I want to ram home hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian business climate, whilst it offers many opportunities, offers some harsh realities. As a nation, Australia is the world leader in square metres of retail space per head of population. That is a pretty scaring statistic. In Australia as a nation, it is generally accepted and not disputed that of every 10 new businesses that open their doors, only one will still be trading after five years&mdash;because of retirement, new opportunities, not earning enough dollars, whatever the reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a nation, for much of the past two or so decades we have had governments&mdash;federal, state and local&mdash;which have lived beyond their means, and business has paid the penalty through higher taxes, charges and interest rates. I understand very much where small business is coming from. For all the breast beating I hear from my political opponents, this government is proud to build a working partnership with the small business community. As a former small businessman myself, in the water sports business, I experienced the hard knocks as well as the pleasures, the individual freedoms, the ability to carve out your life for a period as a small business person. Sure, it is never easy. Successes do not follow you with every turn, and there are plenty of pitfalls on the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a current political representative, in July 1996&mdash;as promised during the campaign&mdash;I held a very successful small business summit, hosting the then small business minister, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), and including speakers of the calibre of John Farragher, representing the Hunter small business persons, and Dr Wej Paradice from the Hunter Valley Research Foundation. I have taken on board the great feedback and ideas I got from it, and continue to get, particularly with the recent Hunter visit by the new small business minister, a man of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7769"> great reputation for getting things done&mdash;the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line is this. We would always like the economy to be a bit better; our customers to be more friendly, with conditions more conducive to their spending; our creditors to pay us on time; the impost of council rates and other charges to be less. What we need now is new corridors of opportunity to be opened. What we need in this country is quite simply a fair go for small businesses to get on with what they do best: creating wealth and employing people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For political scientists in the future, particularly following the speech we have just heard, there will be some really fascinating things to study about the Howard government. One is the way that it seems to take things for granted. Another is the way that it seems to feel that if you say something often enough it will become a fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the last election, older Australians were solid supporters of the coalition. But since he became Prime Minister, John Howard has not missed an opportunity to betray that trust. He has cut older Australians' access to dental care, restricted hearing services and restricted the full range of drugs they need, and is making them sell their homes if they need to get into a nursing home. That is as far as it goes for older people and the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we are talking about small business. On jobs and the economy the government keeps saying, `Things will get better,' and `Just wait a few months.' Meanwhile, its only proactive moves are to continue to cut government services and assistance across the board. Probably most blatant and most astounding of all is the way this government has treated small business&mdash;in particular, small retailers.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SLIPPER" NAMEID="0V5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V5">Mr Slipper</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very well.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PG6">Ms MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite say that it is very well. When I give them a few details, in a few minutes, they may change their tune. Small business is acknowledged by the opposition as well as by the government to be the engine room of the economy and a critical factor in job creation. We know that the preferred option of the Prime Minister when it comes to job creation is to go down the American road and cut wages. Let me tell the Prime Minister and those opposite that, for many small retailers in the electorate of Jagajaga, this is just not an option. Let us look at why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks to the way this government has handled the economy, generally, and the way it has handled the environment in which small retailers have to work, specifically, many small retailers are doing it so hard that they cannot afford to employ any staff at all. Most are now in a situation where it is husband, wife and kids working around the clock just to keep things going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister might skite about the record number of interest rate cuts which have had to occur because of the appalling state the economy is in, but the local retailers are telling us that interest rate cuts are having a zero effect on their businesses. People who live in Jagajaga shop at either of the two large shopping centres: Northland, which is actually in the neighbouring electorate of Batman, or Greensborough, which is on the border of Jagajaga and Scullin. Otherwise they shop in a variety of retail strip shopping centres scattered throughout the electorate. All of the retailers are having difficulties, thanks to the policies of this government, which are exacerbated by the policies of their coalition colleague, but not friend, Jeff Kennett.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7770">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I will here focus on the problems of the retailers in the larger centres rather than the strip shopping centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Australian retailers, including those locally, are struggling to cope with the difficulties caused by a flat economy and a lack of consumer confidence. That is what this government has created. Victorian retailers have the additional problems caused by the Kennett government's push to a seven days a week, 24 hours a day trading regime, coupled with the wholesale expansion of gambling. The former&mdash;the 24 hours, seven days a week trading&mdash;stretches the resources of small retailers just to keep trading, while gambling has been well documented in its adverse impact on retail spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But at least many strip retailers have a choice about their hours of operation. For the retailers in the large centres, even that choice is taken away from them. They also face constantly increasing rents and government charges. Those opposite might go out into some of their large retail shopping centres and hear about the 300 to 500 per cent increases in rents that are occurring in the large shopping centres, certainly in my electorate. Lacking the clout of the big chains, many of the small retailers in these shopping centres are unable to get good deals on other things as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is hardest for them to bear is the callous and indifferent attitude of the centre managements. At Northland we have had renovations that started in February and will continue until the end of the year with devastating impacts for the passing trade. Centre managements seem to be indifferent to the problems: they just want the rent. In fact, they want the rent and they want no rocking of the boat. When Steve Price from local radio station 3AW, a Victorian radio station, visited Northland recently to talk to small retailers, he was followed everywhere by five centre security guards who noticed every retailer he visited. The message of intimidation was clear. In both centres, in Northland and in Greensborough, large numbers of retailers are simply closing the doors and walking away from their businesses. But this is after they have broken their bank balances and often their health and spirit in trying to keep their businesses running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasingly one hears of small retailers mortgaging their homes, taking extra loans just to keep going and then losing the lot. These people are being crushed by big business landlords, the mates of this government, who until recently really rubbed salt into the wounds of small retailers by having as a small business minister a person who himself was a shopping centre landlord. That was a message clearly understood by small retailers. The Howard government is a government for big business, for the top end of town, and has no interest in small business except to try to get their votes at election time. Where is this government's vision for small business? Nothing sums it up better than a comparison of the election promise to reduce red tape for small business and the recent proposals to introduce a GST. A GST involves a massive amount of extra red tape and paperwork and turns all small businesses into tax collectors for this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fair trading inquiry recommendations are a big step in the right direction for helping small retailers. The tough legislative action recommended by the inquiry is supported by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are committed to implementing the recommendations of the fair trading inquiry and believe that this, coupled with our small business policy principles, will go some way to helping the very difficult situation that many small retailers find themselves in. The report takes economic growth seriously through government assistance rather than blind adherence to market economics, which, of course, we see from the Treasurer (Mr Costello). It supports 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7771"> protection for small business against unfair trading through government monitoring of franchise arrangements. It supports protection of the small business against the large one, and making big business pay a fair share of taxation. It supports greater supervision of banks and the finance sector generally to help small businesses, who are often at a disadvantage. There is a greater recognition of the needs of the regions and specific programs to assist them, and there is support for the creation of a workplace atmosphere of reciprocal obligation between small retailers and their employees. These can be summarised as fair service and fair treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a stage in the process of helping small retailers with their problems and shaping Labor's policies for the future, I am going to be sponsoring a forum for small retailers in Heidelberg in the north&hyphen;east of Melbourne next week. Stephen Martin, our shadow minister for small business, and Lisa Michaels, the president of United Retailers&mdash;who I must say have been tireless in their efforts for small business&mdash;will be attending the forum. I look forward to hearing the views of small business and small retailers in the electorate so that we can bring to this parliament some serious ways of improving the plight that these people find themselves in.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must acknowledge the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), and acknowledge that many of the things she said are true. However, I point out that two issues are fairly critical. Firstly, small business has been doing it tough for a long time&mdash;probably for at least 13 years or more under the previous Labor government. You have to ask yourself what they actually did for small business, and my answer is: not a lot. It took courage to go out and find where the problems are in the small business community, and the Reid report, as an example of finding a way through to the solutions, is going a long way to address those problems that have been created and built up over a number of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the Reid report, released for public comment in May of this year, has gone a long way in bringing to light the inequalities and anti&hyphen;competitive behaviour of many players in the marketplace. This has been an ongoing problem. There have been two previous reports acknowledging the concerns of small business that have never seen the light of day. We have to commend the standing committee for their efforts in bringing to light the problems that are existing today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a Balance</EMPHASIS> is, in effect, the action that needs to be taken to overcome unfair practices and anti&hyphen;competitive behaviour as practised by many market traders. For too long small traders and a range of businessmen and women have been operating at a distinct disadvantage in an almost David and Goliath scenario. Unfair trading practices, franchising, retail tenancy and small business finance were the areas addressed as vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. The recommendations came after many months of inquiry from the length and breadth of the Australian marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After reading the full document, the findings of which have taken nearly 20 years to surface, I found that many of the cases highlighted were strangely familiar. Wherever you go in Australia, small business operators suffer similar consequences due to the lack of a national or uniform body of precedents that could deal with unfair conduct or anti&hyphen;competitive behaviour. Action is what is recommended. What action is to be the definitive exercise of the government response? Action in the form of a legislative response is also recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report recommends that the success of legislative protection will require vigorous enforcement. How this will come about is still in the process of distillation. What are the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7772"> circumstances that have brought us all to this point? Every elected representative in this House would have an active and working appreciation of how business is conducted in this country. We are all shoppers and purchasers of goods and services. The day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day situations and circumstances of small business operators are unique when you think that they have to get up each day and face the prospect of either making some income or, in many cases, no income. But they have to put food on the table at night, pay the bills and look hopefully towards the next day of either more of the same or an improvement in their day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day ritual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These recommendations, on the whole, address for the first time issues out of the control of the small businessman and businesswoman. This report shows the flaws that have existed for many years in areas such as a tenancy code. The recommendations aim towards the drafting of a uniform tenancy code. This should not be such a hard thing to do, particularly in light of the fact that so many national bodies currently exist whose aims are the best interests of tenants, who are, in effect, small businessmen and businesswomen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Groups such as the Property Council of Australia, the Australian Retailers Association, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Council of Business Organisations of Australia and its constituent bodies, and other retail associations, including the United Retailers Association Incorporated&mdash;and there are more&mdash;would all benefit from the concept of a uniform retail tenancy code. All retailers around Australia share a common workplace environment. The fact that there is this homogeneity of workplaces quite naturally lends itself to establishing a uniform code of business practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Bowman I have at least six major shopping centres, with another in the process of being built. In every one of those you will find stories of hardship caused by the unfair or anti&hyphen;competitive behaviour of the landlord or centre manager. One such case occurred recently where a tenant was denied the opportunity to sell his business. The business was turning a good profit but, because of family pressures, he decided to sell up. He found a buyer. The centre manager was happy with the deal. It was a win&hyphen;win situation: the seller was happy, the buyer was happy, the centre manager was happy. But, for some strange reason, the landlord was not. He decided the sale would not go ahead because the seller's contract still had 18 months to run. As a result, this man's life has been destroyed. He is in the process of a divorce. His business is suffering, as is his health, and all because of the ridiculous tenancy laws we are currently working under.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another problem facing tenants is the uncertainty of location. On more than one occasion I have had shopping centre tenants contact me complaining that they have been shifted for no apparent reason. The member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), in tabling this report, alluded to similar problems. He gave the example of small businesses being compulsorily relocated away from the shop for which they had negotiated a lease, with no rights of appeal and no compensation for loss of goodwill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take as an example a situation where you are setting up a new store. The shopping centre has just been refurbished and this has included a new major chain store. You decide to take up a position in the vicinity of the major retailer because of the increased traffic flow and potential for increased trade. You put everything you own on the line and spend considerable time and effort in building up a clientele. All of a sudden, the centre manager tells you that your shop is being relocated to another part of the centre. Regardless of the new site, you have lost a huge advantage in that you now have to hope that your customers can find you. Why? Because the manager has done a deal with a new tenant to get them into the centre.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7773">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area touched on by the report is that of justice for small business. At present, if a small business has a problem, it can be very difficult and often far too costly for them to fight the matter through the courts, particularly when banks are concerned. Banks will invariably win a battle with small business simply because they can continue to pour money into a problem until it goes away. One business I know had a very strong case against a bank; in fact, it was considered that the business would succeed. Unfortunately, the bank was able to prolong the case long enough to wear down the business operator. The bank knew it was at fault but it also knew it would eventually win because it had more resources at its disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the balance could only be shifted in favour of small business, we would probably see a decrease in the number of cases brought before the courts. Banks and major companies would realise they are required to fight on a level playing field, and would think twice about their actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we cannot deny that a number of problems facing small business are self&hyphen;inflicted. In the mid to late 1980s there was a boom in small businesses. People were encouraged to use their redundancies to start businesses with little or no knowledge of what they were getting into. Those who were not devastated by the Labor induced recession are today just clinging on to their businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these problems could have been avoided with a little forethought and planning. It is another recommendation of this report that improved small business education be provided. It has been suggested that this could be provided through chambers of commerce, trade associations or local and state government bodies. I must acknowledge the good work of the state government in Queensland in assisting small business operators in their business management. I have a very good working relationship with the Office of Business and Industry, and their activities are very helpful in assisting small businesses with their decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, a little training can go a long way to create a successful business enterprise; and for every business that fails there is a domino effect on the rest of the economy. If that business has staff, they are out of work, the suppliers to that business lose out due to a decrease in sales, and the customer suffers from a loss of competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, business people are not looking for handouts. They do not want the government to come along and hand them profits on a plate. In fact, all of the business people I talk to want governments to butt out, to stop interfering and let them get on with business. But to do this they need some sort of level playing field where everyone is equal. I am not talking about the level playing field that Paul Keating was so fond of. I do not believe that exists, at least not at this point in time. What I am referring to is an environment where businesses, both big and small, can coexist in relative harmony; an environment in which they can conduct their business in a competitive yet fair way. I believe the recommendations in this report would achieve this environment, and I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know, in May this year the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology tabled its long awaited report on fair trading in Australia, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS> . The report, which is a credit to all committee members, was unfortunately overtaken by events.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the report's positive and much needed reform agenda, the recommendations still await a formal response from the Howard government. This government, which at every opportunity proclaims its concern for small business, committed itself to a formal response 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7774"> within three months of the report being tabled. Last week that self&hyphen;imposed deadline for a formal response passed but, instead of seeing the formal government response, we saw the new Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) postpone one until the end of this month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no need for further consultations. The committee was made up of members of all parties and, irrespective of their political affiliation, they unanimously recommended a positive legislation reform agenda to protect small business. We all know how badly needed that is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that endlessly frustrates me is hearing this government parroting the line about bipartisan support on a range of issues. We hear minister after minister&mdash;and a few backbenchers too, like the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford)&mdash;looking earnestly into the television camera lens saying, `Wouldn't it be great if we had the support of the Australian Labor Party on this issue?' Then they reel off a list of issues that they want bipartisan support on&mdash;their much&hyphen;vaunted tax reform, native title, the constitutional convention or drugs. Yet, when the support of the Australian Labor Party is announced and committed publicly, as it is on this report and its recommendations, this government does a sprint to hide, and those very same earnest looking ministers and backbenchers baulk at taking action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let it be clear: Labor supports each of the recommendations contained in this fair trading report. Since the report was tabled in May, I, along with my Labor party colleagues, have been getting these recommendations around to small business and to the local chambers of commerce in electorates. For my part, I have talked with all of the chambers of commerce in my electorate. I have talked with small business operators, and I have responded to their letters and telephone calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of weeks ago, my parliamentary colleague the shadow minister for small business, the honourable Stephen Martin, and I met with small business operators at Shellharbour Square in my electorate&mdash;a shopping centre currently undergoing millions of dollars worth of expansion&mdash;to discuss this report. I met with representatives of the Motor Traders Association in my office at Albion Park Rail and also with another group in my office here in Canberra, to discuss the report. I have issued media releases indicating my own support and, indeed, the Labor Party's support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bipartisan support that the government hungers for is here on this issue&mdash;that is, fair trading legislative protection for small business. I cannot understand why this government needs to postpone a formal response to this report and its recommendations until the end of the month. Quite frankly, when Labor was in office, if we had achieved bipartisan support on this issue, we would have grabbed the support with both hands. We certainly would not have called for it endlessly and then, once given it, baulked at the chance to take some action. Let us hear no further excuses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business should forget the postponed deadline and come into the House today and tell small business operators stuck in shopping centres that he knows and understands that they are being treated unfairly and oppressively by big business. The minister should come into the House today and tell small business operators that the big business abuse of their market power is over. He should come into the House today aware that there is unprecedented joint political support for the protection of small operators, through legislation, from unfair conduct. Come into the House today, Minister, and put to rest once and for all the anxious minds of small business operators in shopping centres.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7775">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let the minister come in and tell small business operators that this parliament agrees that big businesses in the form of shopping centres, large retail chains and franchisors have been using their overwhelming market power to squeeze the life from small business. It is somewhat of a fashion for members of the government to come into the chamber and say that they never receive any negative complaints from their constituency about a range of issues and decisions. Small business operators in my electorate have welcomed this report and its recommendations, and they have urged that it be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has the blueprint in this report. The message from small business is: implement the recommendations in full; amend the Trade Practices Act to proscribe unfair conduct; give the ACCC enhanced powers to take action for small business facing unfair trading in the marketplace; draft a national uniform retail tenancy code to be adopted throughout Australia; enact Commonwealth franchising legislation covering all franchise arrangements; include small business in the Australian banking industry ombudsman scheme; improve small business access to legal tribunals for commercial disputes; and improve small business education. The previous speaker spoke about this, and I agree entirely with the comments that she made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has a habit of having to be dragged kicking and screaming to the point of making decisions. This was the case in the response following the Productivity Commission report into the automotive industry. At the end, the strategy Labor promoted was implemented. I suspect that the same situation will apply again to the response to the latest commission report on the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. Labor has promoted this strategy, and the government will implement it. Likewise, Labor has promoted the fair trading report and we support the recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has not come to terms with the task of governing. It is time that the Australian community&mdash;and its small business sector&mdash;was given some relief from this misery. Again, I congratulate all involved in the compiling of this report. I thought it was an excellent report. I just hope that it will be implemented in full.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about the Beddall report?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Beddall report, which I have here, is really the coup de grace for the Labor Party in terms of its support for small business. There is considerable irony in this. The chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology that brought down this report was none other than the deputy chairman of the current committee, David Beddall&mdash;hence the Beddall report. I was quite interested in the Beddall report. I came to the parliament in 1990 and the report came down early in 1990. At the time, I had had a considerable amount of experience in small business&mdash;in the retail industry in particular. The Beddall report actually brought forward a large number of recommendations, the vast majority of which would have been very advantageous to the small business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the government of the day, the Labor government, simply did not deal with it. It was not a matter of a month's delay&mdash;which the member for Throsby now stands up and complains about. The Labor Party almost totally failed to react to the recommendations that were made 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7776"> by the so&hyphen;called Beddall committee. I do not remember how many recommendations there were; there were certainly a large number. As I recall&mdash;and I am sure the member from the Labor Party will put me right if I am wrong&mdash;most of them were not adopted. Many of them would have been of significant advantage to the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think that opposition members can come in here and speak with any credibility on the issue of small business. They not only had the Beddall report before them back in 1990 but they also had 13 years in which to address many of the issues which they are now supporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To pick up the point the member for Throsby made, a response was promised within three months of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS> report coming down. A very reasonable rationale was put forward for the slight delay: we had a change of minister in the meantime. To his credit, the new minister wanted to put his own stamp on the report. Obviously, it required a delay of some time to do that. The important thing is that the government's response would be very carefully considered and it would not be, as the honourable member for Throsby is suggesting, some sort of a knee&hyphen;jerk response. I do not know whether the opposition's position in the end is that, as the member for Throsby says, `They will accept every recommendation in this report.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that the government can do that. Without wanting to be critical of this very good report, there are obviously some elements of it where I think the hurdle has been set too high for the government. I think the Labor Party, in due course, given the opportunity to reflect carefully upon the report, will realise that that is so. Again, without being too critical of my colleague Bruce Reid who chaired the committee, I need to say&mdash;because I have had a lot of involvement in these issues&mdash;that there are two distinct sides to the story on most of these issues. I am talking here particularly about some of the matters that are raised early in the report, about retail tenancy matters. We need to give careful consideration to those recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I came to this parliament, and going back many years, my involvement in the retail industry&mdash;in particular, the shopping centre industry&mdash;gave me a very good understanding. When I first went into shopping centres with retail businesses in the early days of shopping centres, there was a very good relationship between shopping centre owners and the retailers. There was a true partnership. That was the whole basis for the whole regional shopping centre industry in the United States in the first place, and subsequently in Australia. Over the years, for one reason or another, that partnership tended to break down. There was blame on both sides for the breakdown of that particular partnership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt, and I said it before I came to this place and I will say it again here today, that some shopping centre owners were quite rapacious in the sorts of activities that they conducted, and some of those are dealt with in this report. But, by the same token, I can now say&mdash;from my position here rather than as a retailer&mdash;that I think there are a number of retailers also that did not conduct themselves in a way that brought a great deal of credit to their particular industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The name of the report is a very good one. That is really the challenge in this issue, and that is to find a balance which will be in the interests of both sides. The retailers do have a lot to complain about, but I think in the end we need to be very careful that we do not impact strongly on investor confidence&mdash;after all, it costs a lot of money. Some of the landlords are small business people themselves. The major ones we are talking about are very substantial 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7777"> Australian businesses. But I think the balance that we need to bring into this argument is to make sure that we do not intrude too much or that we do not overregulate a marketplace that by and large, with some obvious deficiencies, works very well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A massive rip&hyphen;off!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the member for Throsby in that sense being enamoured with all of these recommendations. Essentially he comes from a party which one would think would be philosophically disposed to regulation. The fact is that the government has a broader interest and a broader responsibility, and that is to ensure that there is a balance in the particular arguments we are having.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the issues that are covered in the report in relation to landlord and retail tenancy matters are important. There are dispute resolutions and security of tenure, and lease assignment has always been a bone of contention. Rents and rent reviews have always been difficult. The payment of outgoings and promotions has always been a difficult issue. Issues relating to tenancy mix have always been bones of contention. None of the things that are covered in this report is new, but essentially they do represent a challenge for the government to find a balance ultimately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why, to answer the member for Throsby's question, we cannot rush into some knee&hyphen;jerk response to a report which, after all, is coloured, as any parliamentary report will be, by the sort of input that the committee had. I was not on the committee, but I know, having been on the other side and seen it, that there would have been retailers who came before this committee and told the committee&mdash;quite properly and, from their own experience&mdash;quite vividly how a landlord had driven them to the point where they had lost their homes or even where there were suicides involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in the end we are dealing with a system in this country based on free enterprise, based on our commitment to allowing markets to work effectively and based on our belief that competition does bring about the best results. That does not mean that we do not give to the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission the sorts of powers that it needs to make sure, particularly in a marketplace like Australia which is small in terms of the population of Australia, that competition is there and there is not a misuse of market power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly in negotiations between landlords and tenants there is the potential for misuse of market power, abuse of market power. A small retailer trying to negotiate with a giant Westfield or a giant Lend Lease or any one of the major shopping centre owners is going to suffer from an imbalance of market power. But that does not necessarily mean that that power is being misused or abused. But ultimately, of course, in any market situation there will be a tendency for that to happen where there is an imbalance in market power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government has a challenge on its hands in dealing with the recommendations of this report. The Labor Party has the luxury of being in opposition. Obviously the member for Throsby, who listens to his constituents, particularly his retail ones, and some of the retail organisations and small business organisations will be saying, `The solution to all of our problems is to just simply implement this report lock, stock and barrel.' But, Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure you that the government, if it does its job properly, as I am sure it is doing, will not do that and it will give very careful consideration to the wider implications of that report. For the sake of the small business community, we need to get it right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the last election, this government made overtures to the small business community and indicated our belief, philosophically, that we have a strong commitment to the small 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7778"> business community. Many people on our side came from the small business community, so we understand it. We empathise with it. That, of course, contrasts us quite markedly with the Labor Party, where very few of their members actually know very much about how business operates in real terms. But the fact is we created an expectation. When we came into government, I think, in fairness, we found the job of turning this economy round rather more difficult than we expected it might be. But we have done a lot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response to this report is only one part of a commitment that this government will demonstrate to small business. Some of the things that we have done, we have spelt out quite clearly. But our priority has to be to create in this country the right climate for strong economic growth, and ultimately, that is what is going to be of benefit not only to small business but also to business more broadly which ultimately will lead to the solution of the biggest problem we have in this country, and that is unemployment. There is no alternative but to go on with the reform started by the Labor Party&mdash;I acknowledge that was the case in many respects&mdash;to press the pace of reform as strongly as we can in microeconomic reform and tax reform and to press on with our industrial relations reforms, which the member for Throsby foremost in the Labor Party would die in the ditches to prevent. But we need to press on with those reforms if the Australian economy is to move forward. That will be the solution to the problems faced by small business in this country. There are no easy solutions and, in their saner moments, the Labor Party members who have spoken about the government's inactivity, et cetera, know that there are no such things as free lunches&mdash;</PARA>

Yesterday we put in place another important part of the jigsaw as far as the small business community is concerned. I would like to congratulate the Treasurer for the government's response to the Wallis committee's report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Actually, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS> report deals in some detail with the capital requirements of small business. I am not entirely a bank basher, but we all engage in that from time to time. I have no doubt that the small business community has paid heavily for the excesses of the banks through the 1980s and continues to do so. The anecdotal evidence I am getting from the small business community in my electorate, which is doing it really tough because the tourist industry is not as buoyant as it was, is that some of them are still being expected to pay overdraft rates of interest of between 11 and even up to penalty rates of 15 per cent. One of the biggest benefits that we can bring to small business is increased competition in the banking sector. The government's response to the Wallis committee report will ensure that that occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice from reading Terry McCrann in today's paper that the Labor Party has apparently indicated by the comments of the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), the shadow treasurer, yesterday that they will support, by and large, the government's response to the Wallis committee report in its implementation. I will quote Terry McCrann on this, because this is the crunch line:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A cautionary note though. Just because Gareth&hyphen;Gareth says something certainly does not make it so. If he was able to lead Labor's economic policy from his intellect rather than Kim Beazley's cynical hypocrisy, we would be well on the way to a GST.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) and (2) The Archives Act 1983 provides that Commonwealth records should be made publicly available when they reach thirty years of age (often known as the open access period). Most Commonwealth records in the open access period are made publicly available. A small number are not released either partially or wholly because they require exemption for longer than thirty years in accordance with categories specified in the Archives Act. These categories provide for the exemption of material that might, for example, jeopardise national security, prejudice international relations or be an unreasonable disclosure of information relating to the personal affairs of an individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of public concern, the then Minister for Defence, the Rt Hon Ian Sinclair MP, announced in December 1982 that Commonwealth records identified as documenting the use of herbicides by Australia were to be made available immediately. The records to be made available were held by the Australian War Memorial and were aggregated into a series known as the Herbicide series, Vietnam (AWM 181). This series, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which contains some records relevant to the Dapsone trials, has been available since the early 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Records about Dapsone are held in series other than the Herbicide series, Vietnam. The earliest of these records (those from 1964 and 1966) documenting the Dapsone trials (1956&hyphen;1973), most of which are held by the Australian War Memorial, are now in the open period. Researchers may request that these be examined for access. The latest of the Dapsone trails records (dated to 1972) will move into the open period in 2002.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also material associated with the Evatt Royal Commission. Mr Justice Evatt inquired into the Effects on Australian Personnel of the Chemical Agents used in Vietnam. The transcripts and reports of this Commission have been available since the release of the Evatt Royal Commission in 1985 which found it was possible that Dapsone could cause cancer. He recommended that the Federal Government should fund studies into the carcinogenicity of Dapsone.In response to this recommendation, the then Government funded research into the possibility that Dapsone could cause cancer. The major part of this research was completed in 1992, and was released by the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs early in that year. The study found no definite evidence that Dapsone resulted in cancer at any site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government at that time arranged for the report to be printed and distributed widely. The main report is now out of stock, but I have arranged for the Executive Summary of that Report to be placed on the Department of Veterans' Affairs Home Page on the Internet (http://www. dva.gov.au/). The full report is available from libraries, and I have sent a copy of the Executive Summary to the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beyond this, there is the broad range of medical research that continues into drugs, such as Dapsone.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Received: 26 AUG 1997</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Thomson</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing in response to your questions without notice of 25 August 1997 on the subject of Mr Max Moore-Wilton's meeting with the JS McMillan printing consortium.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Moore-Wilton met with representatives of JS McMillan Pty Ltd, including Dr Hewson, at their request on 16 July. The Secretary meets with many people in the course of his normal duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The meeting followed a decision by the Federal Court against J S McMillan Pty Ltd and in favour of the Commonwealth, in which the judge found, nevertheless, that the Commonwealth had misled the consortium in failing to provide full information in the tender. The judge expressed a desire that the Commonwealth remedy the situation. I have attached the relevant portions of the Federal Court's judgement for your information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Moore-Wilton subsequently wrote to the Secretary of DAS on l? July advising that in view of the importance the government places on clear and fair processes, and the judge's criticism, there would be merit in considering recommencing the tender process. I am attaching a copy of Mr Moore Wilton's letter for your information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any event, immediately after the judgement was handed down, I am advised that the option of reopening tenders was already under consideration by DAS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no interference in the tender process and I regard Mr Moore Wilton's contribution as timely and proper.

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"JS McMillan has remained non-compliant in that they confirmed their inability to accept the specif c terms and conditions of section 10.5 at page 29 of the RFT This matter is considered a fundamental term and condition that underpins the philosophy and strategy of the RFTi.e. to deliver services at the same terms and conditions including prices in accordance with the MOUs. While JS McMillan has made the claim that it should not be assumed that their failure to agree to these terms will result in higher prices, the Committee did not ask for pricing structures that would return lower or higher prices. The Committee considers the JS McMillan bid to be non-compliant and as such can not be considered further"</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two comments which can be made in relation to that observation. The first, and most important, is that there is nowhere to be found in the Request for Tender a statement that the terms and conditions of section 10.5 are a fundamental term and condition that underpins the philosophy and strategy of the Request for Tender.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second is that the Committee's view that, because the bid is non-compliant, it "can not be considered further" does not appear to be reflected in the Request for Tender. For example, included in the Request for Tender is a section entitled "Tender Evaluation Criteria" which is, relevantly, in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"1.1 In assessing tenders (including the best and final offers from the short-listed tenders), the Evaluation Committee will consider such other criteria it considers to be in the best interest of the Commonwealth. In assessing the tender the criteria that will be used will include the following:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) prices tendered;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) capability of tenderers to successfully operate the business described in each Package. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) any potential for creating a conflict of interest with other commercial activities of the tenderer; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7794">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) the views of Client Departments;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">the extent to which </EMPHASIS> the tenderers meet the requirements of this Request For Tender;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) developing and implementing innovative information solutions. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.2 The above criteria are not necessarily in order of priority or of equal weight."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[My emphasis]</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, a tenderer may be excused for assuming that non-compliance with the Request for Tender in some respects would not necessarily be fatal to being short listed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether or not Mr McMillan would have given an unequivocal assurance of acceptance of clauses 10.5 and 10.7 is a matter in issue and I shall deal with it below. However, in so far as the decision to short list was made on the basis that acceptance of the specific terms and conditions of section 10.5 was a fundamental term and condition that underpins the philosophy and strategy of the Request to Tender and on the basis that non acceptance of those specific terms and conditions rendered a tender non-compliant such that it <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">could not </EMPHASIS> be considered further, the Request for Tender did not fairly reflect the manner in which tenderers would be dealt with. As I have said above, tenderers could be excused for assuming that it was not fundamental to acceptance of a tender that there be an unconditional acceptance of clauses 10.5 and 10.7.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To that extent I consider that the conduct of the Commonwealth has been misleading. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the two other issues which are raised by the Commonwealth, namely whether Mr McMillan would have acted differently if he had been told of those two matters and whether the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> Trade Practices Act</EMPHASIS>  applies to the conduct in question in any event.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD" FONT-SLANT="ITAL">DID McMILLAN SUFFER LOSS OR DAMAGE BY THE COMMONWEALTH'S CONDUCT?</EMPHASIS> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">McMillan in substance seeks relief under s 87 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> Trade Practices Act</EMPHASIS> . Section 87 relevantly provides that where, in a proceeding instituted under Part VI, the Court finds that a person who is a Trade Practices Act applicable. That does not appear to me to have been the intention of s 2A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament was intending to limit the extent to which the Commonwealth would be bound by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade Practices Act</EMPHASIS> . It could have chosen the same touchstone as is chosen for s 52, namely conduct engaged in in trade or commerce. It did not. Rather the Parliament chose to limit the application of the Act to the Commonwealth, in so far as it carries on a business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I consider that that expression signifies that the Commonwealth is to be bound only where the conduct complained of is engaged in, in the course of carrying on the business. In other words, persons 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dealing with the Commonwealth in relation to the actual conduct of a business will have the same protection as when dealing with a private trader who is carrying on such a business but will not have protection when entering into other dealings with the Commonwealth. That appears to me to be consistent with the reason for the introduction of s 2A as explained by the Minister on the Second Reading of the Bill for the amendment which introduced s 2A (Australia, House of Representatives, Debates 3 May 1977, p 1447) as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"Government Commercial Operations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I announced last December that the Government had decided in principle that its commercial operations should be subject to the same restraints of the Trade Practices Act as apply to like operations of private enterprise. I then informed this House that the Government was studying the detailed implementation of this decision. This Bill gives effect to that decision in clause 4 which provides that the Act is to apply to all business undertakings of the Commonwealth Government and its authorities."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conduct of the Commonwealth in issuing the Request for Tender and in dealing with prospective tenderers was not activity engaged in in carrying on the business which has hitherto been carried on by the Commonwealth, in the guise of the DAS, under the name AGPS. The conduct complained of is that of officers of the Commonwealth who have had nothing to do with the day to day operations of the AGPS. It is conduct quite divorced from the carrying on of that business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While some entities might be thought to engage in the business of selling capital assets, it was not contended by McMillan that the Commonwealth is engaged in a business of selling assets. A once off decision to cease engaging in the activities of AGPS, to dispose of the plant and equipment relevant to those activities, to undertake not to engage in those activities in the future and, in the capacity of client, to invite private enterprise to take on those activities, is not conduct in the carrying on of a business: nor is the conduct of offering plant and equipment for sale and offering the opportunity to perform Package 3 activities for Government departments the carrying on of a business. I conclude, therefore, that s 2A does not have the effect of making the Trade Practices Act applicable to the conduct about which complaint is made by McMillan in these proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of the factual findings which I have made, that is unfortunate. However, it is for the Parliament to determine the extent to which the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade Practices Act</EMPHASIS>  binds the Commonwealth. One might harbour a wish that in the circumstances, the Commonwealth would remedy the effect of the conduct which I have found misleading. However, it is not bound to do so. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7795">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Argument was also addressed to me on the possible application of s 2C of the Trade Practices Act. Section 2C has the effect that certain activity does not, for the purposes of s 2A, amount to carrying on a business. Having regard to the conclusion which I have reached in relation to s 2A, it is not necessary for me to deal with the submissions in relation to s 2C.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of the conclusion which I have reached concerning the effect of s 2A, the application must be dismissed. Because of the possibility that the parties may wish to take the matter further, I have made findings on the substantive factual issues before me. However, the Commonwealth has not been totally successful in relation to those factual issues and I would therefore not be disposed to make an order for costs before hearing the parties on that question. I therefore propose to stand the proceedings over for further argument on the question of costs and for the parties to bring in short minutes.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear John</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing regarding the implications of the Federal Court decision in the case of J S McMillan Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Commonwealth of Australia. As your officers would be aware on Wednesday, 16 July I met with Mr Robert McMillan, Dr John Hewson and Mr Russell Parkes on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My understanding of the situation is that while Justice Emmett dismissed the McMillan case under Section 2A of the Trade Practices Act, he stated that the Commonwealth had misled the tenderer in failing to provide full information in the tender document and in the letter of 5 May to Mr McMillan seeking clarification. In particular, I note Justice Emmett's comments that a tenderer may be excused from assuming that non&hyphen;compliance with the Request for Tender in some respects would not necessarily be fatal to being short&hyphen;listed and his concluding comments that "One might harbour a wish that in the circumstances, the Commonwealth would remedy the effect of the conduct which I have found misleading".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure you appreciate the importance the Government attaches, not the least because of the very large sales in prospect over the next year or so, to ensuring clear and fair processes in relation to asset sales and related transactions. In light of this judicial criticism and subject to constraints associated with any appeal of Justice Emmett's decision, I consider that there would be merit in urgent consideration being given to re-commencing the tendering process for this particular initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I accept that this may result in delay and that your Department has assiduously handled previous disposals of business activities, the criticisms made in the Federal Court decision suggest that a fresh start and an obviously arms-length management of the process would reduce the likelihood of this matter embarrassing, the Government I understand that re-tendering is one of the options that your officers have under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the policy question of the coverage of the Trade Practice Act presume that your Department is consulting with the Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the timeframe involved I would appreciate your advice on progress in regard to this matter.</PARA>
