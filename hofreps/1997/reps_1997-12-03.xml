<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill gives effect to a number of measures announced in the government's 1997&hyphen;98 budget and to a number of non&hyphen;budget measures. One of the measures announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget provided for the reform of the means test treatment of income streams under the Social Security Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms will give greater incentives and provide greater choices for retired people investing in longer term income streams. These amendments complement other government policy initiatives aimed at encouraging the use of superannuation and other investments to provide income in retirement. The reforms will provide a more generous means test of long&hyphen;term pensions and annuities meeting specified criteria. In addition, they will ensure that very wealthy people will no longer be able to use loopholes to access social security payments through the use of short fixed term financial investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be no general savings provision, as this would generally benefit those utilising loopholes. However, people who have products purchased before the commencement of the reforms can request a ministerial exemption from the new regime where significant financial disadvantage may result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has always ensured that the community is widely consulted when 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> measures are being developed. Consistent with this approach, and following on from the extensive consultation with industry and community groups in the policy development process, an exposure draft of the income streams measure was circulated to the financial industry and other interested parties for comment. Responses to the exposure draft have generally been quite favourable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also includes measures that will help carers build on the extra assistance offered in last year's budget, demonstrating the government's determination to offer a better deal to those often unsung Australians looking after friends and relatives. The government recognises the stresses that a caring role can place on carers. In recognition of these stresses, this bill provides for an increase in the number of days a year that a carer can have a break from caring and still remain eligible for the carer payment. While a carer may currently have a break for 52 calendar days per year, this measure will provide that the carer may take a break for 63 days. In addition, qualification for carer payment will be extended to those looking after a profoundly disabled child who is aged under 16.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has always made it clear it believes the vast majority of social security recipients are genuinely in need of assistance. This is why it is determined to protect the integrity of the social security system so that the limited welfare dollar goes only to those who need it most. To this end, reforms in this bill will ensure a better targeting of the welfare dollar by preventing high income seasonal, intermittent or contract workers and their partners from being able to go straight on to a social security benefit during the off&hyphen;season or between contracts. It will also exclude higher paid casual or contract workers and their partners who have their leave entitlements cashed out in their salary payments from receiving social security benefit over short lay&hyphen;offs like Christmas shutdowns. There will be an exemption in cases of severe financial hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also includes measures that aim to make the social security system easier for people to access and understand. Simplifica 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11840"> tion has been a key priority of this government and we are committed to further reducing complexity in the future. In line with such an approach, this bill introduces a fairer and more consistent income and assets test treatment of lump sum amounts for pensions and allowances. This is done by aligning the allowance means test arrangements for lump sums with the pensions means test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, this bill includes a number of amendments that are consequential on various other measures. These include amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 to take account of the change of name of family payment to family allowance. In addition, the bill includes minor amendments to the debt recovery provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 to take account of the introduction in the Farm Household Support Act 1992 of the new `exceptional circumstances relief payment' and the `restart income support'. Lastly, the bill makes a number of minor amendments consequential on the establishment of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are a number of statutory marketing authorities, research and development corporations and other authorities within the primary industries and energy portfolio. This bill will amend relevant acts to remove the legislative requirement for the portfolio minister to approve the terms and conditions of employment, including remuneration, of the principal employee, placing the responsibility for this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> process entirely with the individual organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 will provide a wider scope from which applicants with experience in occupational health and safety can be considered for appointment as a director of the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals&mdash;NRA. It is also proposed to add an additional director of the NRA with experience in the development or administration of Commonwealth government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 specifies that the Australian Horticultural Corporation Selection Committee consists of a chairperson and seven other members. The proposed amendments will reduce the number of `other members' on the corporation from seven to three, four or five. The number of members required for a quorum will be reduced from five to a majority of the members of the selection committee. Other amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 will repeal the corporation's export trading powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 will correct a drafting error by inserting regulation making powers into the sections detailing the meaning of false or misleading description and presentation of wine. Currently, the regulations refer to an inappropriate section of the act and could be subject to challenge. The amendments will permit the regulations to be soundly based in the act, after which the regulations will be amended to refer to the correct head of power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will repeal clauses in the Dairy Produce Act 1986 which exclude people aged 65 and over from holding membership on the board of the Australian Dairy Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a part of the Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia package, the government announced that it would not seek repayment of loans incurred under the farm household support scheme. The decision to terminate the FHS scheme was announced in the 1996-97 budget. The FHS scheme provided income support to farmers to meet day-to-day living expenses who were unable to borrow commercial 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11841"> finance. It was paid as a loan that could be converted to a grant under certain circumstances specified in the FHS Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the life of the FHS scheme&mdash;which commenced in March 1993&mdash;there were approximately 700 FHS recipients. Of these, approximately 115 recipients had all their FHS payments converted to a grant as a result of meeting the legislative requirements. Approximately $5 million in FHS debt is owed to the Commonwealth. Two former FHS recipients have repaid their FHS loans and these people will be reimbursed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The annulment of FHS debts is by legislative amendment, rather than by write-off or waiver, to ensure this change applies in all cases without exception. Because FHS was initially paid as a loan, it was not considered to be income for taxation purposes. When other income support payments are made&mdash;for instance, the drought relief payment&mdash;the Australian Taxation Office applies a rebate so there is zero income tax payable on their income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Acts 1936 and 1997 will ensure that FHS payments, whenever converted to grants, will not be considered as taxable income, and the beneficiary rebate will be applied to the small numbers of people continuing on FHS payments&mdash;no longer as loans&mdash;consistent with the treatment of other income support payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will amend the descriptions of the adjacent areas defined in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 in respect of Western Australia and the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands respectively to make the northern boundaries consistent with the seabed boundaries agreed in the Treaty between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia Establishing an Exclusive Economic Zone Boundary and Certain Seabed Boundaries, which was signed on 14 March 1997. The amendments are necessary to enable ratification of the treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, the government prop 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> oses to reduce Commonwealth funding to the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation in the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year by $3.612 million. Of the money saved, $1.5 million is to go to the adjustment program for the South&hyphen;East Fishery and the balance towards helping to pull back the budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the amendment under the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991 is to formally abolish the Australian Pig Industry Council.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R407">Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997</XREF>  has three main purposes: firstly, to amend the Customs Act 1901 to clarify that the Customs Act does not extend to the Australian external territories; secondly, to amend the Customs Amendment Act (No. 1) 1997 to defer by six months the commencement of the reduced entry threshold for goods imported by the post; and, thirdly, to amend the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 to correct an anomaly in the exercise of Customs' powers of examination of mail arriving into Australia from the external territories.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Amendments to the Customs Act</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present definition of Australia in the Customs Act provides that Australia does not include the territory of Christmas Island or the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11842"> territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The definition of Australia in section 17 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that Australia excludes all external territories except Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The combined effect of these two definitions is that, for the purposes of the Customs Act, Australia does not include any of the external territories. The purpose of the new definition of Australia in section 4 of the Customs Act is to state this position with greater clarity than at present. This definition will provide that Australia does not include the external territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Ashmore and Cartier Islands are a group of islands and reefs 500 nautical miles west of Darwin and 80 nautical miles south of Timor. They are uninhabited islands but are an external territory of Australia administered by the Department of Transport and Regional Development. In recent times there has been an increase in the number of landings by illegal immigrants on Ashmore and Cartier Islands. Previously, there were very limited legislative powers to deal with these landings under customs, immigration and quarantine regimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments were recently made to the Customs Act, the Migration Act 1958 and the Quarantine Act 1908 by the Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Act 1997 to enable certain powers under these regimes to be extended to these islands. The Customs Act presently states that, subject to subsection 6(2), the Customs Act does not extend to the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands. Subsection 6(2) provides that regulations can be made to extend the whole or a part of the Customs Act to these islands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present wording of subsection 6(1), however, does not make it clear that the Customs Act also does not extend to all the other external territories. It is therefore proposed to amend subsection 6(1) to state that the Customs Act does not extend to the external territories. In combination with the new definition of Australia, these two amendments 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will make it clear that the Customs Act does not apply in, or in relation to, the external territories.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Amendments to the Customs Amendment Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Customs Amendment Act (No. 1) 1997 was one of three acts which introduced the cost recovery regime for the provision of certain import related services. Under the regime, an amendment was made to the Customs Act to reduce the value limit of goods imported through the post which require an import entry and which therefore attract an import entry processing charge. This value was reduced from $1,000 to $250, and this amendment is due to commence on 1 April 1998. It is proposed to amend this commencement date to 1 October 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A significant number of representations have been received by government concerning the impact that the decrease in the threshold will have on small to medium business. In response to this, the Australian Customs Service is examining options to simplify the entry procedures for the goods imported by post which will become subject to the entry requirements. The deferral of the commencement date by six months will allow this exercise to continue and be implemented before the threshold is changed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Amendments to the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Customs Act, officers of Customs have the right to examine goods imported into Australia by post. However, a restriction is placed upon Customs' power to examine mail by section 90S of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989&mdash;the Postal Corporation Act. The effect of section 90S is that certain conditions must be satisfied before Customs can examine an article of mail which is in the post between Australia and a place outside Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A difficulty has arisen in the application of this provision to mail from the external territories due to the definition of Australia in the Postal Corporation Act. Under the Postal Corporation Act, `Australia' includes the external territories except Norfolk Island. Under the Customs Act, `Australia' does not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11843"> include the external territories. The effect of this difference in the definition of Australia is that mail that is in the course of the post between any external territory and Australia cannot be examined by Customs. Section 90S does not apply to this mail because the external territories are not a place outside Australia under the Postal Corporation Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is proposed to introduce the new subsection 90S(1A) into the Postal Corporation Act which states that in section 90S Australia does not include the external territories. This will be the same as the definition of Australia in the Customs Act and will enable Customs to examine postal articles from any external territory where the conditions in section 90S have been satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Minor Amendments</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will also make several minor technical amendments to the Customs Act and the Excise Act 1901. These are explained in detail in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been looking forward to speaking on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S124">Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997</XREF>  for some time. It is the most significant piece of legislation that this parliament has seen since the federal election in 1996. With a background of small business&mdash;my father, mother and I have been in small business&mdash;I have had the pleasure of being categorised as a small business person. I hope that my sons, who are also involved in business, will continue to pursue that activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, one of my sons is in America conducting his own small business, which is rapidly growing into a middle size business and will one day be a large business. So it is with some pride that I pay tribute to the people who are involved in small business. They are special people in Australia. They have lots of guts and determination and have helped build this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind members that there are 786,000 small businesses in Australia, according to the last official survey. In fact, 97 per cent of all businesses in Australia are small businesses. Small businesses employ nearly 50 per cent of the total non-agricultural private sector work force. They are at the forefront in employment, creating 65 per cent of new jobs in 1995-96, and are making a very solid contribution to the growth of manufacturing and services exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently I had the pleasure of being briefed on Austrade. It was pleasing to note that most of their new activity&mdash;if I remember correctly, 70 per cent of their new activity&mdash;is for small and medium size business enterprises seeking export trade for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation reflects the recommendations of our good colleague and friend, the committee chair, the member for Bendigo, Bruce Reid. He led the all-party House of Representatives Standing Committee on Indu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11844"> stry, Science and Technology, which brought in very significant recommendations to give a new deal to small business. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, is to be commended for acting so promptly and announcing the government's response, which by and large reflects the spirit and recommendations of the Reid committee, but with some necessary adaptions which I think complement the recommendations. It is well known that the government's announcement, which is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New deal: fair deal&mdash;giving small business a fair go</EMPHASIS>, has been widely acclaimed across the whole spectrum of Australia's business activity, particularly small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the progress being made in this legislation by this reformist government in tackling issues that small business has wanted tackled for many years, it is very frustrating for small business in Australia to see obstacles being put in the path of a reformist government like ours. I want to refer to the Wik debate, which I think has some relevance. I have just said that small business is making a major contribution to Australia's growth, particularly to employment growth. Yet we are seeing unfolding in the Senate a series of moves by Independents, the ALP, the Greens and the Democrats that will, undoubtedly, no matter how you view the debate, have a prejudicial and negative effect on business investment, business confidence and decision making in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer briefly to a comment by Robert Gottliebsen, the Editor of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS>. In his column of 1 December 1997 headed `Nub of the Wik debate' he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all the debate over Wik, the nub of the problem is rarely stated. If Aboriginal communities have effective right of veto over the creation of major areas of wealth in Australia, almost certainly much less wealth will be created. Already, miners have switched some of their exploration activity overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If less wealth is created, there will be less money available for social services, pensions and the other benefits that Australians expect from their Government. To those not directly involved, it would appear that there should be plenty of scope to satisfy the aspirations of Aborigines who want contact with the land without giving them power of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> veto over wealth creation. Unfortunately, a lot of other games are being played.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whichever side of politics you are on, you have to take notice of comments like that. Those comments are being offered by people who observe Australia and who have an intimate knowledge of what makes commercial activity, what generates confidence and what does not and what attracts investment and what does not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the whole of this nation that sort of attitude, that sort of reflection is coming through. How on earth can the opposition ask small business to continue to carry the brunt and the responsibility of expanding this economy, of tackling the investment opportunities that we know we all have and, above all, of creating new jobs, especially for our young people? How on earth can you expect small business people to do that when they are constantly being confronted by the ALP, the Greens, the Democrats and others putting forward notions and views on certain important issues, such as the Wik debate, that have a direct deleterious effect on investment and confidence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is time that the Australian people took to task those members of parliament who do not take the responsibility and trouble to fully appreciate and understand the implications of the 10-point plan of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and who use populist, emotional arguments and ignore the core. This legislation, to which I have the privilege of contributing something today, provides an opportunity to remind members of parliament just what it is all about. You have to take responsibility for your words and actions when you are a member of parliament, particularly at a time when Australia is coming out of the worst recession it has had for years&mdash;caused by the previous 13 years of Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to briefly mention some wonderful things that have been happening under the coalition government that have contributed&mdash;as well as this legislation&mdash;to increased potential investment for small business in Australia. We all know that, when the new government was elected, it inherited a deficit of some $10 billion and record government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11845"> debt which had risen at frightening levels. All of those activities under 13 years of Labor had generated increased interest rates and higher inflation and had destroyed almost totally business confidence and willingness to make new investment and create new jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We remember, unfortunately, the very high interest rates paid on overdrafts by small businesses. I felt that pain in my own small business when I struggled to pay wages and keep up with double digit interest rates. It brought many businesses undone. I would like to place on record the comments of the Australian Bankers Association made on 27 November 1997, welcoming the recent Reserve Bank figures which confirm reduced margins on small business loans. Most small businesses operate on borrowed capital as well as their own hard won capital and equity. Without lowered interest rates for small business, you do not get the atmospherics that will attract new investment, confidence and&mdash;again, I emphasise&mdash;new jobs, especially for our young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Bankers Association pointed out that figures released in the November issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reserve Bank Bulletin</EMPHASIS> show that small business is now receiving the benefits of intense competition between banks. That has been contributed to by this coalition government, this reformist government. The Australian Bankers Association said that the Reserve Bank has now clearly confirmed that there is a trend in the marketplace which is yielding better deals for small  business. There has been a drop of 3.1 percentage points in the average interest received by banks for variable rate small business loans since mid-1996. During that time the cash rate has come down only 2.5 percentage points. The indicator rate on new fixed rate loans has also come down 2.9 per cent, and the figure for residential secured overdrafts has dropped an impressive 4.7 per cent, which is almost double the fall in the cash rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Bankers Association went on to say that in practical terms the small business with a loan of $100,000 would have benefited from a drop in annual interest rates of $3,100. This would have been partly because of the general drop in interest rates, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but $600 would have been from the banks' reduction in margins. That is due to the extra competition generated as a result of the coalition government's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Bankers Association said a small business with a residentially secured loan would have done even better, and many small businesses are now using the equity in their homes to assist them to negotiate better rates with banks for their working capital overdrafts. In the case of a small business taking out a residentially secured loan, there would be an average reduction in interest of $4,700 per annum, of which $2,200 would have been the result of reduced bank margins&mdash;in my words, I add&mdash;directly as a result of the coalition government's spirited policies to stimulate additional competition in the money market/banking area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to increase activities and opportunities for credit unions and building societies provides another welcome entrant into the marketplace and also provides, it follows, additional access avenues for small business to get loan money that they can inject into their business and so service their old debts&mdash;replace them in many cases&mdash;and regear so they can get on with the challenges of expanding their business. I would like to record, therefore, that it is time for the opposition, particularly, to take a close look at itself and its performance and to reflect on the damage it is doing by obstructing the reforms of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I just mention briefly another example of obstructionism by the opposition having a deleterious effect on small business. I bring members back to my opening remarks that small business is the heart and soul of Australia's commercial activity. More than 50 per cent of jobs come from small business. Most growth, investment and expansion is coming from small business. So everything that the opposition does to obstruct reforms by this government to help small business strikes a direct blow at that dynamic, which cannot be tolerated any longer and needs to be exposed very graphically to the Australian people over the next few months leading to the election, whenever it is.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11846">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about another example of the opposition's obstruction? Let us have a look at the efforts of the government to further reform the unfair dismissal laws of Australia. The recent efforts by the government to give exemptions from the unfair dismissal laws for those small businesses employing 50 people or less have been stopped dead in their tracks by the opposition in the Senate. What an extraordinary thing for them to do. They have stopped that legislation, which would have undoubtedly given further confidence and stimulated small business to offer more jobs, particularly for young people going into the 1998 post&hyphen;school 1997 employment growth scenario.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind members of the opposition, if they have forgotten, that young people in Australia are now leaving school having completed their studies or are graduating from universities and TAFEs and are looking for work in 1998. This is the time for all members of parliament to remind the opposition that they have to take account of what they are doing to stop young people in Australia from getting employment opportunities. One of those very great obstructions is the acknowledged message coming from small business: `We are scared out of our mind to take on new people for a number of factors. One of them is the problem of unfair dismissal for new employees, particularly in the first year of employment.' So the government responded to that by saying it would offer legislation to give an exemption from the unfair dismissal law for a small business employing up to 15.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would have thought that the opposition, recognising the number of young people unemployed in Australia due to their 13 years of neglect, would have given every comfort to the government to get that legislation through so we could be job ready and business ready in 1998 to increase young Australians' chances of getting a job. But, no, the opposition have obstructed and stopped that bill dead in the Senate. I say: bring them to account because it is time that the Australian people were given an opportunity to mark the dismal performance and deliberate, obstructive activities of the opposition, particularly in the area of small business.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I return to the legislation and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New deal: fair deal&mdash;giving small business a fair go</EMPHASIS> and remind members of some of the components of the legislation. It introduces a new small business section in the Trade Practices Act prohibiting unconscionable conduct&mdash;a welcome initiative giving small business the same access in a way to trade practices law that consumers have had. Strangely, as Peter Reith pointed out, the trade practices law in Australia has been developed largely to give consumer protection. Now this new, reformist government is offering trade practices protection for small business as well as the consumer. This provision does that. It is a very exciting development in the business of trade law in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also the legislation and the initiative of the government provides new protection for small business franchisees through a mandatory and stronger franchising code of conduct. Coalition members in regional areas of Australia have been working very hard to tackle the hydra&hyphen;headed monster of petroleum industry reform that previous governments have not tackled, notwithstanding the reports of 30 inquiries gathering dust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional members of the coalition have already taken a number of steps, such as opening up terminals&mdash;so that there is no longer that obstruction&mdash;and increasing transparency. Prices are now being monitored by the ACCC and the motoring organisations, so accountability and opportunity for whistleblowing is opening up and the consumer has the chance to judge and to comment more freely and to put pressure on those in the industry to make them more consumer friendly. We also have new independents coming in and new dynamics in the retail industry as a result of our policies. New players such as Safeway and other smaller people in the retail industry are providing fuel as an adjunct to their business at a lower price, thus driving down the prices of the other people in the industries. There is a lot more to come in the area of fuel reform&mdash;watch this space.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also introducing a minimum legislative standard to protect retail tenants, and it is good to see that most of the states are now responding favourably, in their way, to this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11847"> initiative of the federal government. We are giving stronger enforcement rights to the ACCC in respect of small business fair trading rights, including the ability to take representative legal action on behalf of small business. We are supporting alternative dispute resolution to provide small business with quicker, less costly and more efficient remedies&mdash;a very welcome move. We are supporting the extension of the Banking Industry Ombudsman, enabling the ombudsman to deal with issues raised by small business and not just consumers&mdash;a very important initiative.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a former small business woman, I am particularly pleased and proud to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R311">Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill</XREF> , which was introduced into the House on 30 September this year. This legislation marks a new vision and attitude for Australian small business. The role of small business in this country has been vital, accounting for the majority of all businesses in Australia. In addition, small businesses in all areas&mdash;whether they be small regional townships like Healesville or larger urban communities such as Diamond Creek or Craigieburn in my electorate of McEwen&mdash;will get from this legislation fair and adequate representation in business transactions, better representation in conflict resolution, education, and self&hyphen;regulating codes of practice underpinned by legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is long overdue because, unfortunately, the previous government not only ignored the impact of the small business sector on our economy but also through deliberate policy decisions threatened the viability of small business and caused loss of employment. It has taken the initiative of this government to introduce measures to redress the problems and to recognise small business as a vital part of our nation. We will achieve that by strengthening the Trade Practices Act to not only protect the interests and viability of small business but also allow business in all its forms to work within a framework to settle disputes fairly and on an equal footing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 13 years the opposition never made any progress in reforming the environment in which small business operates. They lacked any commitment to small business and refused to listen to the needs of the small business community. The opposition held a total of 17 inquiries during their 13 years in office but produced no action to assist small business. Their 13 years represents a complete failure to the Australian small business sector. It is only with the initiatives contained in this legislation that the majority of small businesses around Australia have been able to breathe a sigh of relief that at long last they have a government which has been prepared to listen to their concerns and act on their behalf to ensure that they are treated as equal partners with big business in business transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation arises out of the government's response to the fair trading inquiry, of which I was a member. Submissions from over 200 business groups and organisations were received and over 50 organisations gave evidence directly to the committee in public hearings. These investigations identified several areas of concern that needed urgent action: the lack of transparency of information where prospective small business owners did not receive the required information on a venture before entering into an agreement; the problems of complex or unfamiliar documentation; the inflexibility of terms and conditions within an agreement; harsh or harmful behaviour within business relationships; and an ineffective access to justice. In fact, the government has acted on seven major areas of concern: unfair conduct, retail tenancy, franchising, misuse of market power, small business finance and access to justice and education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the first time that a government has provided small businesses with legislation that addresses fair trading issues and problems in business transactions. This will provide new levels of protection for small business through either a voluntary or a mandatory code of conduct underpinned by the Trade Practices Agreement. These voluntary and mandatory codes are good news for all small businesses as each industry will be able to focus regulations to suit the specific conditions of each 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11848"> industry and provide the sector with a prescribed set of regulations to potentially suit all members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would argue that self&hyphen;regulation, where plausible, does address the needs of businesses but that in areas such as franchising the mandatory prescribed codes put forward in this bill are necessary and will ensure that safeguards that have been so obviously lacking in the past are binding on all participants in that sector. Such specific industry codes of practice will give an opportunity for industry involvement and secure appropriately targeted dispute resolution. Where possible the government will allow sectors that are able to manage and regulate their own industry to do so within the legislative boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has provided that a franchising code of practice will be supported as a mandatory code with full legislative underpinning. I wholeheartedly support this action by the government. In addition, a new industry body, to be known as the Franchising Industry Council, will be set up to monitor and review the franchising code of practice and will provide government with advice and specific industry based information. This new council will include industry members and will have an independent chair to ensure its balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fair trading report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS> has identified many examples of small business failures and of financial ruin and breakdown of marriages and families caused because business decisions were often made under pressure and without full or accurate information. The government accepts that this environment is not conducive to operating small businesses successfully and that, because of the unequal power that exists in the marketplace, small business is particularly at risk and frequently disadvantaged, and at times has suffered financial ruin because of this inequality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to ensuring that small business owners are able to confront problems without the inherent tension and inequality that has been present in past years. This legislation will redress this iniquitous situation and reduce the incidence of physical stress and breakdown of relationships experienced by small business owners and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> managers&mdash;conditions against which the opposition refused to act and could only offer a string of inquiries without any prospect for change or improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Franchising is an essential part of Australia's business and financial community. With an annual growth rate of 14 per cent in 1993, with a total turnover for 1993&hyphen;94 of $42.7 billion and with twice as many franchising systems per head in Australia as in the United States, it is essential that we give these businesses the chance that they deserve, ensuring that all businesses are treated equitably and fairly in all business transactions so that they will thrive and create more jobs. Franchises are able to provide small business men and women with a strong base in training and support, a recognised product and the benefits of playing a part in a team of similar businesses. But franchisees must be allowed to operate in a fair environment and be fully informed in order to succeed. During the committee's investigations, many concerns were raised by franchisees, and it is solely due to the effort of this government that we are now able to provide the opportunity for a balanced relationship between franchisers and franchisees through the provisions of this bill, which will provide support and a means to dispute resolution without substantial expense and within an environment that encourages competition and growth in franchises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly there has been a history of unfair dealings within the small business community, as identified within the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS>, where there have been numerous examples of lack of information, misinformation given to prospective small business owners or inadequate disclosure of relevant and important commercial information prior to contractual agreement causing business failure. Some examples are: an inflated account of business profits or value; an inability to negotiate terms of contracts; an inability of the prospective owner to match the size and strength of the other party during negotiations as well as a lack of understanding of complex documentation; where a business relationship may be characterised with a difficulty in communication; and where, through a lack of knowledge or lack of trans 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11849"> parency, a small business owner may not know or understand the processes to access justice or dispute resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Included in this bill is a section focused on unconscionable conduct and its effects on small business. One of the most important sections of this proposed new section of the Trade Practices Act dealing specifically with small business relations is that it is just that&mdash;an entire section, 51AC, devoted entirely to the needs of the small business owner or manager. This is a first for small business, because this is the first time a government has had the will or commitment to stand up for small business and be prepared to legislate on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, unconscionable conduct has been difficult to prove in practice, as precedents have accepted that commercial transactions are often unequal and that this is the simple nature of business conduct. In addition, to prove an action as unconscionable under a breach of the current trade practices law, conventionally the aggrieved party must establish that it was in the position of a special disability through suffering ignorance in material facts known to the other party: for example, illiteracy, age, physical disabilities or emotional dependence. In order to establish proof of unconscionable conduct in the past, the aggrieved, and usually less powerful, parties had to prove that they were in a position of disadvantage which the other party knew about and took unfair advantage of the situation to the disadvantage of that party. This has proved to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for small businesses, who have usually neither the financial means nor the ability to take time out of running their businesses to face long court battles trying to prove that their grievances fall within the prescribed guidelines. Legal representation, either in informal discussions or in the courts, has placed a huge burden on small business, a position from which many of them have not recovered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the new proposals in this bill designed to determine whether unconscionable conduct has been used in a commercial transaction. Both listed public companies and transactions exceeding $1 million are exclud 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed from the remedies proposed under section 5lAC regarding unconscionable conduct in commercial transactions. These provisions will ensure that these conditions are limited to disputes involving small businesses. Alternative dispute resolution services in the business arena through mediation and conflict resolution offer the possibility of providing a service which is more flexible in its outcomes, providing the means for negotiation and a better prospect for both parties to settle disputes. Outcomes can be kept private so that the confidential dealings of a business are not broadcast to the greater community. This has the advantage over court proceedings, where disputes are often drawn out, causing further emotional and financial strain to small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill establishes the position of dispute resolution adviser to assist in individual inquiries and concerns. This arrangement aims to provide an essential service. The adviser will act as an additional information point and advise inexperienced franchisees about what options are available. The adviser will be able to assist in the selection of a suitable mediator and reduce the likelihood of lengthy legal battles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's belated call for the inclusion of `unfair conduct' within the legislation is not appropriate, I believe. While the Reid committee&mdash;and I add, as I have previously, that I was a member of that committee&mdash;made recommendations referring to `unfair conduct', it should be noted that not one of us on that committee had any legal qualifications. After detailed analysis of this, the government's response is better, and it is workable, and it has captured the intent of the committee's recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The move by the opposition to include `unfair conduct' within the legislation would open a Pandora's box for both lawyers and the courts throughout Australia. This `unfair conduct' terminology has had no opportunity to be subject to the interpretation of the courts. If included within this legislation, it could have disastrous effects for small business. As a member of the committee, I accept the government's decision, which has received 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11850"> widespread support from small business people and from economic and legal analysts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Greek mythology, Pandora, in opening the forbidden box, let loose all the ravages of the modern world and, in so doing, changed life for all time. In attempting to retrieve the situation, Pandora, unfortunately, denied forever the promise of hope. Just as Pandora acted without respect or concern for others, so too does the opposition in calling for the words `unfair conduct' to replace `unconscionable conduct' in the bill. The opposition is trying to open a veritable Pandora's box of legislative and judicial problems. In doing so, it denies small businesses any hope of a speedy and fair resolution to disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to supporting the small business sector. Through this bill, it will extend the voluntary codes of practice and alternative dispute resolution services to include incorporated small businesses. In addition to the measures for alternative conflict resolution services mentioned previously, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is to play a greater role in the representation of small business in actions against unfair business conduct, with an increase in their resources to allow for a more active role where complaints are able to be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such an increase is to include the immediate appointment of a small business commissioner to directly represent the interests of small business. Correspondingly, the government will ensure that the Competition and Consumer Commission in each state and territory throughout Australia has access to a small business case officer who will be able to assist with specific problems through a close association with both the ACCC and the state&hyphen; or territory&hyphen;wide business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the previous government, the small business sector was unable to access either the Banking Industry Ombudsman or the code of banking practice. This bill changes that by insisting that these schemes should apply to all small businesses indiscriminately. In the past small business, if incorporated, could never gain access to these services. It is to the government's credit that this is yet another 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Reid report recommendation which the government has recognised and acted upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms contained within the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill include a section devoted entirely to the availability of information and education for small business. In my electorate office I have received an overwhelming number of requests for information on small business issues. It is this thirst for information that frequently determines the future success of a small business. This bill recognises and addresses this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the main problems small business owners have faced over the past years has been lack of information in relation to the hazards and financial merit of either franchising or retail tenancies. Such information is vital to prospective franchisees and tenants. The Reid report acknowledged that a great percentage&mdash;75 per cent&mdash;of small business owners have little or no experience beyond school based education. It is, therefore, understandable that only a small percentage have experience in training, budget planning or marketing, although they may have an outstanding product or service as the basis of their small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While sections of the bill are specifically targeted at the management practices and relationships between businesses, the area specifying the education of small business owners in relation to changes to practice management, avenues available for specific forms of assistance and how to access these areas is very important and long overdue. Information will be readily accessible through training providers, specific industry based associations and on electronic services such as the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, this bill seeks to restore the balance between small business and big business, illustrating the nature in which this government is prepared to stand up for the small business person. I join the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in believing that this bill seeks to encourage Australian businesses to deal with each other fairly and reasonably. I support the aims of the legislation to redress the imbalance of power between small business and big 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11851"> business. I applaud this government for taking on board the recommendations of the Reid report. I strongly support this bill for the benefits it promises to deliver for small businesses in McEwen and around Australia. This legislation proposes a new deal for business men and women. Most importantly, it provides them with a fair deal. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak today on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S124">Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997</XREF> , I would like to say from the outset that the measures brought down in this bill are equitable, effective, fair and indeed long overdue. These measures aim to provide relief to small business&mdash;the relief that small business owners did not experience under Labor. These measures are not rhetoric, as the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) would have had us believe when he spoke on this bill. Rather, they deliver landmark reforms to sections of the retail industry which had been screaming out in vain for a fair deal under the Keating administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I do concur with the member for Cunningham on one particular point. He referred to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a Balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS>, and said the report was `one of the better parliamentary committee reports that has been generated for quite some time'. I thank him for those kind words. As a member of the committee, I, along with the chair of the committee, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), and my other colleagues, can take particular pride in the kind words of the member for Cunningham when he acknowledged:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">referring to the member for Bendigo&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and his committee members showed compassion and interest. They actually showed that they were prepared to bring down some recommendations in this parliament to delve into those great concerns that the small business community in this country had for their future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, in recognising this report for the quality product it is, and the members for their concerted effort, the member for Cun 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ningham has become a dangerously loose cannon for the ALP. He had the gall to stand on the other side of this House and quote from the draft platform speech of the Australian Labor Party, given by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), and try to draw an extremely long bow in relating this worthless piece of populist policy making to some sort of commitment the Labor Party has to small business. Let me again quote the member for Cunningham:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key part of Labor's agenda for industry must also be to harness the energy, drive and flexibility of small business to provide opportunities for as many Australians as possible.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on further with his hollow promises when he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe in strategic intervention for small business to guarantee a fair and competitive economic environment, and address the obstacles the small business community faces including their market power disadvantage, compliance costs and access to finance and justice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And he accuses us of espousing rhetoric! This is the same party that, despite 17 reports on fair trading in their 13 years of government, failed to provide any real protection for those small businesses for which they profess to guarantee a fair and equitable economic environment. This just proves that the Labor Party's draft platform reeks of a tired, old Labor Party. Indeed, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) admitted in an interview on Radio National only the other week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sure, there are all sorts of elements of continuity, between the kind of government that we were for the last thirteen years and the kind of government that we will be in the future. We'd be utterly implausible if we tried to present ourselves as a different kind of outfit.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am sure that the majority of small business owners would find little comfort in that remark. But they can draw comfort from the knowledge that this government has broken Labor's cycle of inaction and has delivered a fair trading package that is a big win for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974&mdash;in respect of section 51AD, relating to the introduction of mandatory and voluntary industry codes, and section 51AC, relating to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11852"> the prevention of unconscionable conduct by corporations against individuals&mdash;provide meaningful protection for those small businesses that have been struggling under Labor's unworkable regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the coalition, since coming into office, have actively demonstrated our determination to make things easier for small business, which we consider rightly to be the engine room of our economy. This commitment has been delivered in the form of the coalition's small business policy statement, released in response to the committee's report, entitled A New Deal for Small Business, and the government's response to the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS>. The response to the committee's report is considered to be the most extensive program of reforms on business conduct undertaken by any government in more than two decades. In light of my previous comments in relation to the poor performance of the Labor Party in responding to the pleas of small businesses, this is not at all surprising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was encouraging to read an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  recently reporting on the promising signs of an emerging economic recovery. The article noted improvements in general business conditions and expectations, lending even further weight to the onset of an extended expansionary phase. This is welcome news for all Australians. Moreover, a recent Yellow Pages survey indicated that there is growing confidence in the small business sector, a confidence level that is the highest for 2&half; years. Thirty&hyphen;four per cent of those surveyed expect the economy to be better a year from now, and there can be no doubt that legislation such as we are debating today will go some way to achieving this goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my frequent visits to businesses in my electorate of Canning, both recently and throughout my many years of campaigning, I have been continually struck by the fact that small business has been adversely affected in a number of areas, particularly in matters concerning franchising, retail tenancy and justice. As a member of the committee, I heard many stories of anger, frustration&mdash;at times&mdash;and complete despondency with the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ridiculous circumstances some small businesses were expected to accommodate. The report into fair trading was imperative, just as action to ensure that acceptable and fair business conduct is practised in Australia is now critically important for the success of our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business holds the key to the revival of our economy. Small business needs to be given the opportunity not only to survive but also to prosper. But it needs to be able to do so free from the predatory practices and standover tactics that proprietors have been experiencing for such a long time. Predatory practices of big business are just not acceptable. Unconscionable practices serve only to stifle entrepreneurial activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to monitor this, each state and territory will, under our legislation, have two small business associate commissioners and a small business case officer. Combined with education campaigns, these two aspects will serve as very useful tools in dispute resolution&mdash;something which sadly has been missing for quite some time. Clearly, therefore, the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997  will assist in providing existing as well as budding small business owners with the confidence and the certainty that they need to expand their businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the recent half&hyphen;hour of rhetoric from the member for Cunningham, he stated that Labor is leading from the front with respect to introducing a uniform retail tenancy code. That certainly would be something new. Let's be real: since when has the Labor Party been leading the way in introducing any measures to help small business? Small plans, small intentions, small deeds and a small record: small is all that those opposite have in common with small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor were too scared to take decisive action when they were in government, but now we witness them attempting to masquerade as everybody's best friend whilst in the wilderness of opposition. An effective opposition is vital to a democratic system of government, and I think that it is high time that the Labor Party began fulfilling their role with some degree of integrity and sincerity, if that is at all possible.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11853">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the amendment bill before us, we have a useful, practical and ultimately desirable amendment bill that I think will go a long way to making a fairer deal for small businesses. Certainly there may be other measures that can be given further consideration to complement those being discussed today. However, on the whole, this bill faithfully reflects the primary sentiments of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The term `unconscionable conduct' has been given preference over introducing a broader prohibition on unfair conduct. This aspect of the legislation has been contentiously debated by those opposite. This government considers it appropriate to weigh up factors of equity and justice in the preparation of public policy making. In the case of fair trading, the notion of unfair conduct&mdash;given the fact that it is not recognised by current common law&mdash;carries with it the probability of further uncertainty and disruption. The purpose of this legislation is to enable small businesses to enter into fair and equitable arrangements. Whilst creating a more conducive environment in which small business can thrive, it does not seek, however, to sustain those who should not be in business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish on the same note on which I began, by reasserting the  Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997  as being decidedly based upon factors of equity, effectiveness and fairness. To say that these measures are long overdue would again be stating the obvious as well as being a gross understatement. This amendment bill is a tangible indication of the coalition's representation of small business. Helping small business, a vital generator of economic wealth&mdash;creating 65 per cent of new jobs in the 1995&hyphen;96 year&mdash;was what we on this side campaigned on in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election, the election which saw an overwhelmingly majority of the Australian people vote in favour of the coalition government. This bill is proof of this government's following through on their promises which, as has been indicated, is a great deal more than those opposite have been able to achieve with their hollow promises.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak in the House today on the issue of fair trading and in particular the needs of franchisees to have some form of protection against unscrupulous franchisor companies. I have met several franchisees who have lost everything&mdash;their capital, their stores, their capacity to earn and even their dignity as individuals, sometimes being tossed out of their homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased to be part of the government which introduced the Reid report on small business, the fair trading report as it has become known. I know the problems with franchising have been universal and not restricted to my electorate. My constituents have phoned me to thank me for the work I did for them, but more particularly to congratulate the government on the small business package, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New deal: fair deal</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not the only ones. The business sector has almost universally commended the package not just in respect of franchises but also in respect of other matters of the package which I will deal with later in my address. The Australian Business Chamber has said that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New deal: fair deal</EMPHASIS> package would address the difference between small business and big business. The Australian Small Business Association said that the government had recognised the principle of unconscionability and lack of bargaining parity between small and big businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Franchise Council of Australia has welcomed the code, saying that minimum standards of disclosure are necessary in franchise operations, and stock dumping and churning have no part in ethical franchising. This is something I have encountered in my examination of various franchises in my electorate. The Australian Retailers Association said that it wholeheartedly supports the overseeing by government of proposals to review retail tenancy legislation, saying that it provides small business with the ability to take action against shopping centre landlords for unconscionable conduct. There have been a whole range of peak bodies that have come out and commended this legislation. All small business peak industry groups have been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11854"> supportive of the legislation and they want to see it implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Reid committee was commissioned to look at six areas of concern to small business: retail tenancy, franchising, the misuse of market power, unfair conduct, finance, and access to justice and education. It dealt with five key points: to strengthen the Trade Practices Act to improve the legislative protection for small business against the unconscionable conduct of big business and landlords, and to provide the same protections to them as to consumers; to provide legal recognition for codes of conduct under the Trade Practices Act and an avenue for legal redress; to tighten up on franchising rorts&mdash;in particular churning, rent loading and stock dumping&mdash;and allow franchisees to pursue legal action under the Trade Practices Act without needing to prove misleading and deceptive conduct, and introducing unconscionable conduct as part of the regime for seeking redress; to improve the lot of small business when dealing with property owners by facilitating national negotiations between peak representatives of both retailers and property owners; and to extend to small business the powers of the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman and the new banking code of practice to ensure that small businesses have the right of redress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I do find in the electorate in relation to small business as I move around is that we often have circumstances in which small businesses have been treated in very cavalier fashion, even in unconscionable fashion, by some of the banks, generally at a time when those small businesses are hard&hyphen;pressed to expand the businesses or hard&hyphen;pressed for capital. At those times they are not in a position to take on the big banks. So it is a very important time in the life of a small business when capital dries up and the banks are either pressing for higher rates of interest for default or making unreasonable demands on the business and there is nowhere to go; there is no money to fight legal action. I find that a particularly important aspect of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it would be fair to say that the coalition believes small business is vital to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian economy. We have had national unemployment of around 8.6 per cent. In my electorate of Hinkler the rate has varied between 14 and 15 per cent. These high unemployment rates were caused partially by the recession and partially by a lack of infrastructure. But I think one of the other factors has been the closure and contraction of many small businesses during the recessionary period. I think that has, in a way, contributed to the unemployment malaise in my area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But why haven't the small businesses managed to be restored? Why can't small business get a fair go in the market? What is wrong with the economic and legislative climate that small business has to operate in? The Australian economy is vastly different today from a decade ago and is becoming increasingly more open and competitive. Ten years ago it was only big businesses, law firms, scientists and academics who were right into the newer avenues of electronic data collection and things such as the Internet. Today almost everybody has access to the Internet. They can use it for all sorts of things. They can use it to enhance their business or even for shopping. So the strains on small business are increasing all the time and small businesses do not have the benefit of the economies of scale or the backup that exists in medium and large business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the one thing that has not helped them is that legislation has remained substantially the same. There is not enough protection for small businesses. The Trade Practices Act currently does not have mechanisms to provide protection for small business from unconscionable conduct. Clearly the mechanisms set up in the past&mdash;such as the franchising code of practice, which was voluntary&mdash;were not sufficient. When some unscrupulous franchising companies flouted the law, it was unlikely that they would adhere to the voluntary code of practice. A provision under the Trade Practices Act, section 51AC, will build on well understood consumer protections previously not afforded to small business to protect business from this unconscionable conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition believes business should be left to do business. The regulatory environ 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11855"> ment should not be such that businesses are constricted in the way that they do business. The new provisions to protect small business from unconscionable conduct builds on well established legal doctrines. There is already a body of case law on the protection available to consumers under unconscionable conduct. The small business provision of the Trade Practices Act is designed to induce behavioural change in dealings between large and small business and to ensure that commercial dealings are carried out equitably. It recognises the relationship between small business and big business, and works to address the differences. The unfair advantage that big business has over small business&mdash;not due to legislation but due to the simple rules of economies of scale&mdash;needs also to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment provides for a court to consider the relative bargaining power of the business; whether the business had to comply with unreasonable conditions; whether the business understood the nature of the supply agreement; whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on the business operator; the price of goods and what their equals were in the market; any requirements that might be applicable to an industry code; the extent to which the supplier failed to disclose the nature of the business and the supply relationship; any risks associated through the business; and the extent to which the supplier was willing to negotiate the terms and conditions of any contract for supply and the extent to which the supplier and business acted in good faith. These are all matters of great concern to small business. In fact, these matters are at the heart of the terms of reference of the Reid inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision of protection to small business which is already available to consumers needs to be extended and enhanced. The new provisions will ensure that the Trade Practices Act covers areas where there has been a history of exploited or unconscionable conduct. It provides some mechanisms for protection in retail tenancy agreements, financing and security transactions, and franchising transactions. It is distinct and separate from the provisions for consumers because the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> needs of small business are quite different from those of consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process we are witnessing here today stands in stark contrast to 13 years of Labor in action. It is hard to comprehend that over 13 years Labor considered 17 different reports. One report, introduced by the then minister, the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), and commented on in the House, took 12 months to receive an official response. After the previous government had gone through this tortured process it rejected all the recommendations of that report bar about 15 per cent. The member for Rankin expressed his frustration in a radio interview on one occasion, calling himself `Mr 15 Per Cent'. It is a terrible indictment of the previous government to have had 17 reports in 13 years and to have acted on virtually none of them. To take a full year to respond to one of them in the parliament and then to implement only 15 per cent of it shows that the government had no will to help small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in November 1995, with speculation rife that an election was in the air, in the second last week of the sittings the previous government introduced a bill. It was inadequate, it was a masterpiece of window-dressing and it was the ultimate in cynicism because the government had not the least intention of implementing it before the parliament rose. It was just something to pin some sort of small business credentials to as the government went towards the election. Far from evoking a warm response from small business, it was treated with the contempt it deserved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to compliment the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) for his action, which stands in contrast to the dithering that went on during the 13 years of Labor and, in particular, compliment the whole Reid report process. It is certainly one of the most impressive timetables that I have seen enacted in my time in the parliament. The Reid report was tabled on 27 May. Minister Reith took up the portfolio of small business in the reshuffle of 11 July. He responded in full detail with the government's intentions in respect of the Reid report&mdash;and quite comprehensive they were too&mdash;at 4 p.m. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11856"> on 30 September. Now here we are in early December of the same year debating the final stages, in the House of Representatives at least, of that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One business commentator, whom I loosely paraphrase, said: `It was like a 400 metre race with the government 200 metres down the track before the big players got out of the starting blocks.' When the minister made his response I was amazed at the response of the shadow minister, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). I think he was taken by surprise. I do not think he expected that so many of the things small business had been asking for would be dealt with. I found the second reading amendment he signalled to the House on that occasion absolutely extraordinary. It recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the bill be amended to incorporate the recommendations of the Committee . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For heaven's sake, the recommendations of the committee were agreed to by all the Labor members with the exception of one small dissent by the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). In other words, it was almost unanimous. There was almost complete agreement to the Reid report. So to move an amendment that recommends `the bill be amended to incorporate the recommendations of the committee' is nonsense. It also says that the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . considers the Government's response is inadequate and its rhetoric does not match either its election commitments or the Committee's findings . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, that is nonsense. Fancy having the gall to say that, after 17 reports of your own over 13 years. In other parts of the speech of the member for Cunningham he is quite generous with the findings of the report. His amendments are totally out of kilter with the report itself and quite out of kilter with the response of his own Labor members who were part of the Reid committee. And, what is even worse, his amendments do not go any way to addressing the real problems which Minister Reith himself has addressed in his response and has brought into legislation. The member for Cunningham also quoted from an address by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), in which he said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key part of Labor's agenda for industry must be to harness the energy, drive and flexibility of small business to provide opportunities for as many Australians as possible.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, what an extraordinary thing to say after having ducked the issue for 13 years and disregarded 17 reports. The address goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor recognises the enormous job creating potential of Australian small business. We believe in strategic intervention for small business to guarantee a fair and competitive economic environment and address the obstacles the small business community faces, including their market power advantage, compliance costs and access to finance and justice.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not one of those things was addressed over 13 years. I suspect too that, in moving those amendments, the member for Cunningham might be using a bit of the technique he used with the unfair dismissal legislation to manufacture a clash between the government and the Senate and, by so doing, blunt or slow down this new legislation on fair trading. I suspect that there might be more to what he said than a considered response to the government's initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few minutes that are left, I would like to talk about franchising. This is a prime concern of mine. I have had a lot of constituents come to me with problems in franchising. They all follow a pattern: a glorious picture is painted by the franchisor; every encouragement is made for the franchisee to sign up; all sorts of promises are given about assisting them with the running of the operation&mdash;these are generally not fulfilled&mdash;and great marketing programs, most of which do not occur; figures are shown to the potential franchisee that do not match reality; and then, when the franchisee gets into trouble, unreal demands are made of them. After those unfair demands are made, they are generally removed from the business. I for one commend this legislation because, if anything, that sort of unconscionable practice, which has gone on for far too long in the franchising business, needs to stop. If this legislation did nothing else but that, it would be a marvellous success. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to lend my strong support to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11857"> <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S124">Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997</XREF> . This legislation holds many benefits for a very wide range of small businesses in Australia. I intend to focus my remarks on those couple of specific areas which I believe will give a far better and fairer deal for small business operators in my electorate&mdash;and I am talking here about retail tenancy work and, in particular, fuel distributors and service station operators which have been very much at the mercy of the multinationals for far too many years. It is good to see that at last we are in a position to give some of these people a decent set of teeth so that they can protect their rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the retail tenancy reform that we are proposing, there are a number of very positive initiatives. A stronger Trade Practices Act will, at long last, start to work for small retail businesses rather than benefiting the larger operators. There will be a new law against unconscionable business conduct, taking into account the differing bargaining powers between small retailers and retail landlords. This is something that has emerged in my electorate, particularly in Cairns. In recent times, there has been an absolute proliferation of retail space. Certainly, overservicing has been suggested, and we have sufficient shopping centres in Cairns now to be able to service a population something in excess of 2&half; to three times our current population. So really we have two choices: either we have to start encouraging larger families, very quickly, with a significant migration program to Cairns or, alternatively, we have to start looking at possibly reducing our retail space by half.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very serious problem that we have there. There does not seem to be any quick fix solution in the short term. Sadly, what happens is that people get locked into retail tenancies in these large centres and they really have no choice. They get locked in and cannot get out as new centres start to open and, of course, business starts to drop off, irrespective of their ability to service their particular business just by sheer numbers. They are locked into all sorts of deals which really cause them major problems and, sadly, we see a lot of them going broke and ending 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up in our social security queues, which is something that we need to avoid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have a problem when some of the larger retail landlords, particularly, lock these people in and, for their own commercial reasons, they are not prepared to offer any compromise. Basically, they will keep them there until they are well and truly destroyed in a business sense. So it is good to see that we are actually bringing in some practical measures now that will give some protection to these small retail tenants to give them the opportunity of at least surviving in a very difficult time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also measures leading to specialised state and territory retail tenancy legislation and a nationally negotiated safety net for principles of retail tenancy legislation. All of these things are certainly going to help a lot of the small retailers in my electorate. I have to say that when we released this package we were applauded in that area. There was a massive sigh of relief. It is something that has been desperately needed for a long time. But up until very recently&mdash;and I commend the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) for the speed with which he dealt with this&mdash;there was no commitment, prior to Minister Reith, to deal with this matter. It is certainly going to assist our businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area that I think is even more important&mdash;the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), touched on it&mdash;is the issue of franchising reform. As he said, there are a number of franchises around. We see them springing up everywhere. Anybody who gets half a good idea these days puts some catchy name to it and sells it off as a franchise. Sadly, they drag in a lot of people who think that there is a business opportunity which they can make a dollar out of. Unfortunately, they pay an absolute fortune to get into it. The great marketing initiatives that are sold to these people as part of the cost are usually only reflected in the glossy brochures that are given to them. Those initiatives are about as shallow as the brochures. They are given figures that are at best very inaccurate. As a consequence, we see a lot of people and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11858"> families who go into these franchises expecting to do well out of it. At the end of the day, they are broke. The franchisor continues to sell his wares and makes a very comfortable living out of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is good to see that we have new legislation that will give legal protection to franchisees against exploitative business contact. There is certainly a new and stronger franchising code of practice, mandatory cross&hyphen;franchise systems, which are also very important, and legal recognition of the new franchising code under the Trade Practices Act. At least that will give them some protection by bringing them under the umbrella of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other areas that is absolutely critical is the stronger and mandatory oil code being underpinned by the Trade Practices Act. This will protect our oil industry franchisees. Under the amendments in the House today, the oil code, the voluntary code of practice for the oil industry, will certainly be strengthened and given legal backing under the Trade Practices Act. The amendments will provide a legal underpinning to approved codes of practice. I am really pleased that the government is prescribing the oil code as a mandatory code under the act. I think this is absolutely crucial. It will ensure that complainants will have access to remedies and sanctions contained in the act. A facilitator will be appointed to aid negotiations between relevant parties to draft a strengthening oil code. It is expected that the negotiations will be completed by the end of this year, with the legal underpinning effective in 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Strengthening the oil code will mean that family operated fuel distribution businesses will not have to suffer the same treatment as was suffered by Bill, Russell and Greg Boundy of Airvision Pty Ltd based in Cairns, a family with a 48&hyphen;year association with Mobil which turned sour in very recent times. Airvision, of which Bill, Russell and Greg Boundy are the directors and owners, were agents and contractors for Mobil at Cairns airport for 26 years&mdash;father and sons, with the father being associated with Mobil and its predecessor, Vacuum, for 48 years as an employee, agent, distributor and contractor.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Boundys were given long&hyphen;term assurances and promises by Mobil, which were discussed in great detail, about their future at the Cairns airport and the probability of managing for Mobil that company's interests in other local Queensland general aviation airports. They were given clear statements, plans and specific details about the probability of running Mobil's and the joint user's interests at the Sydney airport, to the extent of being told to buy a unit close to Sydney airport due to the frequency and length of visits to the airport. They were provided with extensive&mdash;and expensive&mdash;training to achieve the ability to manage all of the abovementioned projects. This was paid for entirely by Mobil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of the need to prepare for the expansion in an environment where Mobil informed them that contractors were the way to go, in Mobil's view, and that they would be responsible for everything, they made considerable investment in working capital on the basis of promises given to enable them to establish themselves as major contractors. A contract of $2 million per annum was thoroughly discussed and proposed to enable the full contract running of the Cairns airport, which helped the ANZ Bank approve the aforementioned increase in working capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An annual budget was prepared and agreed by Mobil and the Boundys, with the full contents being understood by both sides. This is an important fact because later on Mobil said that they did not have any idea how much the Boundys were going to be paid. An enterprise bargaining agreement negotiation was begun at Mobil's insistence, being the precursor for a new arrangement reflected in the new contract and comments made about the changed nature of the management process planned after it was completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Extensive enterprise bargaining agreement guidance was given by Mobil itself and there was evidence, the Boundys believed, of Mobil's long-term aims, contrary to declared statements that followed after that. Mobil's involvement is unusual as normally enterprise agreements are negotiated between those parties affected, the employees and the owner/ managers. The completed enterprise bargain 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11859"> ing agreement led to a significant increase in costs but this was followed by a reduction in remuneration within weeks. Subsequent to the reduction in remuneration, financial pressure was felt by the Boundys through delays in payments by Mobil, which forced the Boundys into a very difficult financial position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November 1996, the Boundys were given the option of accepting 90 days' notice, as Mobil alleged it was able to do under the signed agreement, or walking away with $100,000&mdash;a pro rata of this 90-day amount to broadly recognise Mobil's view of the profit being earned. The changed attitude appears to have developed in late 1996, when a different section of Mobil seemed to realise the long-term potential of Cairns and Sydney in the Olympics context, and the opportunity to cut out the middleman was seen. After giving the 90-day termination notice, Mobil was forced into oil code unwillingly. It required a letter to Mobil's managing director from the distributor's association, APADA, and pressure from the oil code conciliator to do so. It took several weeks to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the termination of the joint user hydrant installation business, Mobil have failed to pay outstanding invoices of around $800,000 to Airvision and made a payment of some $35,000 as a full and final settlement. Astonishingly, there was no reconciliation advice accompanying the payment. The offer made by the oil company was a minute fraction of the value of the business taken from the Boundys. The oil code conciliator recommended a significantly higher amount than the $100,000 Mobil offered, but it was still far short of the aforementioned value. However, on the production of additional diary note evidence, which it had not been expected would be needed at the time, and a submission of this evidence to the conciliator, the conciliator suspended the recommendation pending Mobil's response to the diary notes. The evidence of three named individuals in the diary notes was critical in view of the promises and statements recorded, but Mobil refused to allow them to participate in the conciliation before or after the submission of the diary notes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mobil refused to agree to or reject a direct request for further talks and subsequently ignored the conciliator's direction to attend further talks and respond to the diary notes. An offer equivalent to the conciliator's suspended recommendation was made by Mobil. The offer expired as the distributor and his association requested further conciliation meetings and were unable, in the absence of the revised conciliator's recommendation, to agree or reject the offer. It was subsequently reinstated for a fortnight at the time of Mobil's withdrawal from the conciliation process. By withdrawing in the manner that it did, Mobil ignored the conciliator's directions. Any reasonable person would consider that this action of Mobil had the potential to significantly damage the alternative dispute resolution process. Comments were received from Mobil staff at the joint user hydrant installation that Mobil expected to pay nothing to the Boundys and that the matter would go to court, taking several years. This had been said several times in recent months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conciliator has since written to Mobil stating that Mobil's failure to comply with the directions prevented him from forming a final view as to a fair and reasonable offer and suggested that, depending on Mobil's response to additional information provided, he might have found that a higher value was justified. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mobil's termination could reasonably be seen as an attempt to prevent such a possibility.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In addition to the joint user hydrant installation side of the Cairns airport, the Boundys ran an agency for Mobil in the general aviation market and have done so for 26 years. This was also terminated approximately three to four weeks after the second conciliation meeting. The grounds, I am advised, were spurious and were denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that Queensland consumer affairs records show that another Mobil distributor based in Coolangatta registered a business name for the refuelling agency in Cairns three days before the second conciliation meeting, and the Boundys were terminated a month after the meeting when Mobil took over the site and locked the Boundys out. Before and during the conciliation, Mobil 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11860"> had stated several times that they were content for the Boundys to continue as Mobil's general aviation agent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following a statement in the other place, Mobil recently have indicated that they will consider reinstating the twice lapsed offer if Airvision will consider their position. But they have not indicated any intention to abide by the oil code conciliator's directions. This whole episode involving Mobil amply demonstrates the risks of relying on voluntary conciliation when dealing with big multinational businesses that can willingly disregard the process when it suits them. Quite frankly, the thought of deregulating such organisations is frightening. The slap in the face to the alternative dispute resolution process also shows how it is a waste of time to rely on voluntary codes of conduct when the chips are really down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I spoke to Greg Boundy recently, he told me that they were absolutely distraught over what had eventuated because Mobil was a company that the family quite frankly had loved so much, as was demonstrated clearly by the length of time that the family had been associated with Mobil and their diligence in working for that company. Basically they are now unemployed and are trying to get their lives back together. It is a very sad indictment of Mobil that the Boundys have been treated this way by Mobil. It is absolute appalling. I hope that what we are doing now will certainly bring these multinationals back into line. After 48 years of association with Mobil, the Boundys have walked away with absolutely nothing but broken dreams. Since 27 October, Mobil has actually ceased communications with the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On learning of the content of this bill, the APADA, the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association, congratulated the government for producing such a well balanced and focused initiative. APADA's media release on 1 October states that they are particularly pleased that the decision has been taken to have the petroleum industry's alternative dispute resolution process strengthened and prescribed as a mandatory code under the amendments in this bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak in support of the amendments to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S124">Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997</XREF> . When we established the fair trading inquiry last year we were serious about addressing the fair trading issues head on. We knew that tough decisions&mdash;decisions squibbed by previous governments&mdash;had to be made. Our package of amendments will strengthen the Trade Practices Act so it can work for small business. Our package of measures includes: new protection for small business franchisees through a stronger and mandatory franchising code of conduct, underpinned by the Trade Practices Act; a safety net of minimum legislative standards for protection of retail tenants to be negotiated through state and territory legislation; stronger enforcement by the ACCC of small business fair trading rights, including representative legal actions on behalf of small business; small business commissioners; a code of conduct enforcement unit; funding for test cases; support for alternative dispute resolution to provide small business with quicker, less costly and more efficient remedies than traditional litigation; and support for the extension of the banking industry ombudsman scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments complement the work being done by the government in workplace relations, unfair dismissal laws, capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax and the future with taxation reform. The combined impact of these measures supports this government's commitment to small business to assist them in getting on with business. I think all of us agree that small firms need greater protection against unfair business conduct by larger firms. Small business has long held the view that the legal and administrative barriers to bringing an action under existing laws have left them little protection. A new unconscionable conduct provision has been included with these amendments. This new provision will provide meaningful legislative protection for small business against exploitative business 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11861"> conduct and inadequate disclosure of information in business dealings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All members here would know of an example where small business operators have experienced unfair conduct by other big business. In my own electorate, where we have excessive retail space per head of the population, the actions of landlords in major shopping complexes have had a serious impact on the small business owners and managers. This legislation will go a long way to addressing the types of behaviour that can be considered unconscionable conduct. The proposed new section 51AC will prohibit this behaviour for corporations against persons, other than listed public companies, or unconscionable conduct by persons against corporations. Whether the conduct is unconscionable is to be determined by examining all the circumstances of the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new section will list a number of factors to which the Federal Court of Australia may have regard in determining whether there has been a contravention of the section. Small business will have the same type of strong legal protection that is given to consumers when dealing with big business. For example, a court will be required to consider the differences in bargaining power between big and small business when deciding whether the conduct by big business is unconscionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry codes of conduct can offer flexible and efficient mechanisms to address issues of business practice. The government remains committed to voluntary codes of conduct and industry developed regulation. When voluntary codes of conduct fail and there are significant levels of undesirable behaviour in a sector, the government may prescribe a code to increase the effectiveness. The government is amending the Trade Practices Act to allow the prescription of a code or relevant provisions of a code as either mandatory or voluntary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A code of conduct enforcement unit will be established in the ACCC to enforce prescribed codes and to provide information on the operation of codes. This unit will be responsible for administration of the codes, providing advice on the codes and taking enforce 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment action. The codes will also be enforceable by private action under the Trade Practices Act. Codes will be subject to ongoing and searching evaluation. All regulations under certain circumstances will have a mandatory five&hyphen;year sunset. In the case of the franchising code of practice, for example, the government response to the fair trading inquiry will include review after three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government recognises that there is an unacceptable degree of undesirable conduct in the retail tenancy sector. The imbalance of power in tenancy relationships often gives rise to harsh outcomes for small firms. There is a disparity in the levels of protection for small tenants between, and in some cases within, state and territory jurisdictions. There is support for a new approach in this area and for the first time in over a decade we have retailers, landlords, and state, territory and federal governments all willing to work together to build a strong regulatory regime that protects legitimate interests. The federal government will support and encourage the development of further key principles that will provide additional minimum standards for retail tenancy legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government intends that a new franchising code of practice will be prescribed as a mandatory code under the Trade Practices Act, making it binding on all franchisors. An industry advisory body, the Franchising Policy Council, will be established to monitor and review the franchising code of practice and provide advice to the government on trends within the industry. The first task of the FPC will be to conduct a public review of the existing franchising code of practice with a view to strengthening its provisions, including disclosure provisions and alternative dispute resolutions. A dispute resolution adviser will be appointed to assist franchise parties to avoid disputes and to quickly resolve disputes that arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will immediately appoint two small business associate commissioners dedicated to small business issues. At the next vacancy, a full&hyphen;time small business commissioner will be appointed. The ACCC will employ a small business case officer in each state and territory to act as a liaison point 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11862"> between the ACCC and the small business community. The government will promote the inclusion of alternative dispute resolution systems in codes and make available better information on ADR for small business. The objective is to reduce the costs and time of litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government supports the banking sector extending voluntary codes of practice and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to include incorporated small businesses. A re&hyphen;examination of the interest rate premiums charged on all small business loans will occur. The government will support the extension of the industry operated banking ombudsman scheme, the banking code of practice and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to small business. All these measures go a long way in actively addressing the concerns and difficulties experienced by small business in the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operations of their work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every electorate in Australia has examples of the kinds of problems identified in the Reid report. What has been identified is extreme behaviour, and the consequences, by all players in this game. In over 200 submissions from business groups, individuals and over 50 organisations the evidence was clear and consistent. The disadvantage that small business experiences daily in going about its business in terms of market power, pricing policies and access to justice needs to be resolved. The changes to be implemented by this government affirm its belief that the problems suffered by small business can be overcome and resolved by fair and appropriate legislation. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S124">Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997</XREF>  certainly provides this place and all of Australia with one of the great contrasts with the previous government. The actions of this government in taking this bill through this House and the other place without any amendments being passed will send a very strong signal to the small business sector that there is now a government in this country which not only listens but also acts on their concerns. We have a contrast with the previous government, which had a big 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government, big union, big business bent. Now we have a government which recognises, quite rightly, that small business is definitely the engine room of our economy. After all, it accounts for over 90 per cent of all businesses in this country and for 46 per cent of the business work force. In fact, in 1995&hyphen;96 small business accounted for 65 per cent of new job creation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Moreton there is plenty of evidence to be seen that confidence is returning to the small business sector. It is showing the lead in the creation of new jobs, giving opportunities to younger Australians and also older Australians who have been out of the work force for some time. It is quite right that government, especially at the federal level, should support small business&mdash;the mums, the dads and the individuals who are prepared to put absolutely everything on the line to give it a go, to try to achieve something for themselves and, in the process, for their community and for their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Success of the individual does transfer down the line. We find plenty of examples where successful small business operators want to expand their business and the first thing they do is hire more people. So at the heart of this legislation today is the government's ongoing commitment to the creation of real jobs&mdash;not mickey mouse jobs, not jobs that are all about hiding people off the unemployment list&mdash;by giving a strong signal to the small business sector that we are fair dinkum about their concerns and want to address those concerns in the way in which we are doing through this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see the Labor Party have proposed a number of amendments&mdash;the typical sort of stunt that we expect from the previous government, the sort of thing they want us to discuss rather than talk about their record. Here we have an opposition proposing amendments that suggest that the government's response to the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> of the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology&mdash;the so&hyphen;called Reid report&mdash;is not adequate. The response is certainly about a million miles more than they ever did: 27 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11863"> inquiries in 13 years&mdash;zip results, absolutely nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, this bill also shows very clearly that in the battle, big business versus small business, the Howard government is very clearly on the side of small business. We have in the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) a minister who has a can&hyphen;do reputation, a reputation for getting on with the sensible jobs that have to be done, and this bill certainly spells that out very clearly. I have to say that people in small business in my electorate want that certainty, and for the past 18 months they have slowly but surely been gaining a greater deal of certainty than they had before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have looked back over some notes and I know that small business operators in the electorate of Moreton were feeling very down in the mouth 18 months ago. They had been promised so many starts by the previous government and got nothing; they were shown absolutely nothing as a result of all the promises of the previous government. Is it any wonder that, while they were full of great expectations from the election of the Howard government, they were still waiting to see some tangible signs? The passing of this legislation today will be the beacon on the hill for so many people in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the major benefits that this government has brought in for the small business sector. The changes to the Trade Practices Act, which are before us today,  will prohibit unconscionable conduct. They will stop, in particular, landlords screwing into the ground the aspirations of small business operators. They will prevent a situation where landlords essentially say, `There are plenty more in the queue. If particular small business operators can't keep up with our changing terms and conditions, that is okay. We don't mind if they collapse and they lose all of their possessions, their house or whatever. We don't mind. That is their problem. It is not ours. We'll put extra strong conditions on the leases despite what our previous agreements have been. So what if there is a cost to society of a bankruptcy? So what if there is a cost of a family destroyed and their aspirations dashed? So what 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> if jobs aren't being created as a result of these aspirations being dashed? That's okay. We'll find somebody else who will come on and be mug enough to put their house on the line and go into small business.' Those sorts of practices are going to stop as a result of the legislation before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are offering new protection for small business franchisees through a mandatory and stronger franchising code of conduct and oil code, a safety net of minimum legislative standards to protect retail tenants and a stronger enforcement by the ACCC of small business fair trading rights, including representative legal actions on behalf of small business. We are going to give small businesses a role in the process and a say that they have not had before. This is very good news. I must say that, when one looks at all the various provisions of the bill, it makes one feel pleased to have played a small part in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I was not a member of the committee which drafted the report which the minister so quickly responded to, as a private member in this place one of my first actions as the member for Moreton was to start a small business advisory group in my electorate. I have several very good chambers of commerce which operate in my electorate. The current president of the South-West Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, Scott Charlton, and the former president, Peter Janssen, are strong supporters. The former president of the Southside Chamber of Commerce, Geoff Curtis, and the current president, Ted Heslin, are strong supporters of what this government is doing as far as small business reforms are concerned. The Archerfield Airport Chamber of Commerce is also a strong supporter of what this government is doing. They know from their own experiences and from talking to members of their chamber what a failure the previous government was as far as small business was concerned. As in so many things, the Labor Party tested their particular interest in a sector by how much money they threw at the problem. If throwing money at problems solved those problems, then maybe we would not still have half the problems we inherited from the previous government. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11864">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party used the approach: `We'll give you this money if you tell us this.' In other words, strings were attached to anything the Labor Party did for small business. There was an invasion of a business's privacy; there was a complete disclosure of transactions. All of these things had to be listed on complicated forms which small business had to fill in if they were to get any assistance from government. Small businesses do not need extra money in direct grants from government; small businesses need government out of the way. And that is what this government is all about. It is a major contrast with Labor exposed by this particular bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One particular example I can offer is the way quality assurance is being used as a means of restricting small business. Quality assurance is very costly for many small businesses to undertake. It is all very well for a bureaucracy to impose quality assurance as a means to determine whether or not government departments may purchase something from a small business, but at the end of the day the cost of getting that quality assurance is a cost that many small businesses find difficult to bear. A business would probably be better off measured by whether or not it was capable of providing goods and services rather than whether or not it had the paperwork set out right. That is one of the things that concerns my small business advisory group, the Moreton Electorate Small Business Advisory Group, MESBAG. This group has become very well known throughout the electorate of Moreton. I must praise the honorary secretary, Geoff Wilson, for his role in ensuring that the message is spread far and wide and that the opportunities are there for small businesses in my electorate to play a role in what we have before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the so&hyphen;called Reid report was tabled in this place, we convened a number of public meetings in our electorate. One on 28 July particularly springs to mind. The member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) came to the electorate of Moreton to address 100 or so small business people from the south side of Brisbane about the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. The meeting passed a resolution 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> calling on the government to implement the thrust of the recommendations of the Reid report on small business without delay. You can imagine that when you are challenged by your electorate to make sure that the executive of the government you support gets on with the job the pressure is on you. As a private member in this place, I was very pleased with the response of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. His approach in this matter, the consultation he undertook with people like me and the fact that he listened to our views and our demands that we not delay any longer the implementation of the thrust of the recommendations of the Reid report was appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have before us, in almost world record time, is a bill which essentially captures the aspirations of the Reid report, a bill which puts out very fairly and squarely some straightforward and easy to understand amendments to the Trade Practices Act to ensure small business are given the right signals. I am still amazed at how quickly the minister was able to get all of this together. I think that it proves wrong the assertion we often hear that government moves very slowly. If you contrast the fact that in 13 years of the previous government there were 27 inquiries and nothing happened, is it any wonder that people were awfully cynical about whether anything was actually going to occur as a result of the Reid report? On the day of the luncheon meeting, 28 July, many people in my electorate believed that this would just be another report, like the Schacht report or the Beddall report, that would lie buried under dust, lost forever, sunk without trace. That was the previous government's style. Why wouldn't it be the style of this government? So, when small business in my electorate get together and pass a motion demanding action and get it, they are delighted to think that this government is getting on with the job and providing them with the sort of lead that they want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important for all members in this place to note the viability of having a direct consultative link, such as the advisory group that I established, with small business. The Moreton Electorate Small Business Advisory 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11865"> Group meets every six to eight weeks. They give me some pretty blunt feedback from time to time, feedback which I pass on in blunt fashion to the ministers responsible. Those ministers to their great credit offer me answers to the concerns expressed by small business in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of those concerns and issues that were raised last year and earlier this year included the abuse of market power by large businesses. Guess what? We are doing something about it in this bill. They were very concerned that, for instance, the Democrats and the minor parties in the Senate were going to delay the passing of the industrial relations legislation. Small business will not accept excuses from the government about these sorts of things. Well, the government got on with that and we are getting on with other amendments that will make life easier for small business operators. They were also very concerned about the way that monopolies, particularly government based monopolies such as the Queensland Electricity Board, treat small business customers from time to time. Those sorts of matters are also dealt with in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the main things they were very concerned about was confidence. They want the government to act. They want to know that there is a lead there for them to follow. More importantly, they do not need comments from those opposite who are putting down the economy, putting down the efforts of the government and trying to talk Australia down. We all need in each of our electorates a small business sector willing to invest in itself, willing to show up&mdash;not begrudgingly but enthusiastically&mdash;every day to encourage more customers through the door. Customers themselves need some sort of certainty and confidence before they go and spend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, through its actions, not just in this bill but in other pieces of legislation, has provided the signs and the signals and the policy responses to ensure that people should feel confident about investing in themselves. Be it superannuation, be it lower interest rates, be it lower inflation, there are many good signals in our communities now. The good news is that we are starting to see 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> signs of a very strong recovery across Australia. I must admit that in south&hyphen;east Queensland it has probably been toughest of all, but in recent months again there is bright light shining on the horizon. I find, from keeping in constant touch with small business operators, that people are starting to hire. I remember that back in August one chap said to me, `I do not know what has happened, but people are starting to come in, people are starting to spend money.' Five weeks later he rang me and said, `You know that trend of people spending more money? It has continued, and I have just hired another staff member.' He had three people on his books and now he has four. That is a massive percentage increase in employment numbers. If that were to be repeated across Australia, there would be no unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why small business is vital, and that is why this government has acted. We have had a two&hyphen;pronged approach to running Australia. Before the election we talked about it. One was to encourage and nurture the role of the family, whatever form that takes. The other one was to inspire a small business led recovery of our ailing economy. This government had kept faith with both of those tenets, both of those basic approaches to running this country. What is good is that we are now starting to see small business in this country respond to the leads we have offered and respond to the encouragement that we have given and are giving as a result of this legislation today. I am pleased to think that the cabinet, in view of all the pressures which can be brought to bear on the deliberations and all the considerations that cabinet have to soak up before they make decisions on matters, chose sides on the battle of small business versus big business. They say very clearly to those at the bigger end of town that those little blokes need to be encouraged&mdash;the mums, the dads, the individuals who give it a go, who are willing to put it all on the line to construct a business operation&mdash;to not only involve themselves and provide themselves with personal viability but also time hire others and put other people who are currently out of work into jobs. I think it is great that the cabinet have taken the side of small business, because it is a vital side to take.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11866">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate, we now have a further challenge ahead of us, and it is in keeping with provisions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New deal: fair deal</EMPHASIS> announcement from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, a month or so ago. That is the convening of a business incubator; an incubator that is all about businesses helping other businesses helping other businesses&mdash;everybody working together. One thing that is for certain is that businesses often fail as a result of poor education, as a result of poor understanding of their circumstances and obligations or as a result of poor information or uncertain access to information. These are all matters contained within this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The business incubator concept being spearheaded by Peter Weightman and by Geoff Wilson in the Mount Gravatt Central area, which in fact forms the border between my electorate and that of the honourable member for Griffith (Mr McDougall), will give a strong lead to small businesses in my area and will give them strong assistance. We can do something as a practical local measure encompassing the provisions of this bill and encompassing the provisions of other legislative means this government has brought forward to this place to ensure that small businesses are not just created and then die some months later, with all the personal losses that result. If we can give small businesses the wherewithal, the encouragement, the backup, the facilities, the support&mdash;however you wish to describe it&mdash;then I think we are going to do something strong about stopping small business failure before it happens. This bill certainly does deal with the preventive side of small business failure, and that is one of the many reasons why it should be supported today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say in closing that I was pleased to have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), visit my electorate recently to talk to small business people about just these matters. I know, from what the member for Mitchell has said to me since, that he was greatly encouraged by the enthusiasm that small business operators, the chamber of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commerce and my small business advisory group in the Moreton electorate are showing. That great enthusiasm is backed up by the fact that they know they have a government in Canberra that is tuned in to them, that has mechanisms in place to listen and legislation to prove that they have listened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also thank the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, who also visited my electorate the other week to talk directly to small business people. Some of them are very impressive operators. Some of them have dozens of people on their books and turn over millions of dollars a year. Others are simply mums and dads who are sustaining themselves and their families and maybe one or two others. I hope that early next year we get the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, into the electorate to see how his department can marry into this business incubator concept, which I think will take the spirit of the bill which is before us today and actually apply it in a practical, local way. For so many reasons the bill we have before us today is the beacon on the hill that small business has wanted. It is yet another positive sign from this government that we are fair dinkum about small business and we are fair dinkum about the creation of real jobs in this country. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like all other government members, it is with a great deal of personal and collective pride that I stand to make a contribution to the debate on the bill before the House, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S124">Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997</XREF> . It has been a long time coming and it confers a great deal of credit on all those who played a part in ensuring it has been presented to the parliament in the form that it is in. I should make the point that there is a stark contrast in terms of numbers between the contributors to the debate from the government side and those from the opposition side. You have, over the several days of debate on this legislation, but a handful of Labor Party members contributing but dozens of government members contributing to this very important debate. It is a bill which sets 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11867"> a new framework for security and fair trading for small business into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a sense of shame that deters many members of the opposition from participating in the debate, given that over their 13 years in government there were, believe it or not, some 17 reports on fair trading, with nothing to show for them. As we have so often interpreted from the opposition's policy bleatings, everything was going to be done in their 14th year in power. The budget deficit was to be eradicated. New legislation ensuring fair trading was to be brought about. Every time we ask a question as to why they never acted at any time during their 13 years in government in regard to one aspect of government administration or another, we are told, `It was on the agenda.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was never on the agenda that small businesses be given powers under the Trade Practices Act against the predatory behaviour of larger businesses. It took a Liberal&hyphen;National Party government to bring about, very quickly, introduction of legislation of this kind. After all, but weeks after coming into government we established, in May 1996, the fair trading inquiry under the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. It delivered its report 12 months later in May 1997, and now, in early December you have legislation before the House. Normally a government delays its response to parliamentary reports on controversial, difficult or complex areas of policy for a year or longer. Within a few months we have responded, drafted legislation and introduced it into the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should say that it is well acknowledged around the parliament that the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), deserves great credit for the role he played in conjunction with his colleagues on that committee. It was a very balanced and creditable report that was handed down and one upon which the government could act. The member for Bendigo did not regard his responsibilities as ending with the delivery of the report. Instead, he followed it through the various processes of government decision making so that, when the cabinet finally decided the matter to bring forward to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the joint parties of the government, the member for Bendigo had been very intimately involved. Indeed, it is true to say that there are very few of us who have an opportunity to stamp a major area of government administration or policy as the member for Bendigo has this one. Also those on the committee with him can share in the deep satisfaction of having radically changed the law for the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not, though, as if the government were waiting for the delivery of this report to act on its pre&hyphen;election commitments to small business. Rather, on coming into government in March 1996, we hit the ground running, to the benefit of small business. Above all else, small business tells me that the five cuts in interest rates over the last 20 months have been of enormous benefit to them. Most small businesses have heavy borrowings&mdash;so much so that, for a $100,000 loan, the interest rate cuts will put $2,000 into the pocket of a small business person by way of interest savings. That is very significant. Interest rates are the lowest since the early 1970s. We did not just stop there, though. The purpose of reducing the government deficit to the point where we will be in surplus next financial year was to benefit homebuyers, individuals taking out personal loans, small businesses, farmers, big businesses, whatever. Small businesses have benefited enormously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also did a great deal more. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made a major statement on small business in March this year, we were able to announce a whole range of measures, particularly in regard to cutting red tape. We delivered in concrete terms. For instance, the Australian Bureau of Statistics paperwork has been cut by 20 per cent for small business, with simpler forms to fill out. The tax office is reducing the paperwork burden on small business, and this is going to be done in conjunction and consultation with accounting bodies and small business groups, so as to make sure that those reforms are practical and based on the needs of small businesses themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax office has already delivered in this regard, although there is still a fair way to go. Those 300 small businesses that have an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11868"> annual withholding obligation of $25,000 or less under the pay&hyphen;as&hyphen;you&hyphen;earn system, prescribed payments and reportable payments systems will have the choice to remit these payments on a quarterly rather than a monthly basis. By July next year, a single registration process will be in place for the initial registration requirements of the tax office, the Australian Securities Commission, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. That is terribly important because it is not just the expense that is lumped onto small business in satisfying the statutory or regulatory requirements of government but the time that they simply do not have. What time is made available almost invariably eats into a small business person's personal time over weekends or late at night. That is what drives us&mdash;an easing of the cost and time burdens of complying with government regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax office goes further. Small businesses can now make voluntary tax payments at any time by using the payment in advance system, which is going to help the cash flow management. The number of tax compliance statements are going to be reduced, creating, for instance, a single form for all indirect tax obligations. Under us, small companies and small instalment taxpayers will have more time to lodge their returns and pay liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have done even more. Again before the handing down of the fair trading report in May 1997, we cut fringe benefits tax. As of 1 April 1997 fringe benefits tax was made fairer. Taxi fares and employee car parking provided by small businesses on their premises were both exempted. Small businesses which had less than $5,000 in taxable fringe benefits in the previous year can now pay the same tax in the following year, without having to keep any records.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cut capital gains tax, a major reform which is of enormous benefit to small businesses and to farmers. Under us small businesses are able to gain relief from capital gains tax when they sell a business to buy another business. Up to $500,000 from the sale of a business to fund retirement will be exempt from capital gains tax.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We reformed Labor's unfair dismissal law, which was an enormous disincentive to small business employing people. We would have gone even further by giving all small businesses employing fewer than 15 people a total exemption, but it was blocked by Labor in the Senate. May they be held accountable for that discriminatory act against small business. Many on their own side have acknowledged that Labor's unfair dismissal law was a disincentive to employment, so we acted on that. We have also ensured that there are fairer procedures to obtain government business, because we do not want small and medium sized businesses discriminated against when they tender for government contracts. We are developing procedures that are not too complex or that unfairly benefit big business with all of their inherent resources to gain an unfair advantage in tendering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are committed to contracting out many government services to the private sector, which obviously provides extra opportunities for small business. We have also looked at reforms for small business finance. We have changed the prudential requirements to let banks invest five per cent of their core capital in small to medium sized businesses. There are also exemptions to fundraising provisions of the Corporations Law to help small business raise capital. We are committed&mdash;almost maniacally so&mdash;to small business and believe that you must provide incentive and give reward to those who put their capital and the security of their families on the line. These are people who take a risk, and the community at large benefits because they employ people and pay tax. It is, after all, principally small business which will be the solution to the unemployment problem in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the specific legislation before the House, I wish to concentrate my remarks on the issue of codes of practice and, more specifically, on the oil code. Under the legislation, there is a new provision which allows industry designed codes of practice, in whole or in part, to be legally underpinned and to be made mandatory under the Trade Practices Act and enforced, in the event of a breach, as a breach of the act itself. This new reform 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11869"> provides small business with dual advantages: the benefit of participating in the design and formation of industry regulations addressing unfair conduct and the security of knowing that mandated codes or provisions of codes can be directly enforced under the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government remains committed to codes of conduct and industry developed regulation, but where voluntary codes failed and there was continuing unfair behaviour we believed it necessary to give legal recognition to a code. Therefore, the Trade Practices Act will now allow prescription of industry and consumer developed codes of practice as mandatory codes or voluntary codes with enforceable provisions. These new codes will remain flexible, efficient and appropriately designed regulations so as to meet the changes that occur in any industry sector. Breach of a prescribed code will give complainants access to the remedies and sanctions contained in the Trade Practices Act without&mdash;it is important that I stress this&mdash;the need to prove a breach of another section of the act. Small business will then have the capacity to influence the substance of industry regulation by participation in code development as well as the security of the legal recognition of those codes. This is very important in regard to the oil code, the dispute resolution mechanism previously entered into voluntarily by participants in the oil industry, namely, the oil companies, the petrol distributors association and the Service Station Association under the banner of the MTAA, the Motor Trades Association of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the oil code has had deficiencies in the past and did not enjoy the full confidence of all of the participants; so much so that it has not been operating since the middle of last year. However, given the new security and fairness inherent in the government's Trade Practices Act reforms, the parties are now coming together again with the aid of a facilitator to draft a strengthened oil code. As announced by the government, should a facilitator be unable to complete the task, or where there are still outstanding matters not agreed upon or resolved, an arbitrator will be appointed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that the oil code be completed as expeditiously as possible because there are enormous changes under way in the petrol industry. It is commonly agreed that of the 9,000 service stations, several thousand&mdash;I have heard the figure 3,000 but I have also heard the figure 5,000&mdash;must exit the industry so that the remaining service stations can attract a higher volume and therefore a greater profit margin, which will allow the passing on of lower petrol prices to consumers. That necessarily involves a fair bit of pain for a great many individuals and family businesses, and it has to be handled sensitively and with full regard to the rapidly changing nature of the industry. That is why the oil code, which introduces a legislated fairness, comes into play. Given the goodwill and openness that the parties are pledging themselves to, I believe that oil code can be completed satisfactorily, and it is very important that it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the parties to the oil code should have the confidence to rely on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, to administer and enforce the new system for prescribed codes, given that a code of conduct enforcement unit will be created within the ACCC. So it is not as if the government is leaving anything to chance; quite the opposite. We believe that any prescribed code needs that enforcement capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In drawing to a conclusion, I would again like to congratulate the large numbers of government members who have been involved in bringing us to this point. I have already spoken of the chairman of the industry committee of the parliament, the member for Bendigo, and his colleagues on that committee. Also, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) deserves our thanks and congratulations. He was assisted in that task by his predecessor, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), the then Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, who laid the groundwork for a very successful resolution of this whole issue of fair trading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to have been part of a government that has introduced such landmark 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11870"> legislation for the benefit of small business. It follows a line of reforms that we have undertaken since coming to government which have flowed on to small business.

Not that there is always a guarantee that all small businesses can succeed or flourish. We know that the marketplace is the final arbitrator or determinant of a small business's survivability. But what we can do as a government is to lower the taxation, minimise the paperwork and offer protection against unfair conduct by larger companies or suppliers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a simple fact that small business is the backbone of the Australian economy and a vital generator of economic growth. Small business employs around 3.5 million people, 45 per cent of Australia's work force, and its success is imperative to Australia's economic future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government was elected on a platform of providing real assistance to small business, reversing the years of neglect by Labor and stimulating growth in employment in the sector. The government's efforts are fundamentally focused on getting the economic fundamentals right, bringing interest rates down, providing direct assistance through capital gains tax relief and reducing the paperwork and compliance burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have made advances, but more needs to be done to revitalise the small business sector. One of small business's major areas of concern for many years has been the issue of unfair business conduct, particularly by big business towards small business. Through its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New deal: fair deal</EMPHASIS> package for small business, which was released at the end of September, the government is tackling this problem head on, replacing the interminable procrastination so characteristic of Labor's term in office with a realistic and positive program of action.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's fair trading package was developed in response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS>. I join other members in complimenting the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) on the superb job he did in this report. The report was commissioned by the government as one of its first acts, and as a first step towards delivering on our election commitments to address a range of business conduct issues of concern to small business. After a detailed investigation by the committee, the report concluded the concern about unfair business conduct towards small business not only was justified but has the potential to impact heavily on the health of the small business sector and on the Australian economy and society more generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New deal: fair deal</EMPHASIS> package is designed to address these problems through a range of important measures, some of which are dealt with in the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 , currently before the House. I do think it is worth stressing that the proposals for reform contained in this bill make up only part of a much broader package of reform which is, of itself, only part of the coalition's platform of assistance for small business. This is a fact which the opposition, in seeking to diminish the significance of the bill, seems determined to overlook. The bill is about correcting a fairly clear&hyphen;cut example of market failure, about dealing with a situation where the free market delivers a sub&hyphen;optimal outcome. In the economic utopia beloved by economists, under conditions of perfect competition, all players in the market have full and equal knowledge of market conditions, they all fully understand the terms and conditions of a contract and its implications, they can readily assess the benefits to them of any contract they enter into, they are aware of the full run of prices in the market and they know what alternatives are available to any individual contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, of course, a fact that the Australian marketplace does not resemble the economist's utopia. Its economic actors are individuals and businesses with limited capacities 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11871"> and limited knowledge. Moreover, it is in the very nature of these things that the limits experienced by some, particularly smaller economic actors, are much greater than the limits experienced by others, particularly larger ones. The result, identified so starkly by the fair trading report, is a market in which small firms frequently experience difficulty in their dealings with more powerful firms, including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">having little or no ability to negotiate terms of the contract (often pro&hyphen;forma . . . contracts are used) . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">inadequate disclosure of relevant and important commercial information which the weaker party should be aware of before entering the transaction</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">inadequate and unclear disclosure of important terms of the contract particularly those which are weighted against the weaker party. This can occur through:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the technical wording of the document</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The economic and social costs of these difficulties in terms of business failure, lost employment, wasted resources, stress, marriage breakdown and poor health are beyond accurate measurement; but they are certainly sub&hyphen;optimal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to these very real and very serious problems, the government is seeking to make changes to the Trade Practices Act 1974 to provide greater protection to small business against unfair business conduct. Specifically, the act will be amended to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prohibit unconscionable conduct in relation to certain small business transactions and to provide for industry codes of practice to be prescribed and enforced. I think it is worth while looking at each of these provisions in turn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The notion of unconscionable conduct is not a new one. Indeed, it has a long history as an important element of common law doctrines of equity. In the Australian context, through judgments such as Blomley v. Ryan and the Commercial Bank of Australia v. Amadio, it has come to be applied to situations where one party to a contract has a special disadvantage, the other party knows or ought to know of that special disadvantage and the stronger party takes advantage of the weaker party's special disadvantage. The meaning of special disadvantage has in turn been interpreted as including, amongst other things, circumstances as diverse as poverty, sickness, age, lack of education, infirmity, illiteracy and drunkenness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, while such a doctrine may appear very broad in its potential application, it is in fact quite limited and deals only with the process by which a contract is negotiated, not with the substance of any contract actually entered into. The result has been that common law unconscionability has been difficult to establish, particularly in the context of commercial transactions. Over time, parliaments at both state and federal levels have legislatively codified and extended doctrines dealing with unconscionable conduct, made available legislatively specified remedies for affected parties and provided for government bodies to take on representative actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the federal level, the first step in this process was the inclusion in the Trade Practices Act in 1986 of significantly broader unconscionable conduct provisions for the protection of consumers. These new provisions prohibited unconscionable conduct and outlined, but did not limit, the range of considerations which could be taken into account by a court when considering whether a transaction between a corporation and a consumer was unconscionable. Under the provisions, in determining unconscionability 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11872"> a court was now enabled to take into account a variety of factors, including the relative bargaining positions of the corporation and the consumer, whether conditions which the consumer was required to comply with were necessary, whether the consumer was able to understand any documents relating to the deal, whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on the consumer, and the amount for which and the circumstances under which the consumer could have acquired identical goods elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second step in the process of codifying and extending the common law doctrine of unconscionability into Commonwealth law came in 1992 with the attempt to build into the Trade Practices Act, as well as specific consumer protections, a general catch-all unconscionability provision applicable to other transactions. This provision granted no more protection in real terms than does the common law. However, it did open up the possibility of seeking, in circumstances where unconscionable conduct was established, the remedies prescribed in the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, it enabled the then Trade Practices Commission&mdash;now the ACCC&mdash;to take representative actions on behalf of business, which until this time had no option but to pursue cases of unconscionable conduct through the legal system themselves. This latter aspect of the reform was particularly important to small business, given the relative disparity between their ability to litigate and that of the larger corporations against which they would be likely to mount an action claiming unconscionable conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this move was probably well intentioned, the provision was never really likely to provide the kind of protection from unfair business conduct that businesses, particularly small business, were seeking. As one expert commentator noted at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business can take little comfort from the introduction of the new s.51AA of the Trade Practices Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> s. 51AA may afford the basis for relief provided the facts are such as to constitute the equitable doctrine of unconscionability. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this is the case there may be scope for the Commission to intervene,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> but while ever "special disability" and "special disadvantage" are seen as factors likely to arise only in extraordinary circumstances</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> then the new Part has added little.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Such criticism should not really have surprised the then Labor government, as its own committee of inquiry&mdash;the Beddall committee&mdash;had recommended in 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provisions of the Trade Practices Act concerning unconscionable conduct which currently apply to transactions involving consumers be extended to include small business transactions including retail/commercial tenancy agreements, where small business is disadvantaged in the same way as a consumer in its dealings with other parties.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Just as the Labor Party should not have been surprised by the expert criticisms of their amendments to the Trade Practices Act, they would not really have been surprised by their failure to address the problems to which they were directed. Small business continued to report difficulties in terms of harsh and unconscionable conduct in their business dealings, and the Labor Party satisfied themselves by looking on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any number of the Labor Party speakers in this debate have tried to show that when in government they were active in the area of providing protection for small business from harsh business conduct. I think it is important to note that activity is no substitute for effectiveness, and the number and tone of the submissions received by the Reid committee show that they were far from effective on this front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a stark contrast to Labor's half&hyphen;hearted legislative changes that the coalition government has extended in full the existing consumer protection provisions to small business, providing real protection for the sector and ensuring the rules under which they operate are fair and that there will be proper redress available to those when the rules are broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, I think it is significantly to the government's credit that it has managed to effectively and simply limit the application of its new measures to small business conducting normal small business transactions. Anybody who has had any experience with the attempts to generate policies for small business will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11873"> attest that it is often very difficult to limit the application of small business initiatives to small business itself, and the cost implications of a failure to do so can be great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second function of the  Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997  is to set a framework within the Trade Practices Act for the development of specific industry codes of practice, adherence to which can be made mandatory and compliance with which will be enforceable. Like the doctrine of unconscionability, industry codes are not a new concept. They have been in operation for years, most notably the franchising code of practice. Unfortunately, however, like the doctrine of unconscionability, in their present voluntary and unbinding form they have often failed to provide adequate protection for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the franchising code, which the Reid committee looked at in some detail, the committee was informed by the former chairman of the Franchising Council, Mr Gardini, that the code suffered from a number of serious weaknesses: coverage of the code was approximately 65 per cent; the council was unable to inform the marketplace of those who were removed from the register of compliance; the council was prevented by the code itself from removing franchisors from the register of compliance when they breached the standard of conduct provisions in the code, and section 51AA of the Trade Practices Act did not effectively underpin the same standard of conduct provisions contained in the code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Gardini further informed the committee that a recent survey had shown that some 25 per cent of franchisees were currently in litigation or even major disputation with their franchisees, while 50 per cent of the franchisors surveyed did not have any formal processes for dispute handling and resolution. These sorts of facts are indicative of a system which is not working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry self-regulation is a noble objective. When it works properly it can provide for very effective mechanisms for maintaining standards of conduct in an industry. However, when self-regulation leads to substantial non- 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">compliance, other avenues do need to be investigated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Reid committee recommended that the Commonwealth enact specific franchising legislation. The government has elected not to go down this path, but rather to create a framework within the Trade Practices Act whereby industry codes of practice could be made compulsory and compliance with them made mandatory. In my mind this represents a stronger solution even than that recommended by the committee as it provides for a compulsory and binding franchising code and will also enable other industry codes to be incorporated without the need to pass specific legislation some time in the future. Further, because it will involve various industries in the drafting of the codes of practice it will capture many of the benefits of self-regulatory systems, which would be largely lost if legislation had to be enacted each time a code was to be made mandatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislative amendments provided in the bill are important and positive changes which will help to address the problems identified by the Reid committee's fair trading report. As I have already mentioned, however, they are only part&mdash;albeit a very important one&mdash;of the government's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New deal: fair deal</EMPHASIS> package. The package also includes a safety net of minimum legislative standards for protection of retail tenants to be negotiated through state and territory legislation, stronger enforcement by the ACCC of small business fair trading rights, support for alternative dispute resolution to provide small business with quicker, less costly and more efficient remedies than traditional court litigation and support for the extension of the banking industry ombudsman scheme to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this comprehensive package will constitute a landmark for small business. It stands in stark contrast to the inaction and ineffectiveness of the former Labor government. Together with the government's broader economic policies and our reforms aimed at freeing the small business sector from the burden of excessive regulation, it will help to ensure that small business is given a fair go and the confidence to grow and to create jobs. It is good for the small business sector and it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11874"> is good for Australia. I would like to congratulate the member for Bendigo for his vital part in bringing the package forward and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) for  acting so speedily in introducing it to the House. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

We all appreciate the role that he is playing and the activity that he is undertaking. Today, because of the time pressures for other business around the parliament, I want to focus on only one aspect of the current circumstances confronting small business that needs to be addressed. It is not a particularly partisan point. It is not directly related to a criticism of this bill or the amendment. It relates to the legal framework in general and to some matters that we all, as members, need to consider. It arises from issues raised with me, not in my capacity as shadow minister but as member for Canberra, by some local citizens in the ACT community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The background to it is an issue that would be very familiar to anyone who has spoken in this debate. Big companies and governments enter into complex contractual arrangements which tend to have the effect of making it very difficult for small business, for consumers, for individual citizens and for employees to get effective redress for their problems. Often the contracts are entered into for other reasons. It is not always a deliberate contract to make the redress difficult, but it has that practical effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particular constituency examples I want to refer to relate to people in their status as employees of these corporations, but it illustrates a wider problem that relates not only to employees but also to small business doing business with the larger corporations and with government and to individual citizens. We have here the case of individuals who have legal rights of redress established in the law denied the opportunity to give effect to those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rights by an series of artificial devices and contractual relationships established. The capacity to establish these contracts and devices is not particularly the responsibility of this government, nor are the arrangements necessarily ones that, on their face, have anything wrong with them, but their impact for the citizen, for the employee, for the small business customer of the larger corporation or the government creates the potential for unfair consequences to arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ironically, in other debates in this chamber, on which I will not transgress, the particular example I have relates to a problem with unfair dismissal. But it has nothing to do with the complex question of small business exemption or any of those matters about which we have contention in this place and which is the subject of another bill. The circumstance is that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs here in the ACT contracted Telstra to provide telephone reception services. Telstra contracted Western Staff Service to provide the employees to operate that function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What occurred is that Telstra acted in a way, with regard to those employees, that is clearly open to challenge under the unfair dismissal laws, including the unfair dismissal laws of this government. It is not an issue about the nature of the unfair dismissal laws, and I do not prejudge how the commission would have found in the matter if it had properly got before them. But what happened is that these people were denied access to any tribunal to hear their matter&mdash;and for all the representations I have made, they are still being denied access to any form of redress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industrial Relations Commission has found&mdash;and, in my view, correctly found&mdash;that these women, these constituents, are not employees of Telstra, that they are still on the books of Western Staff Service; it is just that they have no work. The work they did for Western Staff Service was conducted on behalf of Telstra. But Telstra said that they no longer wanted those people, for reasons which are challengeable. If Telstra had done it directly, they would clearly have had a case. They may not have won, but that is another issue for another day. But the nature of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11875"> contractual arrangements entered into, firstly, by the department but, in this instance, most fundamentally by Telstra, has denied these people access to the forums of justice in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this instance, as I said, it is not a criticism of the law relating to unfair dismissals established by this government&mdash;of course, we all know I have some disagreements with that&mdash;because this law would have been adequate to deal with their case if they had got access, but the contractual arrangement denies them access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have tried, behind the scenes, to get a review, without success. I want to say here today that Telstra should review this case and the case of these two women and they should look at their practices overall in this regard. What I want to draw to the attention of the House is the way in which these sorts of arrangements&mdash;and they are not unique to that department or to Telstra&mdash;can undermine the capacity of individuals to have fair access to their legal rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might argue that the government has undermined its capacity to resolve this matter because, with its one-third sale of Telstra, it no longer has the same capacity to deal with employee type circumstances in the way it once did. But, whatever you say about that, Telstra now has certain obligations to minority shareholders that constrain its capacity to act in some of these matters. But Telstra still has its civic responsibility as a corporation&mdash;and it has people who I know are honourable people as senior executives, including the chief executive, Frank Blount&mdash;and I want to ask them to look at this matter and to consider their civic responsibilities as a corporation to these two individuals and overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important also that the government look overall at the potential for these overlapping contractual arrangements to create problems for not only employees and citizens but also small business. The Ombudsman has raised a not dissimilar matter in her concern with regard to contracting out and accountability and its impact on citizens and small business entering into those contracts. There are a range of issues here; many of them go 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to questions of fair trading and trade practices but they go to other matters as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, I have sought to resolve this matter outside the parliament, without success. Therefore, I raise it here today in the hope that this debate will be a catalyst to Telstra and others to act in the way that reasonably they should in resolving this important question.</PARA></SPEECH>

We have heard plenty of rhetoric in this place over the years about the problems of small business and of the bid by governments to support small businesses&mdash;and not to be too disparaging about it, that is a good thing. As a former small businessman myself, let me say that it is encouraging to know that politicians from all sides of the fence are showing realistic concern about this sector's performance. After all, they express realistic knowledge that nine out of 10 new jobs in Australia are now generated by small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to face the fact that the former Hawke and Keating governments had at times an appalling track record when it came to their support for small businesses. Members on the other side from the Labor Party are attempting to skip, trip and stumble to try to hide the fact that their 17 inquiries into fair trading and unfair business practices against small business&mdash;yes, 17 inquiries in 13 years&mdash;flowed under the bridge without legislative action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a fact verified very well by people such as the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) on many occasions both within this House and during the debate generally over fair trading matters. Of course, it was the member for Bendigo who provided the excellent chairmanship for the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia </EMPHASIS>by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. Being a member of that inquiry myself, I must 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11876"> reflect for a moment on another member of that inquiry, the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), and some of his direct commentary on this bill and in the Hunter media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Newcastle seems to have taken a real shine to me in the House recently, presumably in an effort to keep me on my toes. But for him to have the hide to try to point the bone over small business policy and the strategic direction of this government in dealing with the affairs of small business takes a lot of cheek. Clearly, he needs something of a reality check, when instead he should be showing real concern and giving a voice to many small businesses and enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget the many small businesses that struggled throughout the greater Hunter for a lion's share of the 1980s and then had to cope with the recession we apparently had to have in the early 1990s. In that time in the Hunter a few things happened to enterprise. The member for Newcastle did not kick and scream hard enough against the government of the day to try to nut out a better deal&mdash;a better series of outcomes for businesses and jobs. He was not alone. The members for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) and, of recent times, the former member for Paterson, all stood in silence while the last post was played for those who were buried under the burden of red tape, high interest rates, unfair dismissal claims, high inflation and a lack of political leadership in the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These members stood by the graveside of small and medium businesses and watched without a word. Their silence was not just restricted to small&hyphen; to medium&hyphen;sized businesses; there was a stone wall of silence when BHP reduced its numbers from over 13,000 to under 3,000. This very action was in part responsible for the Hunter having a three to four per cent higher unemployment figure than the New South Wales or national average, something I am sure they are very proud of!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out to this House the following: the state dockyards shutdown; the collapse of Carrington Slipways; textile manufacturers Rundles all but hit the wall, as many other 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> textile companies did; we lost any hope of getting the frigates; and new exciting industries such as defence industry and tourism did not meet the opportunities that are now being presented. All of this occurred despite the presence of the member for Newcastle doing his apparent bit for enterprise in the seat of Newcastle&mdash;not to forget his cohorts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hunter has suffered both physically within the region, and perhaps just as poignant in the eyes of the rest of Australia is that enterprise, large and small, was not the goer in the Hunter that it could be in many other places. That is not entirely true, of course; many good private and public infrastructure projects have been fostered, as has development, when not hampered at times by the ludicrous decisions by some local government authorities. I must say that Newcastle Council comes quickly to mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Add to that scenario the record commercial interest rates&mdash;as high as 24 per cent at their peak; the introduction of capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax legislation, directly affecting small businesses; unfair levels for the provisional tax uplift factor; reaffirmation of the anachronistic 19th century style industrial relations laws and the unfair dismissals provided therein; the implementation of the incredulous unfair dismissals legislation, which was about as anti-small business in its intent as you can get; and, of course, no substantive fair trading reform relief&mdash;and we can see that small business has had it particularly tough in the Hunter, perhaps more so than in many other regions around Australia. Things had to change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Delivering a new deal&mdash;a fair deal&mdash;on fair trading is but one part of the government's greater plan for small business, which includes: delivering substantive capital gains tax rollover relief, major reform on the industrial relations front, a bid to halve Commonwealth red tape on business inside its first term in office, new flexible arrangements and big cash incentives to take on apprentices, and sustaining rock bottom low interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fair trading law reform has become an increasingly important issue for local retail traders across the Hunter. The demand has come&mdash;following the string of inquiries of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11877"> former Labor government and the excellent expose provided by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance </EMPHASIS>report&mdash;from local retail traders that they want action now, not later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just the other day on local Hunter radio, Hunter Small Business Persons spokesman, Graham Henderson, put it all in perspective. He did not want the Senate or, more to the point, the Labor Party, Greens and Democrats to open up on this bill, to put through amendment after amendment or, more critically, to send it off to a committee with the only intention of stopping this legislation passing before the next election. I would also like to take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to Graham Henderson on being elected as the president of the Service Stations Association. He has been a tireless worker not just for service stations but also for small business in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears that the Hunter Small Business Persons group simply wanted the government to be able to meet their electoral commitment to address the issue of fair trading&mdash;and they want it addressed now. Clearly, what they do not want is to revisit the lack of action of the Labor government over the past 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After speaking last week and again today to Hunter Small Business Persons Hunter President, Peter Frost, he too expressed concern that the bill would not get through. However, in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald </EMPHASIS>apparently now the government and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) are `going to jelly over fair trading reforms' and `we need someone who will stand up for the multinationals'. The member for Newcastle's rent a quote for the article was a `weak at the knees' approach. I just do not cop that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 30 September this year the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business introduced the crux of the government's intentions towards genuine Commonwealth trading reform with the proposed insertion of a new section 51AC in part 4A of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The bill utilises the concept of unconscionable conduct and includes a set of criteria to assist the court in determining when unconscionable conduct is present in a commercial transaction. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provision is essentially confined to dealings involving small businesses, and listed public companies are excluded from this new proposed section 51AC. The provision is also limited to transactions which do not exceed $1 million, whilst an industry code will become vogue. Effectively, a breach in the industry code is a matter which may give rise to a finding of unconscionable conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further reforms in the fair trading package are codes of conduct to offer flexible and efficient mechanisms to address issues of business practice, with, amongst other things, a code of conduct enforcement unit to be set up in the ACCC; and a retail tenancies safety net, which is, despite the protestations of the Labor Party and Democrats, a solid, constitutionally upstanding Commonwealth measure to get the federal government to work with the states to achieve national reform of retail tenancy laws, including a stronger legislative safety net, along with support for additional minimum standards for retail tenancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further reforms include: franchising reform which encompasses a new mandatory franchising code of practice binding all franchisors; a new monitoring body&mdash;the Franchising Policy Council; the implementation of a dispute resolution adviser to assist franchise parties to avoid and resolve disputes between franchisors and franchisees more quickly and cheaply; and developing and fostering support amongst the banks to adopt better methods of risk assessment when lending for small business, along with better public education and information packages to assist small businesses. Small businesses want a fair go, a new deal on fair trading. Unquestionably, swift passage of this bill will improve their case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the member for Bendigo, Mr Reid, spoke on this bill earlier this week he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One thing about this inquiry was that small business did not ask the fair trading inquiry for protection. What they wanted was a fair go and a fair deal and what they have received from the government is a new deal and a fair deal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have to agree with that. The evidence is there for the need for these reforms to definitely shake up the foundations, despite the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11878"> protestations of sectors of the opposition or even the business lobbyists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the area of the new arrangements for service station operators. I will reflect in a moment on the shocking case of Ned and Pauline Cox, owners of the Caltex service station at Rutherford. I was informed this morning that petrol companies are pushing franchisees out of service stations before 1 July so that the new acts cannot take effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ned and Pauline have been at the Rutherford Caltex for over 20 years. Their franchise is renewed on the basis of a three-year lease option at $50,000 for the last franchise fee. You do not make a lot of money out of petrol stations. Indeed, they quoted that the average rate of return&mdash;a good rate of return&mdash;was 2.9c per litre. They have built up the business. The wages in that business have tripled in the last eight years. They would be one of the busiest sites in the Maitland area. They sell around 350,000 to 400,000 litres per month. They have been restricted by council in operating hours, from 4.30 in the morning to midnight, but still manage to achieve business success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 14 November, they received a letter from Australian Petroleum which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, your franchise agreement commencing on 1/9/95 (the `Agreement') expires on 31/8/98 . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are writing to advise you that Australian Petroleum Pty Ltd (`Ampol') will not be offering you a fresh franchise agreement subsequent to the Expiry Date which is the date when the total statutory nine year franchise entitlement . . . expires, or, in the case of head leased sites where we aren't renewing the head lease, which is the date of expiry of the head lease.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To show how committed they are to the people who have sold their product for over 20 years and have built the biggest business in Maitland in petrol sales, there was no personal visitation. This letter just turned up in the mail. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To facilitate the vacation of the premises, after final reconciliation of all amounts due or owing, Ampol will at the Expiry Date:&hyphen;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> buy back all underground petroleum products (purchased from Ampol) at the wholesale price on the Expiry Date; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> buy back all saleable Ampol lubricants at the wholesale price paid by you;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> try&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is the key word&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to put you in contact with a third party who may be interested in purchasing your merchantable shop stock (Ampol will not be purchasing any shop stock); and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> make a payment of the lesser of $5,000 or one months rent, to assist you in vacating the premises and closing the business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again we see the heartless action of big business&mdash;big business that was never brought to order by the former government, which ignored the situation. These pleas and cries have not occurred only in the last couple of months or the last 18 months since we have come to power; they have been there for years and years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government&mdash;in particular the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who likes to stand up and beat his hairy chest, which I suppose is dark these days, not grey, about support for small business in his government's term of office&mdash;did absolutely nothing. But I suppose they were going to do it next time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the `new deal, fair deal' policies, we hear squawks that the deal is not a tough deal. Prescribing the oil code under the Trade Practices Act means that complainants will have access to remedies and sanctions in the act along with a host of other measures. Something needed to be done. Something will be done. Sitting on the fence and watching the world go by by just producing another report without action is not the style of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again today it was put to me that major shopping centre managers are going through the shopping centres and driving the tenants into signing new lease agreements, making sure they have got everything stitched up before 1 July. Why? So there is no remedy under the new act, if and when it gets passed&mdash;with the assistance of the opposition. Why? Because the reforms will work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fair trading is but one part of the total plan for small business reform. It is an important issue but not the primary driving issue. In August, the Yellow Pages Small Business 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11879"> Index survey found that the economy, employment, general consumer confidence, taxation reform issues and industrial relations ranked well higher than red tape and bureaucratic measures which could be related to fair trading matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their 19 October survey, the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants' quarterly small business health index found most small businesses had not suffered at the hands of big business and that unfair conduct was not a major issue with small firms. They are not my words but theirs. That is logical because not all businesses are in big shopping centres. Within the Lower Hunter, 6,500 small businesses&mdash;only a minority of businesses&mdash;are in profile shopping centres. Most retail outlets are along street shop strips and the like. As one member of the Hunter Small Business Persons put it to me&mdash;and I think it puts it into perspective:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Going into a shopping centre, into a lease arrangement in a shopping precinct, is all about two things. Firstly, it's a business decision. Is the move, or staying in that centre, worth the investment? Secondly, businesses are a livelihood, they are not a location. You have the option to move that operation to a new location.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I said, those are his words, not mine. The issue at the end of the day is a commercial one. Minister Reith is correct to point out that the Labor Party's proposals, when it comes to the regulation of retail tenancies, of using the Corporations Law are unworkable unless small businesses and landlords incorporate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to independent legal advice from Dennis Rose QC of Blake Dawson Waldron for the Motor Trades Association, if lessors were not incorporated under part of Labor's so&hyphen;called fair deal on fair trading reform, then these small firms would be open to the Commonwealth imposing higher rates of income tax, let alone land tax from a state level. Small business would effectively be burdened with more red tape and there would be two sets of tenancy laws, one state and the other federal. It would mean two layers of industrial relations law. This is despite the fact that the government is determined to work with the states for an across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board, national approach to retail tenancies. As I said before, constitutionally the measures proposed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are the solid and practical way to go. At the end of the day, we do have to be practical. The success of a small business is all about getting more dollars through the cash register and keeping your input costs under control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look at this issue I only have to cast my mind back to 5 August and a public debate hosted by the Hunter Small Business People where the respective members of the inquiry addressed Hunter businesses on their desire for a fair go in relation to fair trading. I was there with my colleague the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), the member for Newcastle, the member for Cunningham, who is Labor's spokesman for small business, and the Democrats' business spokesperson, Senator Andrew Murray. You might call that a star&hyphen;studded cast, but there was plenty of pulpit thumping and hairy&hyphen;chest beating. All took up the fight for a better business deal. Sadly, as I pointed out then, a fair go for small business for Labor and the Democrats does not extend to relief from unfair dismissal provisions. Their fair go for small business did not include a balanced budget that drove down the interest rates. These are things that affect every small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, the next leader of the Democrats, the member for Newcastle and the member for Cunningham apparently want the fish and chip outlet, the clothes shop in a shopping centre and the fruito next door to a supermarket to get a fair go on fair trading but, it seems, nowhere else in the business community. Those fighting words do not carry through to providing valid relief from unfair dismissal provisions for these very same businesses, supporting them in actually employing people. I would not call that support for Hunter businesses. I would not call getting tangled up in more red tape, adding to the already imposing cost to a small business on average eight hours a week specifically for mandatory government and regulatory paperwork, delivering a fair deal for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> hasn't got the full story by overdramatising the situation, but we are used to that. We also have a new name for the member for Newcastle. We used to call him the Grim Reaper; we now call him

I want to say to the previous speaker also that if it is worth crossing the floor on chicken meat, why does he not cross the floor for the small business people of our region?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only reason the current Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) is in the position he is in is that the previous minister for small business steadfastly refused to seriously address the unanimous report of the committee that produced the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS> report on small business. That is why the current minister is there&mdash;not because the government gave priority but because the government steadfastly refused to seriously address the interests and needs of small business. It was only because of pressure from this opposition and from the multitude of small business people around Australia that, ultimately, the first minister for small business under the Howard government resigned and was replaced by the current minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current minister is much more astute politically&mdash;I do not want him to smile at me while I am saying this to him&mdash;and he recognised it is a large part of what they claim is their constituency. They had to show interest in this very serious report. It is an all&hyphen;party, unanimous report. There are not many reports that come forward on major issues like this. He realised that something had to be done or, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11881"> rather, that they had to be seen to be doing something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recognise the astuteness of the minister. He is well able to put together words that seem to convey one meaning but in practice achieve something different altogether. So, in this report, one of the key recommendations is about the uniform national tenancy code. Recommendation 2.2 of the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Minister request the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to approve the uniform retail tenancy code for underpinning the Trade Practices Act 1974 . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not accept for one moment&mdash;nor do small business people in this country&mdash;the government's alibi for not proceeding with that recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is a government that has always been in bed with big business&mdash;always. This government and its coalition predecessors have always been about the big end of town. The growth of change and the decimation of small retailers was a process that was steadfastly ignored by conservatives opposite. For the whole 23 years of government they had one consideration of small government. After many years they got their report and, when they got it, they made sure it never hit the tables of parliament. It was never reported; it was never tabled. Their interest was a perfunctory interest and, again, we see the same kind of thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening under this government again will see a handful of giant retailers controlling, through discriminatory pricing, the prices that consumers will pay. If you go to Charlestown in my electorate, you will find there a giant retailer which has a totally different set of prices from what that same chain in another part of my electorate has&mdash;depending on what the market will bear. That retailer determines what the consumer pays and what the producer pays. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, would understand that very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a handful of firms in this country deciding what the consumer pays and what the producer is paid. That is a very dangerous and unhealthy situation for this country. When you see who are on those firms, you will find they are the people who are appointed to do 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a task by this government. Have a look at the casino in Melbourne. It is not run by small business people. The government does not appoint small business people to any of the task forces or jobs it wants carried out. This government looks after the big end of town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have from this government is Clayton's support for shopping centre tenants. It pays lip service to small business. Chanting `small business' and `we're for small business' does not expand business; it does not provide net income for small business people. As I said, historically, Liberal&hyphen;National Party governments have been solid supporters of big business, and that is no more evident than in the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which stands ever ready to issue a press statement on the hour&mdash;almost on the minute&mdash;to back up whatever announcement the government has made. That is as it always was; it is not new. It expresses political views that masquerade as industry views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But small business problems are industry problems that demand industry solutions, not political rhetoric. The purpose of this Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997  to prohibit unconscionable conduct in relation to certain small business is really a case of small business versus big business. The report talks about the difficulty in defining `unconscionable conduct' and comes up with a special term&mdash;after full deliberation which the member for Paterson, an occasional attendee at that committee, put his name to&mdash;that it should be based on a definition of `fair trading'. That is the guts of this issue, and, again, is the triumph of big business&mdash;the Property Council of Australia, the giant retailers. Ask yourselves who influences this government. It is not the small business people, the retail tenants in Charlestown Square in my electorate or Lake Macquarie Fair or Belmont City Centre, who have all been exploited; it is the Property Council of Australia and the giant retailers of this country. But I will come to that a little later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation provides for the industry codes of practice to be prescribed and to be mandatory. Why not make them mandatory? Rather, why not adopt the recommendation of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11882"> the committee? The member for Paterson subscribed his name to a unanimous report from all of the members of that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who sit opposite ignored the plight of small retailers. It was not until pressure came from us and small business that they started to give some sort of consideration to it. But let me go to the plight of small business retailers in my electorate. I first raised this back in February 1996, before the last election, because I found over months beforehand that small business people in large retail centres are totally scared and intimidated. They come to you and talk to you and ask for help but ask that you do not mention their name. So I had to make statements that adverted to the problem without any reference to the firms, for fear of retribution from centre management. What I said to them in that statement of February 1996 was that anybody contemplating going into business in a large shopping centre must seek independent financial advice and get independent legal advice, otherwise they will be cannibalised. I see a succession of people in large shopping centres destroyed by the Property Council of Australia. The Property Council of Australia presents as a wonderful, almost do&hyphen;gooder, association, with glossy booklets and great statements and funds conferences and dinners all about business.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Don't even think about it. The first one I spoke to was Gerhardts Foods in Charlestown Square. They were summarily told at the end of their five&hyphen;year lease, `Out. We want your space in the food hall for McDonald's.' I can mention his name because he is now out of business. They got him out. He was pushed out and then the other food hall proprietors said, `Well, what about us? We build up the business, we make our investment in capital, we have built up the goodwill, and now you say to us that you want to take up a large section of the area to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bring in McDonald's!' A brawl went on about that for some time, and McDonald's have not made it yet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then I can talk about the supplier Fresh Fruit, a major business which built up a very good reputation for good quality fresh product. When the business got large enough, Coles went over to fresh foods and duplicated their business. He got moved and down went the level of business. He has now gone. We do not have Cut Price Deli there, but a number of other food establishments come in, make their investments&mdash;$&frac14; million&mdash;buy into a five&hyphen;year lease, build up goodwill, advertise and promote; and then they wake up one morning and they find that their business has been duplicated just a bit further down the concourse within the centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These small people pay extortionate rents compared with the rents the major retailers pay. They pay only nominal rent. The argument was that the nominal rent that was collected from the giant retailer was to enable them to be the drawcard. We all know very well that there has to be a range of products and services in shopping centres, and the small people in those shopping centres are as important as the giant retailers. I found through experience&mdash;going through shop after shop and having meeting after meeting with these people&mdash;that they were treated with arrogance and abuse. Women who were managing their businesses and made complaints to management got a stream of abuse&mdash;expletives. That was the arrogance of the management of that organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From abuse and arrogance came deceit: `Yes, there is a promotion levy. Yes, we'll have an input. Yes, we'll do that,' and nothing was done. Assurances were given that no other competitors would be brought in after they had built the business up, and those assurances were broken. Then the next thing that comes along is extended hours. They know full well that the smaller business people cannot work seven days a week, 14 hours a day. They have to sleep and have a rest and see their families some time. That was done to run down those small retail people. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11883">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I came upon a case in Belmont City Centre&mdash;again, I cannot reveal the name because the people are too afraid&mdash;where the tenant was nearing the end of their five&hyphen;year lease. There was no right of renewal, no compensation for goodwill and nothing could be sold&mdash;`Just take your gear and go'. That tenant was told, `Your rent is going up effectively 1,000 per cent.' The rent was going up; they had another tenant all lined up to come in. They drove out that tenant to bring in another tenant. They destroyed their business and destroyed their investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we find that not only is there this disgraceful conduct coming from organisations like that running Charlestown Square&mdash;and I mention that particularly&mdash;but also nothing has improved. Since this first came to me in 1995, the Property Council of Australia has had the ear of this government. The key issue, Minister, about which you smile, is a uniform tenancy code. That key issue has been swept aside by the government on the old fall&hyphen;back, `Look, it is really state law. We can't do anything about it. We'll have a look at it and see whether we can work out some sort of code of behaviour or something.' There is a multitude of law and services which involve federal and state and overlap, and the government's decision is to say to small business people in shopping centres, `Look, you aren't a sufficient priority.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those large shopping centres the people are virtually being crushed to death&mdash;their health collapses and they go out. The people who go in borrow or take their redundancy packages and their borrowings and lose the lot&mdash;lose their redundancy package, lose the business and lose the family home as well. That is why it is so important for anybody even just contemplating going into a large shopping centre to get independent financial and legal advice. Don't even think about going into a shopping centre because it is the constant supply of centre fodder that these managements use to say, `Well, we've got somebody else who wants your premises,' and as long as there are unwitting, innocent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people who do not know the dangers they are going into then the pressure can be kept up by the centre management to push out people they do not want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another side to this: the stock exchange. If you look at Lend Lease, you will see that Lend Lease prides itself upon being able to increase its profits year after year. It does that by extracting blood&mdash;literally blood&mdash;from small business people in large shopping centres. I have seen those people. I have seen the agony they go through, and I have seen the results of that. I have talked to centre managements and I have seen the arrogance and the dishonesty that comes from them. I say to Lend Lease and the Property Council of Australia: don't walk tall. The behaviour of members of your council and the behaviour of firms like Lend Lease is despicable and it is time that the public of this country knew a little more about the way you behave, the dishonesty, the lack of integrity and the sheer bloody&hyphen;minded exploitation of decent, honest Australians who believe you. There sit Lend Lease and GPT Property with all of their lawyers and accountants and along comes somebody out of the steelworks or maybe out of one of the other industries with a redundancy package and, bang, it all goes. They are foolish enough to believe them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is one more side to this. I ask the minister to take particular note of this. There are national franchise firms who target groups of people taking redundancy packages. They see them as the people who are flush with money. They have a large sum&mdash;maybe $200,000 or $250,000&mdash;and they need to do something. These poor unwitting people think that they can buy themselves a job, and they are targeted by these national franchisors.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I thank the many members who have spoken in the debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R311">Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill</XREF> . We have had a good debate in the national parliament on issues of national importance, and I thank all members for their interest. I encourage those members who have made a contribution and who have yet to do so to read the bill and to fully understand the various propositions which the government has advanced in this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation and the ensuing debate demonstrate that there has been a pent&hyphen;up demand, a real need here, for legislative action, to which the government has responded. It is correct, as the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) pointed out, that many members have had a direct involvement in these issues because small businesses have come to members in desperation, as the last point of reference, seeking a strong policy response from the national parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also acknowledge the strong endorsement of the government's package from government members and, in particular, the contribution of members who were members of the Reid committee, most of whom were able to make a contribution in this debate. I acknowledge that, even in the case of opposition members, there was an underlying recognition that the time had come for this reform and I think a quiet appreciation, even from members of the opposition, that the government had seized the moment and community sentiment in the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the contributions of members from urban, regional and rural electorates, indicative that the problems we are addressing come from all sectors of the small business community&mdash;rural, regional and urban. I also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> acknowledge the examples of problems encountered by many people in small business which have been referred to their local members who have stood in this place and given us and the parliament a better understanding of the practical problems that small business has faced. In fact, the Reid committee, which was a result of a promise the government had made prior to the last election and whose report was so influential in bringing forward the legislation&mdash;and we are today completing its second reading debate&mdash;went round Australia to give small business the platform and opportunity to be heard on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some misrepresentations and some misinterpretations of the government's statutory intentions both from the opposition and in some submissions or comments from larger organisations. So, as I sum up, I want to take the opportunity to expand upon the remarks I made in my second reading speech about our statutory intention, and then I want to take the opportunity to make some general remarks about some of the comments from the opposition and the key aspects of those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the introduction of this bill into the House on 30 September, the government has received a considerable number of submissions from industry and from advisers to industry on the policy underpinning this legislation and on matters of a technical or drafting nature. To those who have sought to reargue the merits of the policy decisions which the government has taken, I take this opportunity to indicate that we have no intention of altering the policy framework which gave rise to this bill, and which I outlined in my ministerial statement to the House on 30 September. As I said at that time, the government consulted widely and meaningfully over a four&hyphen;month period following the thorough work of the parliamentary committee and the tabling of its report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our reforms, as announced, have been widely supported across industry and almost unanimously within the small business community. They represent good public policy. They are overdue. They will be delivered. Those who may have been surprised at the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11885"> strength of the government's response ought not to have assumed that the coalition would do what the previous government did when it failed to act on 17 similar reports and reviews in its 13 years of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Submissions to this government which seek to reopen the policy balance of this bill, or which would have the effect of unravelling key elements of the multi-dimensional <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New deal: fair deal</EMPHASIS> package, will fall on deaf ears. I am, however, sensitive to submissions which relate to technical drafting or definitional matters and which would enhance our policy objectives or improve the implementation of these measures. Such submissions will be reviewed by the government in the period intervening between the debating of this measure in this House and its consideration in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also take this opportunity to clarify a number of matters relating to the statutory intent of the legislation. It is clear from submissions and from some public commentary that a number of misconceptions have already arisen. The primary purpose of this bill is not to drive large or small business into a more litigious environment, nor is it intended that the courts undermine the basic principles of contracts or trample on property rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does not force parties to enter into contractual relations against their will, nor does it compel any particular form of contract or style of contractual negotiations. Rather, as I said in both the ministerial statement and my second reading speech on 30 September, the primary purpose of the bill is to induce a behavioural change on the part of larger business towards smaller business and to provide to small businesses that are mistreated adequate means of redress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also repeat that the government would expect the vast majority of commercial transactions to not be challenged under either proposed section 51AC or 51AD. Challenges would arise only where commercial dealings breached the standards of behaviour set for industry sectors in codes or where the conduct was found to be unconscionable. Already it is apparent from submissions received that large businesses are taking advice on the potential 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> impact of these laws and reviewing business conduct and contracts to assess compliance. That is a good thing, particularly if it leads to the replacement of existing unconscionable conduct or the introduction of contracts with a higher standard of behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I encourage industry to review business conduct in this manner from this early stage of this bill's passage. Similarly, it is not consistent with the spirit of this measure for a party to commercial dealings to knowingly engage in business practices which would be unconscionable from the proposed date of operation, simply in reliance of the lack of existing legislative protection for business consumers against such conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prescription of industry codes and the prohibition on unconscionable conduct aim to provide a framework for commercial dealings that provides a greater degree of certainty for small business when entering into commercial transactions with big business. These initiatives are not intended to protect those who, through poor management, fail to succeed in business ventures, nor to compromise commercial risk taking and its consequences. The proposed section 51AC dealing with unconscionable conduct has already attracted much comment. This provision is, as the explanatory memorandum to this bill outlines, an extension of the equitable doctrine of unconscionable conduct. It is extended by the non-exclusive list of factors in subclauses (3)(a) to (k) to which a court may have regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some have argued that uncertainty exists with the retention of section 51AA in the principal act. This is not so. Section 51AA is retained as a remedy against unconscionability, albeit narrower in scope, for those aggrieved parties which do not fall within the definition of `business consumer' for the purposes of the new provision. That remedy currently exists and it would be perverse for the government, through this bill, to eliminate existing rights under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Others have argued that the scope of the proposed section 51AC is too broad because the list of enumerated factors is non-exhaustive. The government rejects that argument. Unconscionability involves such conduct as taking advantage of a weaker 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11886"> commercial party through undue influence, the pernicious exercise of bargaining power, trickery, deception, conduct against all conscience and economic duress. Conduct of this type cannot be quarantined to a limited set of facts. By its nature, those who engage in unconscionable conduct devise new ways and means of doing so. To limit the discretion of a court to the enumerated factors only would create a fertile ground for evasion of the statutory intent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such an approach would also compromise the intent to induce behavioural change. For example, it would be quite proper for a court, when considering a claim of unconscionability, to also consider the conduct of the business consumer, including the steps which the business consumer may or may not have reasonably taken to protect their own commercial interests. Evidence of such matters would almost certainly be admissible in proceedings, and it would be quite wrong to have a statutory bar to a court taking these relevant matters into consideration. As I said in the second reading speech on this bill, the adage of prevention being better than cure remains true&mdash;especially for small business with limited financial resources. This law is not intended to allow small business to avoid its responsibilities in commercial relations. Small business has not argued that this legislation should do so, and it does not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also been speculated that conduct which falls within just one of the enumerated categories in subsection (3)(a) to (k) automatically means that a case of unconscionability has been established. This is not so. The provision is intended to operate as a whole, with a court being given a discretion to have regard to these factors. Whether one factor alone establishes a case of unconscionability ought to depend on the gravity of the conduct complained of in a particular case. Indeed, what may be conduct giving rise to unconscionability between parties with greatly disparate bargaining power may not be unconscionable where the parties have an equivalence of bargaining power. This statutory scheme is no different to the approach adopted in section 51AB of the principal act dealing with consumer protection against uncon 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> scionable conduct. The policy balance in this bill is sound. Our statutory intent is clear. The legislation creates new rights and causes of action, but carries with it concomitant responsibilities for both large and small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now make some brief comments on the contributions of the opposition. I would start by saying that I am disappointed that the opposition have decided to play politics with this issue. It is hard to believe that, after they did so little for small business and did so much against its interests in the 13 years that they were in office, they should now seek to frustrate the government's intentions. The opposition amendments foreshadowed are born of political envy and political opportunism. The opposition spokesman spoke in terms which endorsed the government's response when I made the response on 30 September. But since then they have decided that they should play catch&hyphen;up politics to try to claw back some ground from their own discredited record. They got into a negative spin. If they think such clearly and transparently opportunistic moves will gather them any support in the small business community, I think they are mistaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) that ringing up representatives of small business and asking them, `What is it that's wrong with the package that the government has brought down?' as a means of gathering opposition to it does you no credit. You have been trying to manufacture opposition to it. In fact, in politics there is a simple lesson, and that is that many people will value oppositions that are, from time to time, prepared to be constructive when it is in the interests, in this case, of the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have seen virtually unanimous endorsement from small business of the government's package. Now that you know you are out in the cold, you are trying to do what you can to claw your way back. You are a reactionary voice, a lone voice, against what is a very good package. And, incredibly, you are on the public record as advocating amendments to this package which have been put to you&mdash;not by small business, but by certain big business  interests. You are on the public record as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11887"> saying that you are proposing to limit the benefits of this package for small business because you have been told by certain big businesses that it would be in the interests of small business for you to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say, it is a quite extraordinary proposition that the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) should accuse us of listening too closely to the interests of big business; and yet the shadow minister for small business and customs is on the public record as saying that he is proposing an amendment to limit the rights of small business because it has been put to him by big business. You are on the public record.</PARA>

Our job as the government in responding to it was to put together in a practical way a means of implementing that proposal. That is what we have done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have said, `You don't use "unconscionable" because it does not have case law.' Where do you people come from? Unconscionable does have jurisprudence. That is the reason for using it. What you do not understand is that the reason a lot of these propositions have been knocked off in the past and have never been able to be proceeded with was that, firstly, when you were in government you were not supportive of small business and, secondly, there was a legal argument against the proposal; namely, that it was uncertain in its meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we put together a package, I was absolutely intent on ensuring that we would have a full answer to that proposition. We have gone for a proposition which is based in the jurisprudence and which, therefore, is a fair response to the usual criticism of such measures; namely, that they are uncertain. When you say that there is no case law on unconscionability, you are just plain wrong. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) cited the criteria which the courts have established for the concept of special disadvantage, such as illiteracy and the like. On  this basis they argue that the word `uncon 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11888"> scionability' is too narrow. That is totally wrong and misleading. It is in total ignorance of the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition speakers, almost without exception, have missed the most basic point of this bill: the bill is an extension of the common law court determined concept of unconscionability. Section 51AA&mdash;Labor's failed amendment in 1992&mdash;is codification of the common law and has been of limited use only. That is why we are amending the law to go beyond 51AA, beyond what the courts have said. The opposition just has to read the explanatory memorandum to the bill. The top of page 23 makes this very clear. As many government members have pointed out, in proposed section 51AC we use much broader language, including references to unfair tactics. The word `unfair' is there, and it is there in the context of a more certain and reasonable proposition based on jurisprudence. That is why it is a good idea. That is why it has had so much support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite also propose that we change the definition of small business to the ABS definition and remove the $1 million threshold. Why? Because they have had discussions with some of the major corporations which have said that this would benefit small business. The shadow minister acknowledged that Lend Lease and Westfield think that use of the ABS definition is not such a bad idea. You continue to ask big business about what is good for small business. No wonder you did nothing for them for 13 years. You were asking the wrong people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, you say that we should have a national uniform retail tenancy code of conduct. You never argued for that when you were in government, and in the whole time that you have been in opposition you have been opposed to it. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has expressed his opposition to it on the public record, as has the former minister.

<PARA STYLE="Para">In light of the summing up by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith), in respect of the opposition's position regarding the fair trading inquiry report and the government's response, I think a number of issues need to be pointed out. First and foremost, he was absolutely correct when he said that the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and a number of other honourable members of this place worked long and hard to bring down a report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> , which made recommendations concerning the plight of small business. He is absolutely correct that that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In tabling that particular report the member for Bendigo said in part that the committee has `felt compelled to make strong recommendations to set some ground rules for what constitutes acceptable commercial conduct in Australia'. As the minister and others spoke 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in this debate they did just that: they clearly pointed out that the government's intention was to put in place a set of changes to the law which they believed would reflect what small business had said. That would have been fine, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and I am sure you have an intimate knowledge about this&mdash;save for the fact that the Reid committee made recommendations which are not reflected in the legislation before us today. That is why the Labor Party has moved these amendments which more faithfully reflect each and every one of those recommendations put forward by the Reid committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said in his response to the comments made in this place that the Reid committee report was only a statement of principle and that the government always would reserve the right to change that statement of principle. We had a series of very clear recommendations, whether in terms of retail tenancy, some form of assistance for small business as defined by the ABS or the other amendments on unfair or unconscionable conduct. As a consequence, we on this side of the place took to heart those recommendations in that committee's report. The Leader of the House and, I think, the member for Bendigo tried to portray in their comments that there is some division on this side&mdash;between the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), me and other members of the Labor Party&mdash;about whether or not we adopted this report and whether we stood for unconscionable or unfair conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me leave the House in no doubt: the shadow ministry, at a meeting in an outer Melbourne suburb earlier this year after the report by the honourable for Bendigo and his colleagues was tabled in this place, adopted unanimously, 100 per cent, that committee report as part of what Labor would try to implement and assist the government in doing.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is also important to understand that not only did the Labor Party come forward and support the Reid committee's recommendations when they were brought down but so, too, did many other people, including many small organisations that the minister referred to. For example, Mr Robert Gardini, who is well known to people because he has made submissions to many inquiries in respect of commercial operations and small business and was also involved with the Franchising Code Council before the former Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs starved it of its funds and it collapsed in a heap, said that he applauded the `recommendations of the fair trading inquiry which has delivered bipartisan political support'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sad thing about these amendments is that this is an excellent bill. We have done more for the small business community than has been proposed by anyone for the benefit of the small business community in 20 years. I do not say that&mdash;that has been said by small business organisation representatives across Australia from the moment we introduced our package. I remember hearing Marcus Kollington, from the Service Station Association, saying on the radio the next day words to the effect that small business can thank its lucky stars that the government has announced what it has. We had a very strong report from the Reid committee. We went around in a bona fide way looking at how we could implement the spirit of those recommendations. That is what we have done in a totally open, transparent and bona fide way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister, when we brought down the package, said it was a good package. He is quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as saying, `We said Peter Reith, the Minister for Small Business, has done well.' I thank him for that. That was a fair comment. Oppositions do not often give credit to governments. It has to be a pretty good package before they do. To do him justice, at the time he said it because he knew that it was important that we gather support for this package and get it through the parliament. Our intention is to move quickly on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made the statement mid&hyphen;afternoon and one of the best phone calls afterwards said, `When are you going to introduce the amendments to the Trade Practices Act to implement the policy you have just announced?' I was able to say, `I've got good news for you because I'll be back in parliament later this afternoon actually introducing the bill.' It is unheard of for the government to make a major policy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11892"> statement and, the same day, walk back into the parliament with the amendments to the legislation to make things happen. When you have waited 20 years for a decent policy it must be pretty refreshing and encouraging for the small business community that the government is so determined to make this happen that we should actually walk in with it on that day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a government we are unashamedly pro&hyphen;small business. We think the small business community in this country is fantastic. We think they have tremendous potential and it is very important for the small business community that they appreciate that this government is on their side. You could say that this is a political pitch, but the question of confidence in the small business community is very important in itself. If people feel confident that the government is on their side, then they are going to be confident about the future and it will have practical benefits for people running small businesses. They will give somebody a job and really make things happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad thing is that the Labor Party, knowing that this is a good package for small business and having said it publicly, is now basically nit&hyphen;picking and trying to do all it can to prevent these reforms going through. As I have demonstrated, you can show where they are factually wrong. They are plainly absolutely wrong and ignorant of the facts and have the hide to come in here and say, `We are proposing this amendment because big business has told us it is a good amendment.' I have never heard such a proposition. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The simple fact is that the Labor Party adopted the Reid committee report in full as a result of the committee doing a tremendous job and bringing down a report which said that there should be changes to legislation dealing with small business and picking up the issue of unfair trading. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) at the meeting that the minister referred to earlier on 17 December 1997 at the Camberwell centre in Melbourne said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also state clearly on behalf of Labor that we support all the recommendations of the fair trading report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I was saying earlier, that support came from other areas. It came from Mr Robert Gardini, someone who has been intimately involved with issues like this for quite a period of time. When the Reid committee report came down, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia also called for a full implementation of the report&mdash;not this adoption of principles that the minister talks about, but the full adoption of the report. That is the report that the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) chaired and voted down just a moment ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, Mr Michael Delaney of the MTAA said that he expected the government to adopt the report in its entirety. Does that sound like it is a statement of principles that they would like to have adopted? Not to me, not to the Labor Party; it was that these people, who represented small business interests and had given evidence to Mr Reid, wanted the member for Bendigo and his committee to go about that task and mean what they said. If they brought in a report that said, `We want to see unfair changes made to unconscionable conduct'&mdash;that is, `unfair' instead of `unconscionable'&mdash;that is what would happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we find the member for Bendigo leading the charge by his own side to say, `Hang on, forget what we said in the report. Mr Reith's come along as the minister and said that we can't wear that. We're going to have unconscionable conduct, and if he says that's what we have to do, like good backbenchers we're not going to kick on this particular occasion. We will not have unfair trading. We will not adhere to what the report said.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did you waste your time? I ask the member for Bendigo: why did you spend 12 months of your time getting all the wraps around Australia talking to the cherished constituency of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), that is, small business, listening to all their complaints, coming into this place and bringing down a report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS>? Then you turn around and when the minister 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11893"> puts up legislation that walks away from your recommendations, you say, `Okay minister, we got it wrong, after 12 months.' It is only a statement of principles.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It did not stop with that sort of praise for what the member for Bendigo had done in calling for the adoption of this report in its entirety. We had the Australian Retailers Association say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The association is concerned that if the whole of the committee's recommendations, in particular a shotgun approach of attempting to cover all corporation and small business relationships by general amendment of section 51AA of the TPA consider the key issues of demonstratable concern then those which occupy the vast majority of the committee's report, that is, tenancy and franchising are likely to be lost.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quick and focused attention on retail tenancy will have an immediate effect and will earn the gratitude of thousands of specialty and small retailers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As we will come to a little later this afternoon, they walked away from retail tenancy as well, saying it is not constitutionally possible to do it. But the member for Bendigo said it was. The member for Bendigo and the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), copycat over there, and the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), up the back, all came to an agreement in this report saying, `Yes, you can actually have federal laws in respect of retail tenancy.' But now that is only a statement of principle. That report is going to be consigned to the dustbin of history. It does not mean a thing because it is a statement of principle. The minister just came here a minute ago and told us when he said, `It's a statement of principle and the government has chosen not to deal with it.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is clearly the case that all of the indicators are increasingly showing that the government's economic strategy, pursued since March of last year, is absolutely correct. Some data on the national accounts came out today. I would not be surprised if the Treasurer had something to say about that data later today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I take the opportunity of reminding the House of the state of the Australian economy in a number of important respects when we came to power&mdash;the fact that we inherited a $10.5 billion deficit, and we will have eliminated that deficit in just three years; that we inherited interest rates that were something like 2&half; to three per cent higher than what they are now, and we have delivered cuts in housing interest rates that are worth between $200 and $260 a month to the average mortgagor in Australia; that we inherited an economy that had very high levels of indebtedness of national debt, and we have worked to reduce that national debt; that we inherited an archaic industrial relations system, and we have made significant improvements to that industrial relations system. We have embarked upon the most imaginative and successful privatisation program in Australia's economic history. The very successful float of Telstra was far beyond the expectations of even the most optimistic on the government side and it was achieved in the teeth of virulent opposition from both the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the opportunity of remarking for a moment on the alternative economic strategy that is on offer. The alternative economic strategy is really a retreat by the Labor Party back to a policy of high intervention in the economic affairs of Australia. Given what has happened in a number of the economies in our region in recent weeks, I find it very surprising that any party that seeks to be the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government of this country would move towards policies which have so demonstrably failed in other parts of the world. One of the take&hyphen;outs that one can have from what has occurred in our region is that high interventionist economic strategies do not work. Yet increasingly the Labor Party is moving towards the embrace of high economic strategy as policy by policy, issue by issue the Labor Party abandons any pretence that it once had to embracing policies that placed any kind of serious reliance on the operation of the open market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As time goes by, I think it will increasingly be seen to be the case that the Labor Party are retreating to old&hyphen;fashioned, 1950s economic policy. They are turning their eyes against the idea of embracing any kind of optimism about the future of this country. They are the party that is against taxation reform; they are the party that is against industrial relations reform; they are the party which, given an opportunity, would burden this country once again with a high budget deficit; they are the party that is against privatisation; they are the party that is against imaginative, micro&hyphen;economic reform. So I would say to the honourable member for Kooyong that the government's economic policies have been highly successful. The alternatives on offer would take Australia backwards and not forward because the Australian Labor Party have no economic vision at all for the 21st century.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are we wiping out native title across mainland Australia? We are not. We are providing a fair and due process which will allow the determination of these matters and will allow compensation, but, in the meantime, will allow the Ernest Henrys and every other new mine to go ahead&mdash;giving a little bit of excitement to the export effort of rural and regional Australia and jobs to Aboriginal people, including the 100 Aboriginal people who are involved in the construction of the Ernest Henry mine, and giving them a bit of hope. That is why we need our amendments, and we need them to come through the Senate sooner rather than later. The matter is not over by any stretch of the imagination until you get to the conclusion of the Senate deliberations, either first time around or, for that matter, second time around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an additional point. This is not just a matter relating to the security of one particular mine. For example, there are 500 Queensland mining leases which could be in jeopardy if the injunction to stop Ernest Henry is successful. The Queensland Mines Department has figures for 522 similar leases which have been issued between January 1994 and December 1996. One of them is the very important Duchess phosphate project just south of Cloncurry, which has a lot of jobs attaching. It involves the connection of a gas pipeline, and sulfuric acid from Mount Isa. It is a very strategic development which will lead to import replacement and create even more jobs in Far North Queensland.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Today's national accounts for the September quarter show that the Australian economy grew in the quarter by 1.5 per cent. That is one of the strongest quarterly growths we have had for several years and would put Australia as possibly the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> highest growing economy in the developed world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Plainly, the government's budget forecast of 3&frac34; per cent growth is right on track. The outcome of 1.5 per cent, particularly taken with a revision to the June quarter of 1.4 per cent, puts growth over the last two quarters alone at around 2.9 per cent. The Australian economy is now a low inflation, high growth economy. We now have an inflation rate which is the lowest we have seen in Australia since the 1960s. Standard variable mortgage rates in Australia are the lowest since 1969, having come down nearly four per cent since this government was elected. We now have a budget which, from a position of over $10,000 million in deficit when the Labor Party left office, could well be in surplus next year&mdash;after one term of coalition government. We also have a program to retire debt which, on current estimations, will take Labor's build&hyphen;up of debt of nearly $100 billion and halve the debt to GDP ratio by the turn of the century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us make no mistake about it: this government believes that Australia has the potential to be a strong growth economy and we want to see it be a strong growth economy. We also know that, in relation to getting up growth and sustaining it, it is important to undertake the structural changes that will give us the opportunity to continue growth into the future. Those structural changes included lowering Australia's inflation rate. When we set out to do that by a new agreement with the Reserve Bank of Australia, notwithstanding the opposition of the Australian Labor Party, we were able to put in place a strong, low inflation framework between the government and the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of our inflation strategy was also to fix up the Australian budget, to take it from being in deficit and to put it into surplus. In addition to that, this government is intent on addressing Australia's perennial problem over the last couple of decades, our current account deficit; our current account deficit which is mainly fuelled by the build&hyphen;up of foreign debt and our current account deficit which must be attacked by building government savings. Building government savings is part of this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11897"> government's proposal. In this year the Australian government will borrow not one dollar. This year we will be repaying Keating Labor debt, next year we will repay Keating Labor debt and the year after we will repay Keating Labor debt. We cannot undo all the damage of 13 Keating Labor years in one term, but what we can do is make a start, and this government is making a start in relation to this.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, young people and communities in my electorate have welcomed the government's work for the dole initiative. What has been the wider response to the work for the dole initiative and how will this initiative benefit Australian communities?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="11898" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to inform the House that today the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs launched the work for the dole initiative at the Bankstown Aviation Museum. I think it is very appropriate that it was released in Bankstown, because it is in electorates like Blaxland that there is the strongest support in Australia for projects like work for the dole. The reason why the Labor Party did such a definite back&hyphen;flip on work for the dole is that they realise that work for the dole makes a lot of sense to working Australians. Work for the dole implements the government's commitment to the principle of mutual obligation, a principle that says that you ought to provide a social security safety net but in return it is reasonable to ask people to make some contribution back to society. That is a principle that we have unflinchingly advocated. It is a principle that not only underlies our approach to work for the dole but also underlies our approach to other policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In announcing the program today, the minister announced 22 projects, comprising some 314 participants. Of the 314 partici 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pants, 192 are volunteers and 122, in accordance with the amended legislation which was ultimately let through by the Australian Labor Party, have been compulsorily referred. There will in total be 179 pilot programs, with 10,000 participants in total. I am told that up to 40 projects could be under way by Christmas time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very important initiative. It fulfils a commitment I made on behalf of the government earlier this year. It has been marked in its introduction by a monumental backflip by the Labor Party when they realised that the Australian public actually supported the idea. They originally came out and said they would oppose it, and then, when they realised that the mail was running in the opposite direction, they did a monumental backflip, just as they have done monumental backflips on so many other elements of policy when they have thought the mail is running against the original position that they have taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to congratulate the minister for his stewardship of this particular program. I imagine that he will have more to say about it today and in the days and the weeks ahead, because work for the dole is a very desirable approach to the problem of unemployment. Work for the dole is fulfilling the principle of mutual obligation. Work for the dole will deliver to many young people a greater sense of self&hyphen;worth. It will put them on the pathway to greater employment opportunities, and I think it is an approach which has very wide community support, particularly in areas like the western suburbs of Sydney.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11900">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very impressed with the enthusiasm of the young people I spoke to on this project. Members of the House may be interested that I had the opportunity to speak to a number of young participants who were referred by Centrelink to the project. It is a misconception that I think is very widespread on the other side of the House that young people who are referred are somehow or other unwilling participants. What I found was that these young people had welcomed the approach from Centrelink.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many cases they had lost the self&hyphen;confidence that would have induced them to put themselves forward but, given the opportunity, they were delighted to be able to work on this project. They saw it as something very positive in their lives and they believed that this project would help secure them the job they were looking for in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were also present this morning a number of young people from St George, who will be working on a project to interview elderly migrants about their experiences in Australia, as part of an oral history. They will be taking this project right through to the publication of a book on the experiences of these migrants. In the course of it, they will be learning vital interviewing and communication techniques which so many employers are looking for when they seek a young person to fill a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other projects that are currently getting under way include: beautifying Goode Beach in Western Australia, improving facilities for elderly disabled people in Brisbane, helping to run a community radio station in Tasmania and working to improve Victoria's famous Puffing Billy railway tourist attraction, which I understand is largely within the member for La Trobe's electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle of work for the dole, as the Prime Minister said, is mutual obligation. The community believes that, when so many breadwinners in families and others are working hard to provide support for unemployed people, it is fair that unemployed people put something back into the community. There will be some 314 young people participating in these 22 projects. In the course of seeking participants, Centrelink has, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I regret to say, already breached some 17 young people out of the vast number willing to take part. These were young people who did not want to put back into their community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us make no mistake that this is a fundamental point of difference between the Labor Party and the coalition. We believe that this principle of mutual obligation is fair. It is appropriate that young people put something back into their community and, where they refuse to do so or choose not to do so, they will have their dole reduced. That will be a consequence. I hope that there will not be many young people in this category. Those who have been breached will have their dole reduced by 18 per cent for 26 weeks. I urge these young people, and other young people who are volunteering, thinking of volunteering or may be approached by Centrelink to take part in work for the dole projects, to realise the wonderful opportunity that these projects are offering them to contribute something to their community, to be part of Australian history and to build work experience that will look very good when they approach an employer and that will certainly help them get a job at a future time.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Over the last two days in Kuala Lumpur, there has been a meeting of the ASEAN finance ministers and ASEAN plus six finance ministers. The ASEAN plus six finance ministers include Hong Kong, China, the United States, Japan, Korea and Australia. I was pleased to be present during the discussions, which naturally focused on currency instability in the region, the reform of financial institutions and economic prospects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">IMF programs are already in place in relation to Indonesia and Thailand, and an emergency funding facility is also in place in relation to the Philippines. Korea is now engaged in active negotiations with the International Monetary Fund concerning its own problems, and it is expected that an agreement will be arrived at between the International Monetary Fund and Korea as early as today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has contributed to those packages for both Thailand and Indonesia&mdash;in Indonesia, as part of a second tier of financing to be drawn down in the event that the IMF and multilateral institutions provision does not prove to be sufficient, although the managing director of the IMF stated in Kuala Lumpur that the object would be to ensure that the second tier is not drawn down and that the first tier of financing is sufficient to see Indonesia through those restructuring difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Plainly, there are now severe problems in Korea. A number of merchant banks have been closed in the last 24 hours. It is clear that there are severe problems in the Korean 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> financial system and it will be necessary, as part of an IMF program, to rationalise those financial institutions, secure those that can be secured and deal with those that have difficult problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has had a request for assistance in relation to Korea but, as I have made clear to the House before, the policy of the Australian government is that the IMF should announce the package; the package should be seen as a temporary facility to allow restructuring of an economy so that the restructuring secures the economy in the long term; Australia's involvement would be at the behest of the IMF and would be determined on the basis of regional and national interests from Australia's point of view; and Australia's involvement would be only by way of a loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in Australia's interests for strong growth to return to the Asian region. A downturn in the fast&hyphen;growing Asian region will have an effect on Australia. It will affect our exports, and a downturn in Korea will affect Australian exports more than will the ASEAN four which have already experienced the full brunt of financial instability. Just as a downturn in Asia will affect Australia adversely, so too an upturn has benefits for Australia. This is the important point: an upturn and a return to growth in Asia is in Australia's interests.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very welcome decision by the commission, headed up by the new president, Mr Justice Giudice. They made a very clear finding in regard to this application. The effort by the CFMEU to seek an interim award whilst proceedings in respect of an arbitration under section 170MX were afoot was thrown out on the merits, and that is without the jurisdictional argument being addressed. It is a welcome decision because it clears the way for a more sensible agreement which can lead to better work practices and, therefore, better efficiencies. It is also welcome because the AMWU was involved in these proceedings&mdash;and I think the honourable member was a former vice&hyphen;president at a branch level of the AMWU. What we saw from the AMWU was a break out in commonsense&mdash;and he has got his ticket there. I compliment the member. We have real union members on our side; not the phoney union elites that they have on the other side.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11903">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than having an ideological battle, the AMWU in this particular instance actually wants an agreement that will look after its members&mdash;a shock to the ex-ACTU presidents sitting on the other side who have only ever been interested in looking after themselves. The reform process in the coal industry is a long and hard one, but it is very important for the future of this country. We welcome the excellent decision from the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Longman. I can also advise the member for Longman that the government is aware that veterans do prefer less bureaucracy when receiving their payments. This government is firmly committed to that goal. It is not only that veterans deserve less bureaucracy and a streamlined approach to the receipt of their entitlements, but also the debt that this nation owes to our veteran community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am well aware of the fact that veterans prefer to do their dealings through the Department of Veterans Affairs. The department is solely focused on the needs and the welfare of our veteran community. Currently thousands of veterans receive a disability pension through my department, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and an age pension through Centrelink. The Liberal and National Party government have taken the view that two payments through two departments amount to duplication for veterans, which is simply not necessary. Veterans now will have the choice of receiving both entitlements as one payment through one department&mdash;the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is a commonsense approach of this government. We are already seeing the veterans of our community supporting this approach. Already, 9,700 veterans have elected to have their Centrelink payment made through the Department of Veterans Affairs as part of their entitlement with their disability pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new system comes into being in March of next year. Unfortunately for our veteran community, that would have been possible in July of this year had it not been for the obstructionist approach the opposition took in the upper house when it joined with the Democrats in putting forward an unrelated amendment to the bill. The bill as it stood would have facilitated this approach much sooner than March of next year. Quite clearly, the opposition did not have the interests of the veteran community at heart when it took that approach in the upper house. This government is about delivering a streamlined service to our veteran community. We all owe a great debt of gratitude to our veteran community. We are making it happen.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also under that category of roads of national importance with the Pacific Highway is the Summerland Way and the Kidman Way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as importantly as far as transport reform is concerned, unlike the previous government, we have addressed the issues surrounding the Sydney airport. As I outlined in an answer yesterday, this government went to the last election with a couple of key commitments with regard to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The first one was that we were going to re-open the east-west runway. We have done that. The east-west runway has been re-opened. We are also committed to redistributing aircraft noise. As of tomorrow we will see 55 per cent of movements over water, 17 to the north, 15 per cent to the west, and 13 per cent to the east&mdash;a great reform as far as that very important element of transport infrastructure is concerned in Sydney, New South Wales&mdash;and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11906"> Australia, because that airport is worth $8 billion per annum to the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the previous government&mdash;the Labor government&mdash;we are committed to a thorough, objective and transparent parent EIS process for the development of the second Sydney airport. We are pursuing that. Along with the 1995 Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney for the first time ever an independent auditor has been appointed to provide independent reports on the EIS and to provide the community with another source of information to allow them to respond to the issues raised in the draft EIS. This government is making transport reforms in a very positive way. It is doing that in consultation with the community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, this is about reform of the Australian waterfront, which is part of our transport system, and a scam that is being undertaken on the waterfront that is getting under way today, which is directly relevant to Australia's transport system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Wells advertises services that indicate that he and his company can maintain up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date training and contact regarding overseas methods employed by kidnappers and terrorists, first&hyphen;class weapons handling of numerous types, use of concealed batons and unarmed combat techniques.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Kilfoyle, who is a recently discharged bankrupt and former ex-SAS commando, has skills advertised on his behalf, including electronic surveillance, private investigation, training in small arms, close quarters personal control, including unarmed combat techniques, restraints, holds and blocks, use of a baton, use of handcuffs and various methods of searching offenders. This is reminiscent of the `New Guard' and the `White Army' in the 1920s and 1930s in Australia. This is reminiscent of the Sandline mercenaries in Bougainville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are these the skills that are needed to improve the productivity on Australia's waterfront? Is this the government's approach to industrial relations&mdash;bring in the heavies, bring in the spies and bring in the military types to boot the crap out of all the people on the waterfront? Is this how they will sort out the wharfies&mdash;electronic surveillance and people who are obviously trained in violence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question that this government has to answer is: who is behind Peter Kilfoyle and Michael Wells? Where are the millions of dollars necessary to fly people to Dubai and to pay them salaries for three years coming from? What government involvement is there? Is there any government money in this? Is there any money being laundered through other parties&mdash;for example, consultants? Is the Defence Department or the military involved and, if so, in what way? Are any serving officers involved? Why was this advertise

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What deals or arrangements have been made with the government of the United Arab Emirates, which, it is worth pointing out, owns the port of Dubai. The ruling family of the United Arab Emirates happens to own the company that supplies the labour. So it would be very surprising if there has been no connection at all between the government of the United Arab Emirates and the Australian government on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What private companies have been involved and what commitments have been made to those companies and who drafted a very thorough and very professionally presented Australian workplace agreement&mdash;all from a $20 company with two ex-military people not of obviously substantial means? If the government, as it has said today, denies any role in all of this, why is the advertisement published in an official army newspaper and how likely is it that private companies are going to invest millions of dollars in an escapade of this nature with no indication from the government of support or willingness to facilitate the entry of this industrial mercenary labour force onto the docks?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How likely is it that the United Arab Emirates government is going to agree to this sort of approach and to this sort of escapade in its own backyard without discussing the matter with representatives of the Australian government?

You have a situation where the government is providing millions of dollars and refusing to say where that money is being spent, on what sorts of activities, in spite of the Senate passing a return to order motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) is all the time unctuously saying, `I am consulting. I am being frank with the Maritime Union. I am being reasonable. We will have another meeting.' He has met twice with them. He said that he is just being frank and constructive. He says he has no knowledge of the escapade that is under way today, yet it was advertised in the army newspaper twice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial productivity on the waterfront is improving&mdash;something that the government refuses to acknowledge. It needs to improve a bit more, but it is improving. It has gone up substantially in the last quarter. We have had a massive misinformation campaign from this government about productivity on the waterfront. We have had outrageous statements&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">outrageous lies&mdash;about the level of pay of many waterside workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had implications, including a press release from the former minister saying that a teenage prank of blowing up the letterbox of his former adviser on maritime affairs was in some way the work of the Maritime Union. The Prime Minister has stood in here saying that perishables have been left rotting on the waterfront by the MUA. When he is asked&mdash;twice&mdash;in questions on notice to give examples, he refuses to. John Sharp is parading around the country talking about the nick&mdash;John Sharp, the expert on the nick; the man who invented the nick. Today we have the exposure of an outrageous scam, an outrageous escapade. It is gradually coming to light. This government has to answer a variety of questions about what is going on in waterfront reform in this country. If, as the government claims, it does not know&mdash;in spite of the whole thing being advertised in one of the army's own publications&mdash;why on earth does it not know about what is going on under its nose?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is about industrial mercenaries. It is about as outrageous and improper as it can get. This is Australia's Sandline. It is deceit and duplicity on a grand scale. You have people connected with the defence forces&mdash;ex&hyphen;SAS people, ex&hyphen;commandos&mdash;being used to attack workers on the waterfront. They are workers who have committed no offence; workers who are complying with the industrial relations laws of this country; workers who are not even on strike; workers who are just doing their daily work. But people are being sent across Dubai to be trained to take their places and to get in there and help get rid of them. This parliament needs to know what role the government or any of the government ministers, staff of the government ministers or people in the departments administered by those ministers have in this entire outrageous escapade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a brutal assault on the perceived enemies of this government&mdash;the waterside workers. It is a bad game, a dangerous game, involving people in the military and people in the defence department. It is a clear attempt to provoke not just war on the waterfront but 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11911"> outright nuclear war on the waterfront. The government should immediately take stock of what is going on in its waterfront reform program and what it is actually doing. It should find out precisely what it does not know&mdash;if we can take the minister at face value today. It should repudiate these mercenaries&mdash;the Prime Minister had the opportunity to do that and he refused to do it&mdash;and it should withdraw any support that is going to this project. It should provide all details to this parliament of its involvement in this outrageous scheme, and it should convene an independent inquiry to determine precisely what sort of involvement it and any of its officers, its ministers or staffers in the offices of those ministers have in this whole business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The episode is a deeply embarrassing scandal for this government. It is reminiscent of the sorts of things that go on in military dictatorships. If people are being taken out of the military and leaving the country in response to an advertisement in the army's official newspaper so they can be trained to be deployed as strike breakers, as job stealers and as people on the waterfront who are going to get rid of the Maritime Union of Australia, then we have on our hands a very serious situation indeed. It is something that this government has to be called to account for.</PARA>

It is important that we take the opportunity today to put the government's record on transport reform on the record. It goes right across all transport sectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the shadow minister has made a speech in recent times about intermodal interfaces. He concentrated 15 minutes on one mode of transport in the MPI this afternoon and ignored some of the most important problem areas of transport in Australia that this government has attacked. They are in the areas of rail reform, aviation and airport sales&mdash;as far as the national transport planning task force is concerned, when the former minister tabled that report, in the dying days of the previous Labor government, he buried the recommendations within it&mdash;not to mention the reforms that this government has undertaken in the last 18 months on roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems we started this debate on waterfront reform. Let us just have a look at a couple of the critical issues that hang around the neck of the Labor Party like an albatross 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11912"> as far as waterfront reform is concerned. Under its failed waterfront industry reform program, the WIRA program, the Labor Party was prepared to see over $400 million spent basically to pay out wharfies who were no longer needed to do the work on the Australian waterfront. It was a frank acknowledgment that the waterfront was grossly overmanned and that the community needed and deserved a more efficient stevedoring industry. Earlier this year, the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne, acknowledged the failure of the WIRA program, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately the process of reform stalled for some time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was at a cost of $400 million to the taxpayer. A lot of those wharfies who were paid out came back in through the side door, working as casual operators on the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other exercise that was of great embarrassment to the Labor Party was their failed attempt to sell ANL. When the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) was the minister, he said you could not give it away. The then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, said, `Look, Laurie, you had better get the cleaners in to fix this problem up at ANL.' He took him seriously and he did get the cleaners in. He brought in Malcolm Turnbull and Neville Wran and paid them nearly a million dollars, but that failed as well. It has taken this government to get ANL up to a point where it is in a saleable form. This government, as one of its substantial transport reforms, will go ahead and sell ANL in a profitable manner, not give it away and not waste any more money on ANL the way the Labor Party did. Neither will it waste any more money on the waterfront the way the Labor Party did when they were in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to outline, in my response to the shadow minister for transport, a number of the very positive reforms that this government has undertaken and implemented in its first term in a little over 18 months. The Labor Party did not even attempt to tackle a lot of these issues over 14 years but, in the scant comments in their platform, they now say they are going to do it. They were going 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to do it in the 14th year. They had 13 years to do it but they just did not quite get it done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will start with rail reform. The record of the opposition was one of total failure as far as rail was concerned. In 13 years in government and after 18 months in opposition, their draft platform for rail reform is an embarrassment. They have promised to do things that this government is already doing and they have promised to do things they either opposed or failed to do in 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During their 13 years in government, we saw the Labor Party absolutely gut Australian National. They cost 7,000 rail jobs through their neglect and incompetence, and that was confirmed in a speech that Senator Schacht made in the Senate recently. They gutted AN, they lost 7,000 rail jobs and, in their last seven years, 16 rail lines in South Australia were closed. They closed the Adelaide to Victor Harbor line, they closed the Adelaide to Peterborough line, they closed the Adelaide to Broken Hill line, they closed the Adelaide to Whyalla line and they closed the Adelaide to Mount Gambier line. That was their policy of transport reform&mdash;to close it down. They gutted AN to try to prop up National Rail and all they did was cost 7,000 rail jobs. The Australian taxpayer subsidised AN by $750 million in the last five years of Labor alone, and this government has had to spend $2 billion to fix Labor's neglect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of AN to the private sector has resulted in three new rail operators in Australia with local and international experience. Transrail, the private rail operator in New Zealand, was 50 per cent more efficient than AN in only two years of private sector operation. It is now carrying 15 per cent more freight and is expanding into new markets and into new services. The new rail owners in South Australia and Tasmania are contractually committed to investing nearly $100 million in rail over the next four to five years. Some have already announced plans to invest more and already old rail lines closed under Labor are being reopened or examined for reopening. That is positive transport reform, not the negative stuff that we have seen in their platform, not the negative stuff we saw from Labor over 13 years and not the negative 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11913"> rubbish we heard in the shadow minister's address here this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as national rail is concerned, Labor's bungled efforts to reform interstate rail simply resulted in the death of AN and the loss of 7,000 jobs in South Australia&mdash;all under the tutelage of the Labor Party. That is absolutely outrageous. There is no doubt that a lot of people who would normally support the Labor Party in the union movement have supported the rail reform program undertaken by the government as well as the privatisation of AN, which has seen the maintenance of rail operations in South Australia and in Tasmania. In addition, many hundreds of jobs have been maintained. The Labor Party would have seen the loss of not only those 7,000 jobs but also the loss of the rest of the jobs that were associated with AN. This privatisation has breathed new life into those rail operations. In Tasmania they are going to expand, with a commitment to investment and a commitment to creating more jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another very important area of transport reform, I want to mention some of the changes that have been made at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. I have alluded to them in a couple of questions this week, which is an important week as far as the operations at KSA are concerned. This airport injects $8 billion into the local economy. It is a very important piece of transport infrastructure that, again, was neglected under Labor. We have recognised the importance of the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport not only to Sydney but also to the broader community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On being elected last year, we committed this government to reopening the east&hyphen;west runway. That was done in a very short time and, as I said yesterday, in `sharp' fashion by the member for Hume (Mr Sharp). We also committed to equitably distribute airport noise. The long&hyphen;term operating plan that has been developed in conjunction with the Sydney Airport Forum, chaired by the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), is going to be implemented tomorrow. It will see 55 per cent of movements over water and 17 per cent of movements to the north over the suburb of Sydenham, which is represented by the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> well as over the suburbs represented by the Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). Ten per cent of those movements will be inbound aircraft landings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former minister for transport, when he reformed the flight paths around Sydney, ended up with one per cent of movements over his electorate. The member for Bennelong is going to have 17 per cent, and there will be 13 per cent to the east and 15 per cent to the west. That is equity and that is about maintaining that most important piece of transport infrastructure in Sydney&mdash;the Kingsford Smith airport&mdash;which generates $8 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have expanded the operations and activities of airlines into Sydney. We are opening up capacity into Australia. Each extra jumbo jet that we allow to travel into Australia is worth in excess of $22 million a year to the local economy and 640 jobs. That is transport reform, not the nonsense that the opposition was going on with in this debate on the MPI this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is absolutely committed to transport reform. It is committed to transport reform that is going to deliver jobs to Australians. It is committed to transport reform that is going to deliver a better bottom line to the Australian economy. We heard today from the Treasurer (Mr Costello) that in the last quarter the GDP increased 1.5 per cent and that we were on target with our budget estimates. That is what the reforms that this government is implementing are going to achieve. That is what they are going to deliver to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as airport reform and transport reform in regard to aviation is concerned, we have moved on from where the Labor Party stalled over the sale of airports. We have gone on with the sale of long&hyphen;term leases for Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports, receiving almost $3.5 billion for them. The most the former government had expected from the sale of the 22 airports&mdash;not just those three&mdash;was $2 billion. We have got the other 15 airports to go&mdash;they are in the process of that privatisation at the moment. So the coalition government is achieving in transport reform, particularly in the aviation sector. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11914">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to the area of road transport, which is absolutely vital to the transport economy of Australia. There are somewhere in the vicinity of 17,000 road transport operators in Australia who generate $60 billion worth of economic activity. These are the people whom the member for Melbourne completely ignored in his address during the MPI debate this afternoon. He spoke about a trip to Dubai, allegedly by a group of people for some form of training, but he completely ignored the people employed in the transport sector who are doing the job in Australia to bolster our economy; and we need to get on the record this afternoon what this government has done in that regard. We have broadened the horizons of the involvement of the government in road transport. We are funding the national highway system.</PARA>

That work is going to help the flow of traffic through his electorate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to road transport reform and the funding that this government is applying to the broader area of roads, as you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the all&hyphen;important Pacific Highway is included in the category we have created of roads of national importance. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would venture to say that you have argued for that every minute of your time in this place&mdash;and you have been the member for Cowper for a very long time&mdash;and it took the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government to deliver on that. The Labor Party spoke about it for 13 years. They 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> signed an agreement at the end of their 13th year and now they are saying, `We were going to do it in the 14th year.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just in closing and most importantly and to the embarrassment of the Labor Party, when we spoke about black spots yesterday the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) was interjecting, `We started it'. They started it but the Keating government also cut the funds for that program. We have reintroduced them and, as I said today, there have been 100 projects around New South Wales funded under black spots.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The very important matter of public importance that the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has raised today&mdash;the failure of the government's transport reform agenda&mdash;opens up, as he did in his remarks, a very important analysis about the consequences of that failure. It will lead Australians who hear this story to ask, `What are you doing to our country?' We are seeing in this country developments we have not seen in Australia before, or at least that we have not seen since the days of the New Guard in the 1930s. As a consequence of the failure of other initiatives, to which I will come in a moment, where attempts were made to smash their way through to achieve change on the waterfront, we now have for the first time in the recollection of anybody in this chamber&mdash;perhaps the first time in our history&mdash;covert operations involving industrial mercenaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the grounds for suspecting that the government might be involved in this, apart from the comprehensive way in which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) ducked the last question? He decided that he did not want to give a guarantee that there was no government money involved. He did not even want to condemn the idea. We gave him the invitation by saying, `All right, if you don't know 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11915"> anything about it, condemn the idea of industrial mercenaries being introduced like this.' Not one word. Not a moment's hesitation to say, `Well, I want to find out a bit more detail.' He said nothing about condemnation&mdash;no guarantees of no government funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of us would be surprised he did not give that guarantee because it feeds exactly into everybody's assessment of why it is likely&mdash;apart from the evidence to which I will refer&mdash;that this measure is in the knowledge of at least some ministers in this government, of their advisers or of consultants they have hired, because they have an absolute obsession with industrial relations on the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was extraordinary that, when the member for Melbourne started his discussion about the situation on the waterfront, we had a point of order from the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) saying that the waterfront is not an issue about transport but an issue about industrial relations. There is a very profound industrial relations question here but it is a transport issue. This is very important to the nature of the transport operations in this country. If these industrial mercenaries come onto the wharf it will have consequences for Australia's transport that will not be good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government have an obsession with the waterfront. When waterfront industrial relations issues come before them, they lose what judgment they have; they do things they would not otherwise do. Whatever the evidence is that points to the connection&mdash;and it is beginning to emerge and there will be more&mdash;at the very least we know one thing: this government have made it possible. First and foremost they have created the climate in which individuals might wish to do this&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="BROWN" NAMEID="5A5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr Robert Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Mr McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. They have advocated it; they have created the climate for it; they have made it possible. Every time the most radical employers have taken the most extreme actions anywhere in Australia they have had the cheer squad led by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). They have created the climate and what the member for Melbourne proved beyond doubt is that they have created the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legal framework within which it can occur. There is no doubt about that. That evidence was displayed here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are plenty of suggestions and indications, for example, in the question from the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) about the way in which the government have facilitated this. We suspect that with their mates in Victoria they have done even more than that. What do we know? We know that the last attempt at waterfront reform failed. In Cairns the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business thought he was in it up to his armpits. The truth is that he was in it just above his nose. And that failed. When did it fail? It failed in the middle of September. When did this project begin to emerge? October. Within weeks of the failure of the Cairns stunt we get the industrial mercenary stunt. The next bit of this desperate attempt to change the waterfront system is being taken not because there is any law being broken on the waterfront, not because people are not working in accordance with their awards and conditions and the laws of the country, but because these are taxpayer Australians who just annoy the government&mdash;they will not do what the government tells them to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know we had a failure in Cairns, and three weeks later we have this new trick. We know the nature of these $20 companies entering into contracts. What do we know? There is no agreement for them to be able to put this labour on any wharf in Australia. They have no approval to operate on any wharf in Australia, yet they have made hundreds of thousands of dollars of commitments to employ these people to do what? They train them. Where are they going to work? Where is the approval for them to operate? Who is going to employ these people? Why have they made this commitment without any government in Australia knowing about it, giving approval for it, guaranteeing some work or coming to, at least, some nod and wink arrangement, guarantee or underwriting?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now begin to think we know what the Prime Minister meant in September when he said, `Watch this space.' It may have been a cover up for being vacant, but we think it was that he knew this operation was under way 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11916"> and he wanted to make some little cunning reference to it&mdash;like he did not want to deny it today. When given the opportunity to deny it he chose not to. We begin to know that there are some Department of Defence connections in this. The first evidence of that is beginning to emerge even today. There are still many questions left unanswered about this, some of which we will pursue tomorrow and if the government were to change its mind and have question time on Friday we would pursue some more. If we are here on Saturday&mdash;more is the pity&mdash;we will still be ready to pursue some more. But we do not mind if we do not sit on Saturday&mdash;it is quite all right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the essence of this issue that is emerging as a consequence of profound failure on the waterfront&mdash;failure to achieve either the legitimate public policy purpose of improved productivity or the real hidden political agenda of smashing the MUA and trying, through that way, to smash the trade union movement in this country? The essence of it is this: it is not a good thing for Australia. We do not need, we do not want and there is no place in Australia for these covert paramilitary style industrial mercenaries to take on Australians going about their lawful business. These Australians are not the enemy. They are Australians. Why are you fighting them? Why are we going to all this trouble? Why is a $20 company able to do all this? Who are these two people whose expertise until now has been advertised as unarmed combat, security and surveillance? But, of course, they are not Rambos. How do these people with those personal characteristics, no background on the waterfront and no money set up two companies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This very much goes to the question of the funding of an operation that has dire consequences for the waterfront in this country, for the harmony of this society, for the health and wellbeing of our country in its operations. And why? Because the government's other attempts to achieve this have failed. We saw it most starkly in Cairns when the minister for industrial relations was ringing Jimbo in the middle of the night. Do you remember the phone calls to Jimbo? I bet Jimbo remembers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them. He thought it was a nightmare. But it was just the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. I wonder if he still believes it was true or whether he thinks he dreamt it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do we have a circumstance where all this could happen with no guarantees, no undertakings, no contracts and no offers of support? `We will just go and commit ourselves to $500,000 a month with $100,000 of air fares alone&mdash;an agreement with the government of the UAE to operate training on their wharf. But we will just take a punt. No worries; we will get the money and maybe someone will let us operate on the wharf.' The way this government is going about reform of the waterfront is un&hyphen;Australian and has no place in this country. As it becomes clearer, it will be rejected by this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry to pick on Mills and Boon. They have a far more reputable and believable story line than some of the nonsense we have had peddled here today. Every time I hear the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) talk about ordinary Australians, I am left wondering if he has actually ever met one. It seems to me that, if he was concerned about the lot of the ordinary people of Australia, as he put it, the people who aspire to work, the people who in small business in my electorate and in so many others around this country want to grow their businesses and generate some real jobs, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11917"> he would in fact be talking to the Maritime Union of Australia about getting real about being part of waterfront reform. He would not be simply making some sort of vain attempt to justify his next preselection. As those on this side appreciate, those opposite are very beholden to the MUA. It is, after all, the jewel in the crown of the union movement in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see that the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) is here. We both participated in a similar debate about the MUA a few months ago. We dealt with the issue of how important the MUA is to the whole business of the union movement in this country. I remember saying at the time that I do not believe the MUA represent workers. They in fact represent the glitterati; they represent the absolute upper crust of the employed people in this country. If they truly represented workers, they would also get behind the idea of proper waterfront reform. There is no way ordinary Australians can get access to jobs on the waterfront in this country because of the MUA and their like. Grandfathers have locked up the jobs for their grandsons. In fact, those who are currently on the wharves are living off the hard work of their grandfathers more often than not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find the matter of public importance before us today a very important one. I think it is vital that we get reform back on track. I would certainly like to debate transport and transport reform and the way that the various modes of transport should link together in this country. I think the matter of public importance before us is very clear, and it is important that we recognise that this government has in its mind an absolute dedication to the notion of reforming all the various modes of transport in this country. It has total dedication to the concept of making all those linkages that are necessary. After all, it is a basic role of government in this country, and has been since 1788, that government should be the vehicle for infrastructure. We have a very large country and a sparse population. If one of the basic tenets of government in this country is not providing proper infrastructure, the means by which we can support those who aspire to run their own business and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grow jobs, if we do not support those sorts of people by providing proper and reliable infrastructure and means of transport, we are letting down the whole country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the final analysis, that sums up the lot of the opposition in today's debate. After all, they have turned their back on the reality of the matter of public importance that they themselves proposed. Instead of talking about means of reforming transport, instead of talking about a dedication to the creation of real jobs and the growing of business in this country to generate those real jobs, they have talked about anything else but. It is all about trying to prop up the MUA and make members of the MUA executive feel well disposed towards them in time for the preselections, which we all know are taking place in the ranks of those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Oh boy, that 14th year would have been a beauty if the Keating regime had been able to hold on on 2 March last year. I cannot fully account for the number of times we have heard in this place all of the things they were going to do if only they had had a 14th year. There is no doubt in my mind that it would have been an absolute beauty, if they had only had that 14th year. Given the record of the 13 years preceding it, we would probably have had a $15 billion black hole, a $15 billion debt to tidy up. The work we have had to do to repair some of the basic institutions in this country would have been a bigger job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talking about repairs, this government has taken upon itself as its first job to repair some of the basic transport infrastructure problems in this country. Our next job is to rebuild and to reinvigorate&mdash;to send the right signal to the people of Australia to get on with the job of growing their business and creating more jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as infrastructure is concerned, be it roads, rail, wharves or airports, the story is in a lot of ways much the same. When we came to government, there was without a doubt a lack of certainty for people who were interested in road construction. We have managed to bring about a number of reforms which provide greater certainty. I think the reconstruction of the Pacific Highway over 10 years is a fine step forward. I think it is a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11918"> good example of just how committed this government is to getting on with the practical things that government should do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk about rail infrastructure. The infrastructure of rail in this country is run down to an abysmal mess. There is urgent need for reform to try to ensure that people have access to the publicly funded infrastructure, the tracks, to try to bring about some competition between competing providers of means of getting along that infrastructure. These are reforms this government is bringing in, and this is a good thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the question of airports. We have already heard about the success of the sale of the Brisbane airport. That will bring in private capital and private determination to what was a publicly owned piece of infrastructure to ensure that we are going to see good results as far as transport in and out of Brisbane airport is concerned. In my own electorate of Moreton, Archerfield Airport is part of the second string of sales which is being overseen so effectively by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), who I see is in the chamber right now. I am very confident, talking to people at Archerfield Airport, that they are looking forward to the regime which will come, which will bring them the opportunity to expand their businesses through this particular piece of infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) has very effectively chaired matters in relation to aircraft movements around Sydney airport, Brisbane airport, as I and the member for Griffith (Mr McDougall), the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) and the member for Bowman (Mrs West) certainly realise, suffered because of the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton). He had one of those cosy deals which flicked all the loud aircraft out of Sydney when it got a little too hot for him a couple of years ago and based them out of Brisbane. So each day we were getting six or eight very noisy old 727s taking off on a Brisbane to Melbourne or a Brisbane to Cairns leg over the top of our electorates. Already, in the space of 20 months, our reforms as far as transport is concerned&mdash;</PARA>

One of the things I and those other three members have managed to do is get those noisy aircraft moved, and the member for Brisbane is an absolute beneficiary out of this, as are the people of the electorate of Brisbane. We have managed to bring about some changes to the approaches and departure routes. We have managed to bring about some good, straightforward, sensible reforms as far as transport is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be a bit tenuous, but nevertheless I will give them the benefit of so many doubts. While we saw those opposite spend $400 million, basically to pay out their mates, the wharfies in the MUA, we really saw no benefit as a result, which is something those opposite fail to realise. It was an absolute failure for the taxpayer. It really was a frank acknowledgment from those opposite of the gross overmanning of the waterfront and of the gross inefficiencies there.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R414">Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment) Repeal and Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  is one of a package of three bills, the other bills being the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R404">Commonwealth Superannuation Board Bill 1997</XREF>  and the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R415">Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment Saving and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1997</XREF> . The main purpose of the bill is to ensure that the Commonwealth's civilian employees can participate in our choice of funds policy announced in the 1997 budget. This will give them greater flexibility and control over their superannuation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, many Commonwealth employees are tied to membership of the public sector superannuation scheme, PSS, or the closed Commonwealth superannuation scheme, CSS. The bill will close the PSS to new members from 1 July 1998 and new employees will be able to choose from superannuation arrangements made available by their employers. From 1 July 2000, CSS and PSS members will, if they wish, be able to cease active membership and choose the alternative superannuation arrangements made available by their employers. The bill will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11922"> provide for the entitlements of CSS members who exercise choice to be based on the resignation deferred benefit, but adjusted to ensure no windfall gains for members or increase in unfunded liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will make a number of other amendments to various superannuation acts covering civilian employees. For example, it includes amendments to the Superannuation Act 1976 to allow CSS members to transfer amounts held in the Australian Government Employees Superannuation Trust or other funds to the CSS fund. It will also amend that act so that reversionary benefits may be paid to a CSS pensioner's spouse or child from a post&hyphen;retirement relationship with fewer restrictions than currently apply. Similar changes are made in respect of spouses' benefits under the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the bill provides for modifications to the superannuation redundancy entitlement arrangements for employees who cease to be CSS members as a result of a sale or outsourcing, in the terms announced in June 1997. In line with the operational date of the new preservation arrangements to apply to the general work force, the bill will provide for preservation from 1 July 1999 of the employer financed component of a CSS lump sum superannuation redundancy payment. These changes will be implemented for PSS members through amendments to the PSS trust deed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also amend the Superannuation Act 1976, with effect from 5 December 1997, to restore its original intention in relation to the acceptance of late elections for preservation of rights. The operation of this provision has been changed progressively by interpretations placed upon it by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court. The changes included in the bill are designed to balance out the interests of the Commonwealth with the interests of current CSS members and former members who seek to make a late election. Without these changes the Commonwealth could continue to incur costs in the order of $10 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, to simplify and streamline the administration of our civilian superannuation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arrangements, the bill includes amendments to simplify the operation of relevant legislation and subsequently repeals a number of acts applying to those arrangements. Savings and transitional provisions relating to these repealed acts are included in the Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment Saving and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1997  contained in this package. The other bill in the package, the  Commonwealth Superannuation Board Bill 1997 , will provide for new rationalised administration arrangements for the closed schemes and for the continued administration of the repealed acts by a new board, the Commonwealth Superannuation Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will result in a net increase in budget outlays as a result of increased funding of future superannuation accruals. However, this will be offset by a reduction in future unfunded superannuation liabilities. The financial implications of the bill are explained in more detail in the explanatory memorandum.

<PARA STYLE="Para">The Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 is the first bill in a package of two bills about NRS funding arrangements. The Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997&mdash;the amendment bill&mdash;mostly deals with the operation and funding of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11926"> National Relay Service, NRS. The NRS is a service that provides people who are deaf or hearing or speech impaired with access to the standard telephone service on terms, and in circumstances, that are comparable to those on which other Australians have access to a standard telephone service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment bill also includes minor amendments to make it clear that lines on the customer side of the telecommunications network boundary are not line links so there will be no obligation to hold a carrier licence or arrange for a nominated carrier declaration in relation to these links; and a carrier that has been declared a nominated carrier over network units that it does not own or operate will be obliged to fulfil carrier related obligations in relation to those network units as though they owned or operated them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current contract for the provision of the NRS expires on 30 June 1998. Under the current wording of the Telecommunications Act 1997, from 1 July 1998 the NRS will be brought under all the universal service provisions and funded out of the universal service levy on an annual basis at least a year after the service is provided. Only carriers are able to undertake universal service provision, because providing these services would necessitate the ownership or operational control of network units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the operation of the NRS is different to universal service provision as: it does not involve the ownership or operation of network units to provide the service to a deaf or hearing or speech impaired person; provision of the NRS is more like a service provider using existing telecommunications networks to deliver a product to select members of the community that have specific disability needs; NRS provision has been by a small niche operator that is reliant on regular funding. The intention is that under the bills from 1 July 1998: the provision of the NRS be open to both carriers and non&hyphen;carriers; the NRS will be provided by a person, who may or may not be a carrier, under a contract with the Commonwealth; and the cost of the NRS will be met by carriers in advance on a quarterly basis depending on their eligible revenue or timed traffic.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Publication of NRS cost estimates will enable the carriers to be levied in advance and publication of actual cost figures after the end of the quarter will enable the actual and estimated costs to be reconciled for accuracy. This information with Australian Communications Authority, ACA, participating carrier assessments will determine carrier levy contributions. Only if a carrier is a participating carrier in relation to the universal service obligation, or USO, when the ACA calculates levy contributions each quarter and is the subject of the most recent ACA USO levy assessment can the carrier be liable for a levy payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NRS will be provided under a new contract as from 1 July 1998. The proposed amendments require a NRS service plan as part of the contract with the NRS provider to include performance standards and timetables for the supply of the service. As part of the contract the NRS service plan will also include how the service will adapt and implement new technology as it becomes available, such as speech to speech for those speech impaired people who find text communications difficult as well as how the NRS provider will conduct the outreach program to promote the service availability to the public, to identify and educate users and potential users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACA will be required to report against the NRS service plan in an annual report to the minister after the end of each financial year. This report will be tabled in both houses of parliament. The minister will also be able to request the ACA to provide advice on the NRS service plan at any stage. Changes to the NRS service plan can be made through contract negotiations between the NRS provider and the Commonwealth. Any failure by the NRS provider to comply with the NRS plan will be addressed in accordance with the NRS contract.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this bill to the House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Managed investment schemes are any type of scheme where an investor purchases an interest from a professional manager who manages the funds received to produce a return. Schemes encompass a wide range of investment products and services including property, equities and cash management trusts as well as smaller schemes such as ostrich farms and pine plantations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Managed investment schemes constitute a large and rapidly growing area of investment activity in Australia. In 1980, when the first retail cash management trust was launched in Australia, there was $2 billion under management. Today, approximately $85 billion is invested in managed investment schemes, and the amount invested continues to grow by around $20 billion a year. These figures demonstrate the significance of managed investments for savings and investment capital formation in Australia. One factor which has made these schemes popular with investors is that they allow them to diversify their invest 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ments into areas which, traditionally, have required large sums to participate. Another is that they also allow investors, who might otherwise lack the skill or confidence to participate in direct investment opportunities, to rely on the expertise of professional investment managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is not concerned with the superannuation segment of the managed funds industry, which includes products provided by superannuation funds and approved deposit funds. Those funds are regulated by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. The segment of the managed funds industry with which the bill is concerned is non&hyphen;superannuation managed investments, which are at present regulated as prescribed interests under the corporations law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the law requires each non&hyphen;superannuation managed investment scheme to have a two&hyphen;party structure comprising a management company, which is responsible for the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operations and investment strategy of the scheme, and a trustee, which distributes scheme income and ensures investments conform with the trust deed. A trustee owes fiduciary obligations to scheme members to supervise the management company on their behalf and in their best interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has become apparent that the law's requirements for these schemes need to be updated. A combination of the commercial property crash at the end of the 1980s, the reductions in asset values of a number of unlisted property trusts, the consequent loss of confidence by investors and the need for legislation in 1991 imposing a standard 12&hyphen;month notice period for redemptions from such trusts focused attention on the regulatory framework for managed investments. On 24 May 1991, the Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee&mdash;the review&mdash;were asked to examine and report on the most efficient and effective legal framework for regulating managed investment schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To assist its consideration of the role of superannuation in its retirement incomes policy, the government of the day asked the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11928"> review to report separately on the regulation of superannuation. The review published its report on this aspect, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Collective Investments: Superannuation </EMPHASIS>(ALRC Report No. 59, 1992), in April 1992. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, which was enacted to strengthen prudential supervision of the superannuation segment of the managed investments industry, requires that there be a single responsible entity&mdash;known as the trustee&mdash;in relation to each superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report on the non&hyphen;superannuation segment of the managed investments industry, entitled<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Collective Investments: Other People's Money</EMPHASIS> (ALRC 65), was tabled on 30 September 1993. Briefly, the review was critical of the current two&hyphen;party structure for schemes and recommended regulatory reform. The review's fundamental recommendation was that, for each scheme, there be a single responsible entity in which the current responsibilities of both the trustee and management company are combined and vested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for regulatory reform has, more recently, been supported by the final report of the Financial System Inquiry, the FSI, released on 9 April 1997. Recommendation 89 of the FSI recommends that the regulatory structure for managed investments be brought into line with that for superannuation funds by introducing a requirement for a single responsible entity. The FSI noted that the introduction of the responsible entity concept would result in clear accountability to members, provide cost savings and be consistent with arrangements for superannuation funds. The government has given very careful consideration to the recommendations of the FSI and the review. As part of that consideration, it has engaged in extensive consultations with key participants in the managed investments industry. The result of that work is the bill before the House today, the key features of which I now want to describe.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Single responsible entity</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have mentioned, the current foundation of schemes is the two&hyphen;party structure of management company and trustee. The review found that this structure was unsatisfactory and may substantially prejudice the interests 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of investors, giving rise to confusion for the management company, the trustee and investors in a scheme about who is ultimately responsible for the scheme's operation. The review concluded that no re&hyphen;working of the current two&hyphen;party structure could overcome its inherent problems of divided powers and responsibilities, and the attendant legal complexity and uncertainty. This conclusion was the basis for the review's recommendation that the law be changed to require a single responsible entity for each scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many investors would be aware, there have recently been cases before the courts which illustrate the confusion about the role and duties of those involved with the operation of schemes. The divided responsibility inherent in the current structure reduces the accountability of both trustee and management company to investors and allows a shuffling of blame in cases where something goes wrong. The responsible entity concept will, by removing the current third party between investors and fund managers, improve investment decision making, while at the same time making the corporate structure for managed investments consistent with other corporate structures. It will also make clear, not only to investors but also to the responsible entity itself, the nature of the responsibilities owed to investors by those managing investment funds on their behalf. This will impose additional discipline on fund managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The single responsible entity concept will clarify and simplify the legal duties and responsibilities of a manager by imposing clear statutory duties in relation to investors and the scheme it operates, and providing a right of civil action against the responsible entity by any member of the scheme who suffers loss or damage because of conduct contravening those duties and responsibilities. From the point of view of investor protection, it will ensure that the liability for any loss of investors' funds, through negligent or illegal activity, rests entirely with the responsible entity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Custody of scheme assets</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In developing the bill, the government has been conscious of the need to afford a high 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11929"> level of protection to scheme assets, and the bill achieves this through several measures. First, the bill imposes certain statutory duties on the responsible entity with respect to the property of any scheme it manages. These duties are to ensure that scheme property is clearly identified as such and that the scheme property is held separately from the property of the responsible entity or of another scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These duties are designed to ensure that scheme assets are not applied, either unintentionally or fraudulently, to the responsible entity's own purposes rather than those of the scheme. In the event of the failure of the responsible entity, the fact that scheme assets are identifiable as such and kept separate from the responsible entity's own assets will help to ensure that those assets are not applied to meet outstanding debts of the responsible entity, but are returned to the investors in the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, a scheme's compliance plan must set out arrangements for ensuring that scheme property is identifiable and kept separate from other property. The scheme's compliance plan is one of the documents that must accompany an application, submitted to the Australian Securities Commission, to register a scheme. The ASC will hence have an opportunity to consider the custodial arrangements a responsible entity proposes to put in place for a scheme. If the ASC believes that the compliance plan does not make adequate provision, among other things, for ensuring the responsible entity complies with the law, including its duties with respect to scheme assets, it may refuse to register the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recall that the ASC from time to time issues practice notes and other guidance which puts members of the public on notice as to the way in which it intends to administer its functions under the law. While it would be a matter for the ASC, the government envisages that there will be guidance to the industry about the criteria by which the ASC will assess the adequacy of compliance plans, including the adequacy of custodial arrangements for the holding of scheme property proposed for schemes. Such guidance could require a scheme to have specified custodial arrangements that vary with the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nature of the scheme, of the scheme property, or the size or characteristics of the responsible entity. These arrangements could contemplate a separate custodian where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the bill requires that the responsible entity holds the scheme property on trust for scheme members. By this provision, the bill imposes trust&hyphen;law obligations on the responsible entity in relation to its oversight of the scheme property. I want to stress that this provision will not prevent a responsible entity from appointing an agent to hold the scheme property separately from other property. Indeed, the government believes that, in many cases, a responsible entity will find that the easiest way to discharge its duty to keep scheme assets separate from its own assets will be to engage another party to take custody of the assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, it may be appropriate in certain cases for a responsible entity to be required to engage a separate custodian of scheme assets. In this regard, the bill's provisions on the ASC's exemption and modification powers, set out in part 5C(11), authorise the ASC, for all cases or on a case by case basis, to declare the bill's provisions to be modified or varied as specified in the declaration. By such a declaration, the ASC will be able to declare that custodial arrangements in relation to property of a particular scheme or class of scheme is to take a particular form, for example, engaging a separate custodian of the scheme property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises that there has been concern in that the bill does not include a requirement that there be a custodian for all schemes. It has, however, decided not to impose such a requirement directly in the law for a number of reasons. The government takes the view that, having regard to the custodial arrangements that I have already detailed, a requirement for a separate custodian is not justified for regulatory purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also concerned that the inclusion of a statutory obligation for a custodian may lead to renewed confusion as to responsibility for a scheme's operation and assets. Certainly, the responsible entity concept means that any custodian of scheme assets would be a bare custodian, obliged to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11930"> deal with scheme property in accordance with the responsible entity's instructions, and the government does not believe that such a custodian should be the sole, or even primary, element of the bill's protection of scheme assets. The government considers that an across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board requirement for a custodian for all schemes would be inappropriate for many schemes and would impose costs that may well outweigh the benefits in terms of improved compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I note that the bill's provisions on custody of assets are entirely consistent with the recommendations of the review I referred to earlier. Indeed, the report of the review states that imposing a requirement for all schemes to have a separate custodian was neither necessary nor appropriate and would be unnecessarily rigid.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Compliance</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains a number of elements to ensure a high level of compliance. A precondition to operating a scheme will be that the responsible entity hold a special licence issued by the ASC. Each scheme with more than 20 investors operated by a responsible entity will also be required to be registered by the ASC. As part of registration, applicants will need to lodge the scheme's compliance plan with the ASC. In addition, the bill will require that a responsible entity have in place a compliance mechanism that takes one of the following forms: a board of directors with at least half of the directors being independent; or a compliance committee with at least half its membership being independent. A scheme will thus have some flexibility in meeting the obligation placed on it to ensure that it monitors its compliance with the compliance plan and the legal obligations on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASC will also play a role in ensuring a high level of compliance through its licensing, registration and surveillance activities in relation to schemes. Moreover, to provide the ASC with added enforcement flexibility, the bill will allow the ASC to enter into legally binding undertakings with the responsible entity of a scheme. The ASC may apply to a court for appropriate orders if the undertaking is breached.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Transition to new regime</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a two&hyphen;year transitional period for existing schemes to comply with the new requirements. The transitional arrangements will be even&hyphen;handed in allowing either the existing management company or trustee to become the scheme responsible entity. The bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on the Commonwealth. In accordance with the corporations agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted on the introduction of the bill into parliament. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Overview of the bill</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In March 1997 the government commenced the corporate law economic reform program as a comprehensive initiative to improve Australia's corporate law as part of the coalition government's drive to promote business and economic development. Proposals for reform of a number of key areas of the Corporations Law have been released for public comment with a view to the introduction of legislation early next year. The corporate law economic reform program also includes a commitment to rewriting the Corporations Law in order to simplify it. This bill will begin that work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Company Law Review Bill 1997  will also improve the efficiency of corporate regulation and reduce the regulatory burdens on business and other users of the Corporations Law. It will bring substantial benefits 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11931"> for both small and large business and has received strong support from the business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill rewrites and improves the core company law rules concerning registering companies, meetings, share capital, financial reporting, annual returns, deregistration of defunct companies and company names, with a view to facilitating business and investment. It will also introduce for managed investment schemes rules similar to those which will apply to companies in relation to meetings, financial reporting and annual returns.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">History of the bill</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill was exposed for public comment in June 1995. In June 1996 the government referred the draft bill to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. This provided an additional opportunity for input by users of the law. The committee's report was tabled in the Senate on 18 November 1996. In its report the committee expressed its approval for the general content of the draft bill. The committee also made 11 specific recommendations which the government has addressed in a separate response to the committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of significant changes have been made to the bill since it was considered by the parliamentary joint committee. The bill will no longer require the annual directors' report to shareholders to include a management discussion and analysis component. While accurate and informative reporting to shareholders is essential to maintaining investor confidence, the detail of reporting requirements should usually be left to best practice in corporate governance, rather than through detailed black&hyphen;letter law. The government considers that companies should be free to decide for themselves whether they should be preparing management discussion and analysis for shareholders, instead of being compelled to do so by law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has also been amended to retain the capacity to register new no liability companies. The retention of these companies recognises their continuing importance to the mining industry. The bill will also allow greater use of communications technology in calling and holding meetings, as recommend 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities in its report on the bill. The assumptions that third parties may make about the internal management of a company have been strengthened. This should reduce the cost of doing business with small companies. Companies that are listed on an overseas stock exchange will be able to buy back their shares on the overseas stock exchange, if the ASC has approved the exchange.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Simplified procedures for setting up and running a company</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will streamline the existing complicated procedure for setting up a company. Under the bill, the only formality will be lodgment of a completed application form. It will therefore be possible to register a company suitable for operating a typical small business by lodging a single form with the Australian Securities Commission, ASC, instead of the several that are currently required. This reform will reduce the cost of registering the approximately 80,000 new companies that are registered each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basic rules that are available for the internal management of companies in table A of the law will be updated and moved into the main body of the law as replaceable rules. As with table A, companies will be able to adopt a constitution displacing some or all of these rules. Proprietary companies will not have to keep their registered office open to the public. This measure will complete the law's recognition of the one&hyphen;person company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Facilitation of electronic meetings and shareholder communications</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rules on meetings in the bill recognise the use of communications technology in calling and holding meetings. For example, companies will be able to serve a notice of a meeting to an electronic address or fax number nominated by a shareholder. Shareholders will be able to send their proxy to the company by facsimile, or by e&hyphen;mail with the agreement of the company. This will reduce the administrative costs associated with company meetings. The bill also facilitates the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11932"> electronic lodgment of annual returns and other documents with the ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proprietary companies will be able to pass resolutions, except resolutions for the removal of an auditor, by arranging for every member to sign a statement setting out the terms of the resolution. Proprietary companies will therefore be able to conduct their business without having to regularly incur the cost of holding formal meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Share capital transactions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will abolish the concept of par value for shares, and court confirmation for capital reductions. These are long overdue reforms which have been a part of company law in the USA for some time, Canada since the 1970s, and New Zealand since 1993. The abolition of court confirmation for capital reductions proposed by the bill will remove a significant constraint on companies seeking to adjust their debt and equity requirements to accommodate changes in the general economic environment. The abolition of par value for shares will allow companies whose shares are valued at a price less than their par value to raise fresh capital without incurring the cost of convening a members' meeting, and without the delay and expense involved in seeking court approval for this. It will also remove an unnecessary complication to the financial affairs of most economically significant companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, these measures will also make it easier for companies to stream capital to shareholders in circumstances where this would minimise tax. It is therefore proposed to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to reduce these opportunities for tax minimisation. A separate announcement has been made outlining the proposed taxation measures. In general terms, it is proposed to introduce a new anti&hyphen;avoidance rule for certain tax preferred capital returns. These measures will be included in a bill to be introduced next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments made by the bill abolishing court confirmation and par value will commence at the same time as the associated taxation amendments. The share capital amendments have been moved into their own schedule in the bill for separate and, if neces 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sary, later commencement. As a contingency against the possibility that the separate schedule will commence after the main body of the bill, the main body of the bill will rewrite the existing par value and court confirmation rules in plain English. The separate schedule will replace those rewritten provisions when it commences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing rules in the Corporations Law concerning the acquisition by a company of an interest in its own shares frequently require companies to seek shareholder approval in a range of situations which do not threaten the interests of the company, its shareholders or its creditors. This imposes unnecessary costs on these transactions. The bill will address this by removing the need for shareholder approval for financial assistance transactions that do not materially prejudice the interests of the company, its shareholders or its creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing legal and technical rules against a company controlling its own shares will be amended so that they are based on the concept of control in the accounting standards, rather than the formal legal holding company and subsidiary relationship. This change recognises that it is possible for a company to exercise actual control over its own shares without there being a formal holding company and subsidiary relationship.</PARA>

This will be achieved through the introduction of a new data protection scheme for new chemical entities, referred to as `active components' in the amending legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, confidential information submitted to the Therapeutic Goods Administration in connection with applications to register products in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods is protected against disclosure, unless release is in the public interest, and also against use by the TGA for its own commercial benefit. Under the new `data protection' scheme to be introduced by this bill, this data will now have five years of `data protection'. During this time, any other company seeking to register a generic copy of the registered product containing, or consisting of, the active component will be required to seek the agreement of the originator company before the TGA can directly or indirectly access or reference the originator company's data relating to the same active component.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Applicants seeking to register generic products containing protected active components may still do so.

Thus, item 6 inserts a provision that will enable the secretary to prevent persons in control of another licensee convicted of an offence against the Therapeutic Goods Act, or a law of a state or territory in relation to therapeutic goods, from immediately applying for and obtaining another manufacturing licence through another person, such as a new or different company. The amendment makes additions to the existing grounds for refusing to issue a manufacturing licence, and the same grounds would provide the basis for cancelling a licensee's manufacturing licence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regulation making powers have been conferred upon the Governor&hyphen;General to enable the administrative functions associated with the issue of import and export permits and licences which are to be exercised by the Secretary to the Department of Health and Family Services to be prescribed under therapeutic goods legislation. The remaining functions will stay under customs legislation. The amendments to the Customs Act 1901 take into account the Governor&hyphen;General's powers to make similar regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 for the grant of import or export permits and licences for therapeutic goods that remain prohibited imports or exports under customs legislation. This will facilitate a far more efficient and responsive regulation, and the development of a risk management approach which maintains Australia's obligations under the three United Nations treaties aimed at preventing illicit drug trafficking and drug abuse, while reducing the regulatory burden on industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other measures included in the bill relate to the power of the secretary to seek the same kind of information about the manufacturing processes used for the manufacture of listable therapeutic goods as for registrable goods. The more detailed information will better equip the secretary to determine whether or not listable goods are suitable for inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and whether they should remain there. Overall, this bill will benefit Australia's therapeutic industry and further enhance Australia's role as a leader in drug regulation. I commend this bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the extended break we were talking about the first of the amendments to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R311">Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill</XREF>  which I am proposing to move in the House this afternoon. I was also commenting on some of the issues which the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has raised about the Labor Party's attitude to small business. I want to, once again, clearly establish on the record that the Labor Party has adopted 100 per cent the fair trading inquiry report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> . We have done so through the shadow ministry adopting its recommendations and this particular document in full. We have done so with the support of every member of the shadow ministry and it has been adopted in full by the entire Labor caucus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business comes into this place and tries to say that there is some difference of opinion between the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and me. Let me again categorically say that that is not the case. When I put forward to the shadow ministry the proposed amendments which are the subject of our debate this afternoon the shadow ministry endorsed them without any dissent and on the basis of the report which I have given. So let us put aside the nonsense which the minister has been peddling around the place that in some way Labor is not signed up to this. Labor is signed up to this document in full. We are not, as the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has said, adopting this as a statement of principles. What an absolute put&hyphen;down of one of the committees of this parliament. What an absolute repudiation of the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) and other members of this chamber who worked assiduously for over 12 months to come up with what was described as one of the best parliamentary committee reports ever done&mdash;one of the best reports that this parliament had seen on any issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11936">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet the minister came in here earlier today and said that this really represented nothing more than a statement of principles. Again, I  reiterate for the benefit of those people here, those members who worked hard on that committee, including even the member for Paterson, members of this house and the small business community: we do not see this as a statement of principles; we see the recommendations in this document as representing the views of small business and small business constituencies that went and spoke to the committee at length and allowed the committee to deliberate on each of these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was saying a little earlier that a number of different organisations had given support for this particular view. I was saying, for example, that one of those organisations that supported the need for this inquiry report to be adopted in its entirety&mdash;in full&mdash;was the United Retailers Association. Lisa Michael is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government must realise that it is crunch time. Peter Reith has the opportunity to put an end to the shameful era of commercial oppression. Mr Howard, stand by your election promises and support small business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The honourable member for Reid, the Leader of the Opposition and I attended a rally in Melbourne where a resolution was passed. There were about 1,000 genuinely interested small business people there. The resolution that was carried without a dissenting voice was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this meeting of retail tenants and franchisees, noting that more than three months has passed since the presentation of the House of Representatives fair trading inquiry report, calls on the federal government to implement its recommendations in full as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, that was the view of just one such meeting. I attended many others. I spoke with people from Western Australia, North Queensland and Victoria. I was in Newcastle with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who is at the table, and he knows the views of the small business community about adopting this report in full. I would expect nothing more than to have some of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those people on the other side now walk away from a committee report that they deliberated on. I see that the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) has come into the place. He was the acting chair of this committee of inquiry for a time. Now he is prepared to roll over. Because the minister says, `Your report is nothing more than a statement of principles,' Copycat rolls over; stroke, stroke, stroke by the minister, and it is a statement of principles. We will just see whether this statement of principles stands up to further scrutiny. I also mention that the people who supported this report wanted it deliberated and considered in full and the recommendations acted on in full by this government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

We are discussing the amendments in the consideration in detail stage. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) has spoken on these particular amendments for 15 minutes, I believe, and not once has he addressed the four amendments he wants to talk about. He has been giving a lot of time to the idea that the Labor Party has accepted the report as a whole. He has not spent any time in identifying how mechanically that would happen.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This only confirms the fact that they want to delay and keep on delaying this particular bill. They do not care about small business. If they cared about small business, they would get this legislation through this place and into the next place as soon as possible. It is due by 1 July next year, but they are probably going to be passing it on to a committee in the next place. They are interested only in delay and in political point scoring. The shadow minister has raised four points but has addressed none of them. He talks about unfairness and unconscionable conduct. Doesn't he yet realise that section 51AA deals with unconscionable conduct? The shadow minister is trying to say that 51AA will be replaced by this concept of unfairness. The unfairness clause will then put 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11937"> into doubt contract law within Australia for businesses doing business with one another. By threatening 51AA, he is threatening contract law in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has consulted some of the leading members of the backbench, in particular the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). He has put a lot of time and effort into meeting chapter 6 of the report. The government has said, `Okay, we cannot change 51AA; it puts too much doubt on contract law in Australia. What we will do to meet what the committee wants is to create a new clause called 51AC.' This is not a broad, one word concept of unfairness but goes into detail as to what unfairness and unconscionable conduct are all about. The shadow minister has not even addressed 51AC. He has not acknowledged it by saying that it is a good idea or a bad idea. All he wants to talk about is bringing in this word `unfairness'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is unfairness? It is unfair that the Labor Party are in opposition. That is what they say. The majority of Australian people do not think that. Those opposite think it is unconscionable that they are in opposition, so any good ideas that we bring in they want to delay. They will delay budget honesty, they will delay certainty with land title in Australia&mdash;they will delay anything that is good for the Australian public, because they know it is unconscionable and unfair that they are in opposition. Being in opposition, they have to maintain their position. I think it was Gareth Evans who said, `We were a good government and we should never apologise.' Part of their apology for being a good government is trying to stop better government. We have here some legislation which is very good for small business. There is no question about that; it is very good for small business. Yet here we have a shadow small business operator who is prepared to delay good legislation for small business because he wants one word&mdash;`unfairness'&mdash;put into the legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, it is interesting that you were the chairman for a part of the time of that inquiry. I was saying a little earlier that, at the time the Reid committee report came out, COSBOA said that this was an excellent report. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It provides the Howard government with a major opportunity to crystallise its commitment to small business and lay to rest any critics in this area. COSBOA urges the Federal Government to provide a positive early response in general and begin implementing what detail it can immediately. Many of the recommendations require little, if any, delay.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what we said, and we agree. The honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) referred to the issue of delay a little earlier. Get the sequence right. We are here in the House of Representatives dealing with the issues. There are some amendments that I am going to propose. When it comes time to vote on three bunches of those amendments, you guys are going to knock us over. We understand that; you have got the numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we are going to persevere with this. This legislation does not go to the Senate until March of next year&mdash;at the earliest. We are not delaying it. The Senate is going to go ta&hyphen;ta at the end of this week when it has dealt with the Wik legislation and then we will all come back next March, after the Constitutional Convention, and we will deal with the bills that are left over, including this one. So we are not delaying anything. It will not be dealt with by the Senate until March next year at the earliest, and then, my friend, it will only be dealt with if the government chooses to put it on its legislative program for those two weeks in March. If it misses that, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11938"> there are two or three weeks in April, and maybe it will get on then. That is fine. Put it on the program and we will debate it again then and we will see how successful we will be. As I was saying, we do not see this as a  statement of principles; we see this as something that is fair and reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Cowan was talking about amendments Nos 1 to 4, which seek to utilise the term `unfair' instead of `unconscionable'. As I have suggested in this place during the course of today, this is directly in line with recommendation 6 of the Reid committee report. The whole of chapter 6 of the Reid committee report details very convincing arguments about why the term `unfair' has wider application than the term `unconscionable'. The amendments moved by the Labor opposition in this set of amendments are&mdash;and listen, because the three of you on the backbench on that side of the House at the moment were members of that committee, and one of you was the chairman&mdash;a direct lift from recommendation 6.1 of the Reid report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cowan and the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), having done 12 months of extensive research and having taken legal advice during the course of this, signed up to this report which says the terminology used should be `unfair conduct' and not `unconscionable conduct'. Now they turn around and come into this place this afternoon and say, `Actually, we don't really believe what we signed up to. We don't believe all those lawyers who came and appeared before the committee.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer the honourable members to pages 162 and 163 of their own report&mdash;and subsequent pages as well. There you have people from the ACCC and APADA, you have lawyers from Baker &amp; McKenzie and you have Robert Gardini all putting advice to you which says that `unfair' is a much better definition to deal with the problems in small business than `unconscionable'. Then, at the end of this, at 6.22, the members of the committee who are sitting opposite all come to the following conclusion:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not accept that the equitable doctrine of unconscionability embodied within Section 51AA of the Trade Practices Act is capable of dealing with the types of conduct complained about to this inquiry and considers that a broader provision is required.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is exactly what we have done, by lifting it from your report and putting it in the legislation that we are proposing now. And you are sitting there saying Labor is somehow not dealing with the issue!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, a little earlier this afternoon the guy running this on your side, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), actually said that the retention of section 51AA was important. Yet, as I said, when you go through and read the comments in the report on which the member for Bendigo, the member for Cowan, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) and a number of others in this place sat, you find they came up with a different conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are you trying to tell this House that you all wasted your time over that 12 months and you now do not believe what you handed down in this place, that you got the hopes of small business up and you do not believe it any more? Here it is in black and white. People rely on black and white from you jokers, and here it is in black and white: `We support unfairness, not unconscionability, because of the tests.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I had the opportunity to visit some members of the automotive industry, and they had some quite remarkable comments to make about the tactics of the shadow minister for small business. All they want is certainty for small business, and that is what 51AC gives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, we have the party of spoilers on the other side. We have had 13 years of determination by the opposition party, now being carried forward by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) to act as a spoiler in preventing the initiative by this government to do something for small business and to do something in a very precise way. I refer to a totally dedicated clause, 51AC, which incorporates the major principles of the report. It goes even further. Paragraphs (3)(a), (b), 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11939"> (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) of clause 51AC spell out exactly what factors may be taken into consideration by the courts in deciding what unconscionable conduct will be for small&hyphen; and medium&hyphen;sized businesses in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at it, you see what has been achieved by the government's adoption of this committee's report. When you look at the comments from people in the automotive industry&mdash;people who were very closely involved in this, such as those representing service station operators and the Motor Traders Association of Australia&mdash;you see that they do not want any delay. They do not want any spoiling tactics by the opposition. The opposition had 13 years, 17 reviews and reports and they are still using spoiling tactics and removing the certainty for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to quote one person in this. He is the Chief Executive of COSBOA, Mr Rob Bastian, who, when the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) responded to the recommendations said, `Not only has the government adopted all the recommendations of the industry, science and technology committee's report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS>, but they have thrown in a free set of steak knives as well.' I think that is the text of what he said. In other words he was saying that this is tremendous progress for small business. It will provide them with certainty. Section 51AC spells out all the factors that the courts may take into consideration. That will provide small business with certainty in this whole area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also had the opportunity to talk with people in the automotive industry, and they were very keen to get this implemented, because they see this as being the foundation for the whole report and the initiatives that have been adopted by the government. Obviously, we are also keen, but we have these spoiling tactics from a failed party who neglected small business for 13 years. They tried to delay their own legislation. They had the Schacht report and the Beddall report, and what did they do with them? All they did was hold up progress and give small business no certainty in this country. Small business have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been waiting on the finalisation of this matter and for the legislation to go through this chamber. It does not do the Labor Party any good to come with a rearguard action now and yet again be the party of spoilers for small business, trying to create problems with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation has been well thought out. It provides protection for small business in a whole range of areas and I have spelt them out. If the shadow minister cares to read clause 51AC and all those clauses, he will understand it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to hear the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), squirming and trying to get out of why he is going to vote against his own report and suggesting that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), because he had spoken to a couple of people, was pushing the point of view that small business actually was on board. Are these the same people the minister has gone to, in his typical fashion, and said, `Look, you either sign up to us or you get nothing'? Is this the same minister who has said that? Is this the minister for small business who has gone to these small business organisations and said, `Sign up to us. Don't listen to what the Labor Party is putting up in the amendments, which are a direct lift out of the Reid committee report that you all said was terrific before, or you will get nothing'? Is it the same minister who is doing all that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me return to the argument about unfair versus unconscionable, which is what we are talking about in this first set of amendments, for the benefit of my good friend on the other side, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), and for the benefit of the minister. The Reid committee report at 6.57 on page 176 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that it is necessary to amend the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade Practices Act 1974</EMPHASIS>  to provide a general statutory standard of fairness in commerce broader than the present equitable doctrine of unconscionability. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11940"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You said it again there. You talked about the definitions that are in this report. Paragraph 6.70 at page 179 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The word `unfair' has the strong advantage of being widely understood, being part of the every&hyphen;day moral vocabulary of all Australians. Indeed, fairness is the social value central to the maintenance of social cohesion and the legitimacy of the social system. It has the added advantage of directly addressing the problem as it is usually articulated. The term `unfair' is also used within the US law.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to give an example of where that occurs in US law. At recommendation 6.1 at paragraph 6.73 on pages 181 and 182, it talks about new section 51AA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unfair.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister has said, `We are not going to go this route. We are not going to talk about unfairness. We are not going to talk about something which in commercial terms is easier to understand. We are going to talk about unconscionability because in the existing trade practices legislation unconscionability is mentioned in reference to consumers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem, based on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS> report, that unfairness is an easier test to apply. It means that small businesses that do not have the wherewithal and the access to financial resources and legal minds to fight very lengthy and costly litigation would find that a definition of unfairness is going to be far better to pursue than unconscionability. Unconscionability, as defined in the Reid committee report&mdash;and I will go back to it again because it is great reading when you talk about what unconscionable conduct is&mdash;has its origins in equity. I refer the parliamentary secretary to page 158 of this report. He has obviously not read it, and I think he should, so I am giving him a few places to start. The report states on page 158:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concept of `unconscionable conduct' has its origins in Equity. In its broadest sense, it is used to describe conduct by a party who stands to receive a benefit from a transaction which, in good conscience, should not be allowed to stand. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And on it goes. It talks about this idea of consciousness and a decision to in some way disadvantage another party in a commercial transaction and a relationship.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising in support of the amendments moved by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), I put the challenge to the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) to stop the politics and at least use one of their five&hyphen;minute grabs to tell the House why they have changed their minds since signing off on the report. We have had the political line. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman) can sit there with a big grin, but he is the one who has pushed the parliamentary line, the smooth Reith line, the typical Reith tactic, the political line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is being attempted here by the opposition is to have put in place the recommendations of the committee based on the committee's report. We have had people saying today basically that the new 51AC reflects&mdash;and I do not know whether the word has been used&mdash;nearly in totality what has been proposed in 51AA, which is the amendment by the honourable member for Cunningham. I would like an explanation; I would like a justification for why there are certain omis 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11942"> sions from the clauses that we have asked the courts to have regard to about unfair conduct as compared with the new 51AC that is being proposed on unconscionable conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of those, which is contained in the recommendations of the committee's report, was `the harshness of the result'. There is no mention in the proposed 51AC. The second item is (c) in the proposal put by the honourable member for Cunningham&mdash;`whether or  not a person has suffered from any disability'. Perhaps I can provide the answer to that; that is one of the important bases of unconscionable conduct&mdash;the special disadvantage clause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get it clear that in the committee's report there was thorough discussion of the unconscionable conduct provisions. A dismissal of that as not being appropriate was not done lightly; it was taken very seriously. The proposal to put in place an amendment based on unfair conduct was done very consciously to send out a signal to small and big business that the parliament&mdash;both sides of the parliament&mdash;was fair dinkum about getting a change in behaviour. I am not really interested in a discussion of the past 13 years; I am interested in what this parliament can do now, and getting it right now. The unfair conduct proposal is very broad and is the type of thing that small business requires. It is acknowledged that unconscionable conduct is a much narrower doctrine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the committee's report one important comment is made. A lot has been made of the issue that unconscionable conduct has some previous basis in law. In fact that is one of the problems. Paragraph 6.72 on page 180 states, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In adopting a similar approach the opportunity would again arise to make clear to the courts the intention to broaden the equitable doctrine of unconscionability and that the word `unfair' is intended to encompass the words unconscionable, harsh and oppressive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But it is on the basis that already unconscionability has a connotation. It already has a connotation that courts would have to take on board. I acknowledge that clause 3 tries to give an indication of where this parliament now thinks it is different. But my point is that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it gives clarity in proposed section 51AA about unfair conduct if we go to the proposals in clause 2 in exactly the same basis. This parliament would be indicating what we believe to be unfair conduct and we would be saying that this is a very serious matter, that we are in fact putting in place something that might be innovative because we see that it is important to ensure that small business is given the appropriate protection. That is what this debate should be about. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

If you cannot change 51AA to include `unfair', why cannot you then have your own clause at 51AC specifically for small business?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I must just correct a couple of things that have been said. Firstly, I should point out that the fatuous phantom from Paterson, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), was not a hard worker. He came to one hearing. There were members of the government who were; there were some members of the government who worked very hard on this report, and I have always respected that. The member for Paterson was not one of them. That fatuous phantom turned up by accident to one hearing. So he has a bit of a hide to start talking about this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I should draw the House's attention to the performance of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), whom we had a lecture from this afternoon about the previous 13 years. I did a check of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>s. In the previous 13 years, when the current minister was in opposition between 1984 and 1996, he managed to mention small business 19 times&mdash;pretty important stuff; he mentioned it 19 times. Let me tell you when he mentioned it. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11944"> He mentioned it four times in 1985, twice in each of two speeches, again in 1986 and again in 1990. But the main times he mentioned it were in 1991 and 1992, when he mentioned 10 times how great a GST would be for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the minister lectures us about the last 13 years, yet as a member of parliament, representing his constituents in this place, he barely ever mentioned small business. The main time he talked about it was in regard to a GST. What is more, from 1993 to 1996 he did not mention it at all. Not once did the  words escape his lips. The member for Flinders did not mention the words `small business' at all in the last parliament. So he should not have the gall to come in here and lecture us about how concerned he is about small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening here is an act of treachery, treachery against two groups. One group includes me. That is the group which went into this inquiry and report in good faith. We attended hearing after hearing&mdash;and in some cases there were more opposition members present than government members. The chairman well knows that if it was not for us in some cases he would not have had a quorum. He knows that and I know that. There are nine of them and five of us, but on a number of occasions if we had not been there, there would not have been a quorum or a hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We worked hard at it. We went through days and days of deliberation on this report. We had a discussion paper about the implications of this part of the act. We knew it was one of the hardest bits of all. We did a deal. We signed up as a group of people to this report. We have been betrayed. None of you guys told us you were going to rat. We all knew that when it came to this place it would be tough going, but we were agreed that it had to be done. The treachery that is going on is about us. So don't come in here and start lecturing us about the last 13 years or about how serious you are about small business, because you betrayed us. We took you in good faith. Don't ever ask me to trust you again because there has not been the slightest attempt by you to mitigate your treachery.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second group of people you betrayed are the people who made submissions to you. Some of those people worked their butts off. Some of the legal advice we have from witnesses would have cost an absolute fortune. They trusted the committee and its chair to act in good faith. The question of unfair trading was critical to the whole report and the advice that we got all the way through was that it could be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand how systems work, how governments work and how politics work. The fact that you are in here championing a cause that you betrayed speaks poorly for you. You would have been better to have shut up, to have gone quiet and let your minister defend the cabinet decision. To come in here and defend the cabinet decision which you got rolled on does you no credit. We accept the solidarity. We accept the probability that you got rolled. Your minister could not get through cabinet what you wanted but you do not have to come in and defend him. Where is he? None of you here were in the cabinet. The ones who made the decision are not even in the chamber. Where is the minister who is so concerned about this area, such an important part of the economy?

He is moving to repeal the existing 51AA and to insert a new 51AA dealing with unfair conduct. Even this is an admission of their failure. The ALP introduced 51AA in 1992. It is, therefore, trying to amend its own legislation, which it recognised was flawed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP proposal is flawed. It would leave business, small business in particular, worse off&mdash;not better off. It only applies to small business within the Australian Bureau of Statistics definition. The ABS definition is very restrictive, especially in the area of small retailers. It does not apply to business that employs more than 20 persons. The amendment is not drafted to apply to 20 persons per shop, so a small business employing, say, six employees in four smaller shops, for example fruit and vegetables or whatever type of activity, would be excluded by your amendment. What is worse, the ALP would deny that business which missed out on the ABS definition even the existing legal right under 51AA because they repeal that section. In other words, that small business gets nothing, and even their existing rights are taken away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is too late for the members on the other side of the chamber, the party of spoilers, to come in now after their failures of 13 years and 17 reports and reviews and delay and change this bill. The bill is very clear. As my colleague the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), who did such an excellent job on the committee, has spelled out, 51AC(3)(d) states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on, or any unfair tactics were used against, the business consumer or a person acting on behalf of the business consumer by the supplier or a person acting on behalf of the supplier in relation to the supply or possible supply of the goods or services;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is one of 11 factors which we have included in the legislation, which may be taken into consideration by the courts&mdash;a very clear direction under the bill to direct that, and it relates to unfair conduct or unfair tactics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated, the government has responded to the report in a most significant way. It

I think the role of the parliamentary system is to take on board comments that are put to us&mdash;and there were plenty of legal comments made&mdash;and to analyse them. Those sorts of comments have been repeated by his colleagues who served on the committee, and I think they sell the committee system short.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say something that might come as a surprise to those opposite: I acknowledge that, since being elected to this place back in 1986, I may not have taken notice of small business issues as much as I should have. I make no apology for that. I can hardly not say that because when I finally got the opportunity to talk on this report I indicated that the conduct of this inquiry was a learning curve for me. I acknowledged the input of the members of the committee who had expertise in small business, and I learnt a lot off them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also indicated that the outcome of the committee's report came as a very pleasant surprise to me. It verged on capital `I' intervention if only small `i' intervention&mdash;and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11946"> that coming from a committee that had a majority of members from the coalition was something that was very pleasing. That is why I feel so strongly about trying to defend what the committee put in place. That is why I find it quite easy to come before the chamber tonight and support the amendments of the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) that put in place the recommendations. I am concerned&mdash;and some offence might be taken when I say this&mdash;that the honourable members opposite that were part of the inquiry are playing their part in unwittingly watering down what we intended as protection for small business. That is my great concern, and it is based on the discussion we  had about the equitable unconscionable conduct provisions that have prevailed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in the debate on the second reading, those unconscionable conduct provisions have never done much good for small business. I got a bit carried away in my earlier contribution and did not quite quote a part of the report that I want to place on the record. At page 178, paragraph 6.66, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee is concerned that this form of words would not provide a sufficiently clear signal to the courts of the intention to broaden the equitable doctrine of unconscionability. Employing the word `unconscionable' in the statutory standard would retain in the Act the legal history associated with that word.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the legal history associated with that word.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, I acknowledge that honourable members believe that the new 51AC, I think it is clause 3, relating to those matters that may be taken into account, will in some way influence. But I am really concerned that the legal history is what will prevail. We have to understand that if that is the case we are not doing the right thing by small business, unless we ensure that the provisions that they can use are strengthened.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to answer a couple of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> questions put by the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins). He talked about some of the concerns associated with small business. The committee heard a lot from retailers, from distributors and from wholesalers and a whole lot of different small businesses. Certainly, having been a small business operator&mdash;having dealt with it as a shopping centre manager and a franchisor and having had to look after businesses and things like that&mdash;I know that there is a thing called hard&hyphen;ball business. The trouble with hard&hyphen;ball business is that there is too much of a grey line between what is hard&hyphen;ball business and what is unconscionable conduct. In the real estate area, there is a tendency to be more in favour of the owner of the property, which is what agents are for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major problem was that small businesses could never get this unconscionable conduct tested in court. They could not do it because they could not afford the process and there was not any clear definition for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take the member for Scullin back to what he was saying before about parliamentary committees. I have great faith in the parliamentary committee system. I think that it should not necessarily show any bias, and we should be treating it as a parliament. I think this is one of the first committees that I have served on that brought down a report that did not have bias in it; it went for the facts. We were all conscientious in what we wanted to achieve&mdash;that is, some protection for small business. We said, `We have to change section 51AA and get a better definition of `unconscionable'.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We never considered&mdash;I want to bring the member for Scullin back to those discussions&mdash;putting in another clause, an extra part of the act. The problem those in government had related to how we get a better definition of `unconscionable' in 51AA without threatening contract law with bigger businesses and the way they operate? What better way then than to add another clause, 51AC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By implication, those opposite who are arguing this particular point want to take 51AC out of the legislation and only add another definition into 51AA&mdash;the definition of `unfair'. Do you think that small business 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11947"> would get a better deal from that? Would they get a better deal if they took out a clause specific to small business and then go back to where big business operates? My personal view is that they would not. Here in 51AC are clear descriptions as to what a court must consider&mdash;not only a court but those who actually operate in small business and those who deal with small business and small businesses themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hard ball business line is clearly defined in 51AC&mdash;unconscionable conduct in business transactions. Subclause 51AC(3)(d) clearly makes reference to undue influence and unfair tactics. The opposition wants the word `unfair' added to it. Unfair tactics was  not part of the recommendations. I have not picked it up as part of the recommendations. Here it is clearly in the legislation&mdash;`unfair tactics'. There is the word `unfair' that they want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have 51AA dealing with the big business corporations and playing hard ball business, we have 51AB and then we have 51AC&mdash;consumer law for small business. In clause 3(d) of 51AC we have undue influence and unfair tactics. That was the major concern&mdash;having access to the courts and having a clear definition of where the line is drawn. The government has clearly identified where the line is drawn under 51AC. All the opposition wants to do is get rid of 51AC, go back to 51AA and add the word `unfair'. Surely that will create more court confusion and more lack of access for small business.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to make a couple of comments, firstly, about this definition of small business. It is true that the Bureau of Statistics definition of a small business for a manufacturing industry is 100 employees and for non-manufacturing it is 20 employees. I refer to the contribution of the chairman of the committee, the member for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bendigo (Mr Reid). Unfortunately, he is not here; he has left the chamber, I regret to say. I would like to ask him: how many businesses in the electorate of Bendigo would fall under the small business banner under the ABS definition as opposed to the $1 million figure used in this bill?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, we cannot ask a National Party member about farmers and small businesses who may benefit from the wider definition proposed by the opposition because there is not one National Party member participating in this debate this afternoon. I regret that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I need to really build on the remarks of the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) by reminding government members that yes, they did win the election and yes, we may have done some things or not done some things for small business in our term of office. But why are we playing the man all the time? Why can't we have a debate about what is in the best interests of small business and farmers? Is that so outrageous? Why can't we just set aside action or lack of action in the past and agree, as the honourable member for Scullin has said, and as I have said in my contribution, that we welcome the report and, indeed, we welcome this legislation as moving the debate forward? The question is: can we move it forward even further?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) can assist me because `unconscionable' has a legal definition. In pursuing and pushing this legal definition set by precedent&mdash;not by legislation, by the courts&mdash;could he help me by giving me an estimate&mdash;maybe the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman), who always has so much to say, could help&mdash;of how many small businesses will benefit because they are able to demonstrate illiteracy or lack of education. There is no response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about age? They can use the issue of age, presumably extreme age, under `unconscionable' as a mechanism for getting relief from big business. Could the parliamentary secretary or the member for Cowan in their next contribution give me an estimate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11948"> of how many small businesses or farmers will benefit under that provision? What about infirmity of body or mind?</PARA>

No, that is not quite right. Those on this side passionately believe in the work they have done; the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who was the chairman of the committee, got up in here and said, `We have changed our minds because we are a committee that does not have any legal people on it.'

So there is no case law to worry about. What we are saying is that this committee&mdash;this learned bunch of individual members of parliament&mdash;with all the evidence that was given to them, said they wanted to see `unfair conduct' included in the legislation when dealing with small business. How silly the Labor Party was because we came along and said, `We believe you. We think that is a great idea. We will make it easy for you and

What we are doing with the Trade Practices Act at the moment in clause 51AC is providing a set of rules for the people who deal with small business. I just do not understand why you would want to deny small business and micro&hyphen;business in Australia the opportunity of having consumer law for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are you denying small business and micro&hyphen;business this opportunity? For some unknown reason, for some political point scoring&mdash;I do not know&mdash;you want to deny them that opportunity. You want to take away additional weight that the government has added to the committee report. That is what you want to do. The unfair aspects of what you are talking about are in fact included in clause 51AC. Clearly, they are there. You are in self&hyphen;denial if you say that they are not. As for this treacherous thing you talk about, it is unbelievable that you cannot see this as a benefit for small business. Maybe it is because you do not understand small business. Maybe it is because you have never actually dealt with small business. Talking to them does not actually mean that you actually deal with them. Have you actually gone through

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, in terms of those who agree with us, I refer the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) to comments in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS>  regarding this legislation, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S124">Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997</XREF> , to make him aware&mdash;which he may not be&mdash;that his colleague the Fatuous Phantom of Paterson has been requested by the Newcastle small business community to support these amendments. This is the same member who made a fatuous promise a few weeks ago to cross the floor on chicken meat. Chicken Meat Bob, the Fatuous Phantom, was going to cross the floor! Small business in Newcastle is asking him and his colleague Senator Tierney right now to cross the floor  on this one. If he does, we will get it through very quickly and it will become law before April. It is dead simple. This can be adopted very quickly if those coalition members&mdash;the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), the member for Cowan, Senator Tierney and others who proclaim their support for small business&mdash;were to adopt the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cowan's idea that these matters were not discussed is not just wrong but actually offensive. He is saying we did not think of them. What he is saying we did not think of is that we should have a special law only for a certain group of people and that we put that in the Trade Practices Act. The group of people those opposite are talking about is those where turnover is a million dollars. That might sound like an awful lot to many people, but for people selling petrol, for example, and for many farmers&mdash;as my colleague mentioned earlier&mdash;a million dollar turnover on very low margins is actually not that much at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we on that committee are very aware of the boundary between small business and non&hyphen;small business. We are very aware of micro and medium sized enterprises and of all those different boundaries. Quite frankly, the last thing we wanted to do was to create yet another special bed of red tape, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> another special category applying only to certain people, which would encourage all people to break up their businesses into smaller and smaller sizes to fit within the special provisions. This clause 51AC is a recipe for disaster because it is going to encourage businesses to break themselves up into smaller parts to fit within the provisions. We did not want that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on the committee were very aware that we could make recommendations for particular cases. We wanted to change the Trade Practices Act in a couple of ways. The first thing to keep in mind is that small businesses are consumers. They have no protection as consumers. Small businesses are inferior in bargaining and negotiation. We wanted them to have equality&mdash;not special laws, just equal laws. And the fact is that there were no laws that covered them because of unconscionability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said over and over in this place this evening that the word `unconscionable' does not come with clean hands; it has a lot of meaning established in precedent. The report goes to those meanings over and over again and says it must be broadened. We looked at adding words to it. We looked at adding `harsh' and `oppressive' and other words and we concluded that they would not improve the situation. The only way to broaden it was to have the act changed, to get rid of that word altogether and to bring in a new word that had its own connotations and also had something else a bit special: a touch of morality. Within Australia the word `fairness' has a special meaning to us. We are, after all, a country of a fair go. We use the word daily. It is used with the idea of a handshake, of a deal and of people negotiating in good faith and in fairness. We wished to enshrine in our legislation what we see as being the Australian ethos of fairness, and we discussed that in detail for a long time over more than one day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we knew what we were doing. The audacity of the member for Cowan to come in here and say we did not understand and we did not know what we were doing is not just treachery; it is disgraceful and a misrepresentation of both the committee's deliberations 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11953"> and its intent. As for what the government is doing, cabinet has rolled the committee members and these backbenchers are defending a cabinet decision which is indefensible. Small business wants a fair go. We called the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS>. We asked for a clause about unfair trading. The logic is inescapable. The symmetry is there. We knew what we were doing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst my colleague was talking, and in response to a question that was addressed to me earlier by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) about why we were pursuing this issue of unfairness compared with unconscionable, I took the opportunity to compare the 51AC proposals that the government is putting forward and the amendments that we are proposing at 51AA, `Unfair conduct'. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the honourable member for Cowan that there is absolutely nothing in legislation proposed either by the government or by us which is going to disadvantage small business. In fact, we will argue strongly, and we are arguing strongly, that in respect of unfair conduct, for all the legitimate reasons that we have already outlined stemming from the report on fair trading, in which the honourable member for Cowan was an active participant, we believe that the unfair conduct provisions are preferable because of the tests in law, because of the fact that it opens it up to many more small business enterprises and because they feel they can get a better deal. They are words that your government, member for Cowan, use quite regularly&mdash;`wanting a better deal, a fairer deal'. We are saying that the unfair conduct provisions are part of that because they go to those sorts of issues&mdash;they go to harshness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) raised the very point: the comments and the recommendations which you as a member of that committee made about those sorts of issues are omitted from the government's own proposals here. And you are now saying that you believe that it was because you had not thought of it before or that the committee is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not a bunch of lawyers and could therefore not pursue it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me ask a question of the honourable member for Cowan or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman) or, indeed, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), who has now joined us. What is the difference between your proposals here on unconscionable conduct and what originally was proposed in 1995 by Chris Schacht, as the then minister for small business, on unconscionable conduct or in the private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on better business conduct?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I presume in the case of the Leader of the Opposition it was because it was an opposition private member's bill and we all know the fate of those. So it really is a rhetorical question. I accept that from the parliamentary secretary. If you have now picked up the unconscionability issue, which Kim Beazley had before this place as a private member's bill in May 1996, why didn't you deal with it then? Why didn't the government pick it up at the time and deal with it then? Why now hide behind this smokescreen of unconscionability when what the committee recommended, having taken evidence, required unfair conduct? Why, when the opposition comes along and says, `Having adopted that report, we are quite happy to facilitate this through the other House as quickly as we can because it reflects what we believe is going to give a better deal to small business on unconscionability,' are we still mucking around with this? Why is the government not accepting a report in which the majority of its own members came forward and said, `Unfair conduct should be pursued; for all the reasons outlined in chapter 6 of the Reid committee report unconscionability is a difficult issue in a legal sense'? Why is the government still mucking around with this issue? Why is this the case?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Cowan interjects, `This is better'&mdash;`this' meaning what the government is proposing with 51AC. The fundamental point that we stick by is that we do not believe that it is better. Having examined very closely what the committee, in which you participated as a member, put forward to this parliament after extensive research and discussion with the small business constituency, we believe that what you as a committee put forward was sound and reasonable. We do not believe&mdash;and this is the fundamental difference&mdash;that 51AC is a better proposition. We do not believe that that which you are suggesting on unconscionability in business transactions is a better proposition than that which you and the member for Paterson, as members of the committee, recommended on unfair conduct.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LL6">Mr BOB BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about the amendments and the comments made by the member for Newcastle. He made comments about attendance at committee meetings. As I said, you would know yourself, Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Deputy Speaker, from your role at the meetings we had, that the member for Newcastle turned up late because not one of his own colleagues bothered to pick up the phone and get him, because they find him an absolute bore. Perhaps that is the reason why. But there are other reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also heard the member for Newcastle talking about the contribution of the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) on small business, so I did a little database search. Since entering parliament in 1983, Anti-enterprise Allan has spoken a total of six times on small business. The first time was on the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Amendment Bill in 1983, where he spoke a little bit about R&amp;D&mdash;not much. On the Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill on 17 February 1987&mdash;only a four-year gap&mdash;he spoke a little bit about Australian industrial development interest rate subsidies. He spoke then on 24 May 1988 on the Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill&mdash;he has really picked up his tempo now; he had it down to once a year&mdash;on research and development. Then on 11 April 1989 he spoke on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) about the steel plan. Finally, really winding up the tempo on 10 September 1992, he spoke about the Australian Taxation Office and how it did not have a small business unit. On 28 September 1993 there was again a great contribution to small business. He spoke about the NIES programs and how they would benefit people getting into business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He claims to have been on all these committees and to have been a great contributor to helping small business in its plight, but where was the argument, where was taking the point forward for his government of the day? By the same token, from 28 September 1993 until 1996 there was no comment at all about small business&mdash;not one word about the Beddall report or any contribution. This man is an absolute hypocrite. He goes around talking about his support for small business. He would not even know what a balance sheet is. He has absolutely no understanding. He claims to be an academic, has never been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11955"> in small business, but here he is, the great saviour of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going to the amendments, part of the debate seems to be about the difference between `unconscionable' and `unfair'. Wouldn't it be more realistic, to do what small business wants, to get something in place so that out in the community they can get on with their work, on with their business, and to stop the suffering delivered to them by the former Labor government? Unconscionable conduct and the problems with retail tenancy did not start on 2 March 1996. These have been around for years and years. I read out all the contributions of the member for Newcastle, known as Anti&hyphen;enterprise Allan in another life, and before that he was the Grim Reaper because he gets such joy out of unemployment figures that he created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think those opposite need to be brought to account for the fact that they did absolutely nothing in the 13 years they were in government, and they would continue to do nothing. This whole debate now is about a delaying process and putting at risk of bankruptcy even more businesses. The reality is that this legislation should be passed and then we  should look at where we should go from there. Let us build a foundation stone we can go forward from.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am most wounded by suffering that general warning! However, I refer honourable members to the explanatory memorandum, because a furphy that has been put into this debate is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that in some way the opposition's sponsorship of the amendment to section 51AA is on the basis that it is advantageous to big business or it is something that they want. In the impact statement aspect of the explanatory memorandum, option 4, the government's proposed action to insert a new section 51AC, under `Costs' there is a dot point which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Larger firms view this approach as unduly trenching on their contractual and property rights. Large firms would also bear increased compliance costs from such an amendment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Option 5 is to adopt committee recommendation 6.1, which is the proposed amendment to 51AA that the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) has moved. What do we find under `Costs'? There is a dot point that says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Larger firms view this approach as unduly trenching on their contractual and property rights. Large firms would also bear increased compliance costs from such an amendment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I score that as not a nil&hyphen;all draw but a one&hyphen;all draw. So let us not hear this furphy that in some way the proposal we are putting forward is done so on the basis that it helps big business or that it is being pushed by big business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect is the comments that are made in the explanatory memorandum when talking about option 5, that is, the adoption of the committee's recommendation 6.1, the amendment to 51AA. Under `Benefits' it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">imposition of a broad duty of good faith in commercial transactions which would be likely to cover most of the issues raised during the Fair Trading inquiry;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will meet small business expectations about the need for general protection against exploitation by larger firms; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the codified nature of the Committee's recommendation would assist compliance once initial legal action clarifies the meaning of key terms.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not worried about that proviso at the end&mdash;`once initial legal action clarifies the meaning of key terms'&mdash;because both the government and the opposition in discussing their proposals acknowledge that there will be an element of test cases surrounding these issues. Whilst the government is trying to say 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11956"> that, because the equitable doctrine of unconscionability has been tested in law, it has a basis, and on the other hand says it has beefed it up through its clause 3, there are elements there that have to be tested. All clause 3 says is that these are matters of which the courts may take regard&mdash;may. As I understand it, `may' is a very important legal term because it does not in any way indicate that there is any definitiveness about matters. Likewise, under our proposal on 51AA, we ask that courts may take regard of certain items. I acknowledge that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This really boils down to not the argument about whether or not small business should get special treatment. What small business wants is the ability to have access to an element of the Trade Practices Act that will give them some defence over behaviour that is seen to be unfair. That is why there was this discussion about whether, if they were actually consumers, they would have better protection. Again, they were not necessarily looking for anything special; they were looking for elements that were available to others. That is why this amendment to 51AA fulfils the types of indications that small business wanted and the types of indications that were discussed by the committee as being  required. That is why 51AA as proposed to be amended will give that type of protection to small business.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The amendment we are proposing to the government's legislation replaces the $1 million transaction limit as foreshadowed in the government's bill to the definition of small business. We believe that this will ensure that small businesses such as service stations will be covered by the legislation and that it removes any uncertainty. It will also ensure that only small businesses can utilise the unfair provisions&mdash;it does not mean it is going to be the large businesses that my friend the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) raised  earlier when we were talking about the unfair versus unconscionable provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment has the support not only of the small business community but also of many organisations. I have had representations from service station owners, from APADA, Wren Oil, Gulf Petroleum and Mulhearn Waste Oil Removal Pty Ltd. I have letters from many of those organisations which say that they desperately want to see that change because they do not believe the $1 million is going to give adequate protection, particularly in the service station areas. Our view is that this minor amendment, in the broad scheme of things, will still enable the government's proposals to be picked up, but it does include the definition of small business from the ABS rather than the $1 million issue. I commend that particular amendment to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The definition of small business and trying to target anything towards small business is a difficult issue. I cannot say that the committee was able to come up with any distinct ideas about this, but the report states in the introduction at 1.6 on page 2:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Committee has previously defined small business as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. being independently owned and managed;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. being closely controlled by owner/managers who also contribute most, if not all of the operating capital; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. having the principal decision making functions resting with the owner/managers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A definition like that would not really do anything for this particular clause in the bill, and I accept that. But the committee went on to say that the definition of small business can be qualified by a size component and used the definition that is being proposed by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) in this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading debate I raised one element about this $1 million figure, and I have not yet received an answer about the transactions; that is, whether a contract over five years at $200,001 or a 10&hyphen;year contract at $100,001, which would go over the $1 million, would mean that people would not have the relief of this proposed amendment. I think that is something the government has to take on board and give a proper answer about. There are many businesses we would define as small business which would be in this category of having a five&hyphen; or 10&hyphen;year contract that would take them over the $1 million mark.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments propose to introduce a uniform retail tenancy code utilising the Commonwealth's corporations power under section 51(xx) of the Australian constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite comments that were made by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in the House yesterday, in answer to a dorothy dix question, we are not proposing under any circumstances to introduce any taxing powers, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman) should know better as well. The way our amendment has been drafted specifically precludes that particular issue. It was one part of the advice the MTAA received and they suggested that that might be one way for this to be put in place. We clearly ruled that out and it is not part of this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of this uniform retail tenancy code, we have looked at a number of those codes and we have also drawn on the recommendations of the fair trading inquiry report. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11966"> In the amendment I have moved, under division 2&mdash;Uniform retail tenancy code&mdash;that is a direct lift of recommendation 2.2 of the Reid committee report. Minimum term of retail shop and service station leases is recommendation 2.4; lease renewals is also recommendation 2.4; lease assignment is recommendation 2.5; standard set of lease provisions is recommendation 2.9; precontract disclosure is recommendations 2.5 and 2.7; market rent review is recommendations 2.6 and 2.7; disturbance to trading is recommendation 2.11; retail tenancy mix is recommendation 2.10; merchants associations to be consulted is recommendation 2.8; statements of outgoings is recommendation 2.8; and dispute resolution provisions is recommendation 2.3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under enforcement, retail lease tribunals to be established is recommendation 2.3; application of retail lease tribunal is recommendation 2.3; consideration of matters by retail lease tribunal is recommendation 2.3; and action where recourse to Retail Lease Tribunal has not resolved dispute is recommendation 2.3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I read through that because it does illustrate a point we made earlier in this debate; that is, the recommendations that the opposition is moving to strengthen the provisions of the Retail Act that we are dealing with tonight are direct lifts from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> report brought down under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), with the support of the honourable member for Cowan, both of whom voted against that during the course of tonight's discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations in section 2 on retail tenancy have been completely skirted by the government; not one piece of legislation has come forward from the government in respect  of this. The government is claiming that constitutionally this is not possible. We vehemently disagree that this is not possible and we believe that a uniform retail tenancy code developed at the national level gets over many of the problems of inconsistencies at the state level. It is going to be there and we have said that it is a proposal which, in our view and in the view of the committee that reported&mdash;but we have seen tonight already that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quite a number of those committee members have walked away from the recommendations that they signed up to before&mdash;will certainly help small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman), who is at the table, is shaking his head. Think back to that meeting in Newcastle. Most of the people there were retail tenants. There are stories of misery contained in the fair trading inquiry report about retailers having to battle major shopping centre owners and operators to get a fair deal, a fair go that the government keeps talking about. We believe that is possible through the amendments that we are proposing tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite obviously, we find it extraordinary that the government cannot see that this is a possibility. Again, why is it that the Reid committee made recommendations about retail tenancy issues, about putting retail lease tribunals in place, giving good cheap access to justice, and now they are walking away from all of them? It is a real question that needs to be asked. I am sure those on the other side who served on this committee will probably be looking at themselves in the mirror tonight or tomorrow and asking themselves the same question. If they do not, when they get back to their constituencies I am sure the small business community will, by the time we get through telling them all about what you have voted on. This report, as I have said, we adopt in full. The government were supposed to do that and they have squibbed it. I would like to know why they squibbed this most important element of the committee report.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must first respond to the comments the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) made early this evening and I would point out to him just a couple of little things. The first thing is that I did not spend hours berating the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) about what he had done in the last 13 years; he did that to us. I think his record in that context does not stand scrutiny. Secondly, the member for Paterson failed to mention the fact that I was actually a member of the Beddall 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11967"> committee. I actually went to most of the hearings then, too, as on this one. He also failed to admit, accept or concede publicly that he attended one hearing, simply because it was a meeting in Canberra. He did not come to any of the hearings around Australia; he took very little evidence; he signed up to the report and is now walking away from it. The fact is that he has been asked by business people in Newcastle to cross the floor on this issue. He has chosen not to, and he should explain that to his community and to his business people because they expected better of him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first dot point in the terms of reference in this inquiry states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the major business conduct issues arising out of commercial dealings between firms including, but not limited to, franchising and retail tenancy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Retail tenancy is up there in lights as part of this inquiry. It is without doubt the most difficult area in small business trading around the country and it was also the subject of the majority of submissions. As a local member, as I am sure my colleagues on both sides of the parliament are, I am getting constant concerns coming forward from people who are in difficulty in retail tenancies. A lot of our time was spent on this aspect of the report; we put a lot of effort into trying to work through what we should do. We ended up with a set of recommendations for a national tenancy code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, if we cannot do this, why were we given the reference? Is the government so incompetent that it gave us a reference about retail tenancies, knowing that we could not legislate? Are we so badly advised by our secretariat and all those who made submissions to us that we spent an awful lot of our time and a lot of public resources on  retail tenancies, with a recommendation for a national code enshrined within the Trade Practices Act, only to be told by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) that we cannot do that? What is going on here? We have suddenly got a concocted report from a lawyer who says&mdash;and I gather the minister is saying this&mdash;we can do this only if it is about taxes. So he is somehow trying to run this line that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee recommendation was for a new tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What these amendments are about is adopting the recommendations of the committee for a national tenancy code enshrined within the Trade Practices Act. That is what it is about. It is simple; it is not a complex concept. It is legal, it is constitutional and it is desirable. For too long we have had competing states with confusing and conflicting legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just touch on one small issue: the rights of existing tenants, which is probably the single most important issue in shopping centres. We recommended that sitting tenants have rights, a right to renewal&mdash;not the right to leave, which is what the landlords say. What they were saying to the committee was that, once the lease runs out, that is it. So people plan their lives for three or five years and somehow they are supposed to recover all their costs and investments in that short time. This has never been the case before because there was always a thing called goodwill. The landlords now say there is no goodwill, simply a lease; and when it is finished, you have to assume you are going to go. We said no, we should assume there is a right to renew&mdash;a logical, natural, moral position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The South Australian parliament is legislating now to in fact enshrine such a right. Nowhere else in Australia is. So what we are suggesting is that we do not want this state versus state, bit by bit practice; we want a uniform single code, not simply in theory but backed up by the Trade Practices Act. If we cannot do it, why the reference? If we cannot do it, why did the chairman of the committee and the government majority have us spend all this time on it and why on earth did we recommend it? It just does not make any sense. Either the government is stupid or it is wrong now. I support the amendments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting these amendments, I think we have to place on record that the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology did indeed believe that the Commonwealth had powers to underpin a uniform retail tenancy code in the Trade Practices Act 1974. If we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11968"> go to recommendation 2.2 on page 26, and I will read it for completeness, we see that it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Minister request the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to approve the Uniform Retail Tenancy Code for underpinning in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade Practices Act 1974</EMPHASIS> , thus providing for the courts to take into account provisions of the Uniform Retail Tenancy Code in determining whether or not business conduct in the area of retail tenancy has been `unfair' and thus unlawful.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I acknowledge that the context of that recommendation is slightly different from the proposal that has been put forward tonight. But we have to remember that, in the response to the committee's report, the weakest part of the government's response was in the area of retail tenancy matters. The committee made the important recommendation that these issues be taken to the ministerial council. Paragraph 2.41 at page 27 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not see such underpinning as a substitute for quick, low cost resolution of individual disputes through State and Territory retail tenancy dispute resolution processes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We acknowledge that state and territory jurisdictions have a lot to do in this. Even this amendment, clause 131, `Saving of other laws and remedies', states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Part is not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of any law in force in a State or Territory.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The simple matter is that in the government's response to the fair trading report the federal government's position is left up in the air as to what should be contained in a uniform retail tenancy code. This is an attempt to ensure that the matters that were highlighted by the committee are included in a uniform retail tenancy code. The amendment covers most of those matters that were highlighted by the committee. So that is the issue that we see  tonight in the consideration of these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, there is the furphy that this cannot be done. There is the furphy that it can only be done and it involves some form of taxing powers, which is just one of those throwaway lines to camouflage what is not a proper debate of the issues at hand. The other thing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is that, regrettably, after all the work that was done by the committee and all the matters that were highlighted by the committee, the government's response was mute about the federal government's position on all the matters that were outlined. That is a disappointment, because the issues that were put to us by retail tenants were harrowing, and they continue to occur. As I mentioned in my second reading contribution to this bill, they continue to occur, whether it be through changes of retail tenancy mix or whether it be through changes to disturbance of trading because of redevelopment and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These matters are real. They affect small businesses from one end of Australia to the other. Consistent in what the committee was exposed to was that, no matter where we went, the stories were similar, the stories were very distressing and the effect that it had had on the people that were involved in these small businesses was real. This is an attempt by the opposition to put this uniform retail tenancy code forward so that it can give direction to where the federal government sees these matters going.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the final contribution tonight, regrettably, because of the time constraint that has been placed on us, I will just quickly reiterate what the purpose of these two amendments is. Firstly, Labor is attempting to introduce the uniform retail tenancy code utilising the Commonwealth's corporations power under section 51(xx) of the Australia constitution. Secondly, in relation to lease renewal or extension, the uniform retail tenancy code would require an independent market review jointly financed by both the leaser and the lessee. The code would include a pre-contract disclosure statement in line with recommendation 2.5 of the Reid report. Disclosures would include disturbance to trading, retail tenancy mix, consultation with merchant associations and a statement of outgoings. The code would be prospective and only apply to small businesses, not to anchor tenants. The code would provide for a step&hyphen;by&hyphen;step dispute resolution mechanism and also cover service stations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, the reasons we are doing this are that we maintain the Reid committee report 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11969"> did set some standards. We believe the Commonwealth has the power to do this. We believe it is important for retail tenants to understand that they are going to get some protection; they are going to know that when they are entering into lease arrangements with shopping centre owners those arrangements are going to be done in an atmosphere of fairness and equity. At the present time in many cases that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also believe that each of those proposals we have put forward here directly lifts from the Reid committee report and, therefore, I reiterate that we cannot understand why those members of the government that sat on this committee now have walked away from this and have let the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) simply abrogate any responsibility in respect of the matter. The reason I say this is that I know he is meeting with small business ministers from the states on Friday. I know that at that meeting he is going to put to them some heavies, as he has done to many small business organisations, saying, `Cop what we're putting up or you'll get nothing at all.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find that extraordinary when, in the light of evidence that was given to the Senate estimates committee on 12 November this year, a representative of the Office of Small Business indicated that there was absolutely no chance of their getting a uniform agreement on uniform retail tenancy laws across the states, that there has not been in the past and there will not be in the future. That is why a uniform retail tenancy code is necessary from the national level&mdash;a top&hyphen;down approach&mdash;and we are providing that opportunity again. Labor, as usual, is providing that opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the minister and many others on the other side have talked about `political smokescreens'. They have claimed that this is  a stunt, and all the rest of it. I again say to those opposite that this is not a stunt. Labor is genuinely trying to ensure that the fair trading legislation we are dealing with gives small business a fair go. Labor is attempting to keep honest those recommendations which came from the fair trading inquiry report, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which had the unanimous support of those committee members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has adopted that report. We cannot for the life of us understand why the government has decided not to do so&mdash;a government which constantly berates Labor for what it is purported not to have done in its term in office, a government which says that it is, after all, the high priest looking after the interests of small business. I think small business will be the judge of this. When they find out that members of the committee and the government itself have chosen not to support the recommendations which they have been looking for in the small business community they will be stunned. I commend our amendments to the House. I regret that we do not have longer to debate each and every one of them in the fine detail that I would like, but we certainly will do when the Senate considers these matters next year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this adjournment debate, I would like to talk about the work of United Way, an organisation which raises finances through voluntary payroll deductions to assist a number of charities in particular regions. Currently, there are nine separate United Way groups operating in Australia. I became interested in this organisation when, as president of the Labor Council of New South Wales, the then secretary, Michael Easson, invited me to take his place on the board of United Way in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The organisation distributes finances collected to over 20 charities on a twice&hyphen;yearly basis in the Sydney metropolitan area. The charities that receive assistance for specific projects range from: community outreach ministries, which give practical help in housing and the teaching of living skills to homeless youth and young people suffering from mental disabilities; the Riding for the Disabled Association, which provides therapeutic and recreational horse riding and related activities, including harness driving and vaulting, to people with disabilities; the Children's Leukemia and Cancer Foundation, which provides quality care and support for affected children and families as well as world&hyphen;class research to find cures and more effective treatments; the Infants Home at Ashfield, which provides early intervention programs for children aged six weeks to five years and their families&mdash;and the intervention programs include child abuse, crisis accommodation for mothers and children and a day stay program for issues relating to children under two years. These are just four worthy charities that are assisted. To give this parliament an idea of what United Way is about, I quote from a message from the chairman, Robert Sutton:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I invite you to join the United Way team and urge you to support this wonderful concept of `sharing and caring' in United Way's campaign to raise 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11971"> funds for a broad range of health and welfare agencies that operate in the Sydney region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The driving force of our organisation is volunteer effort and the success of fundraising campaigns have demonstrated how effective and worthwhile the United Way volunteer approach is in helping the less fortunate among us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">United Way operates on a large scale in many countries and I have been involved with the organisation in the United States and in Asia, seeing first hand the important contribution it can make through having employers and employees working together in a co&hyphen;operative and voluntary fashion towards the common goal of contributing to support local community needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Sydney we have made an important start with the support of a number of major organisations, and the many thousands of dollars distributed over the last five years to local human care groups is already making a difference. I am confident that United Way is destined to become one of the most important sources of funds to health and welfare agencies in the region.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">United Way of Sydney operates on the basis that, by March each year, charities are asked to submit applications for funding projects which focus on services in response to crises or a change in the circumstances for families, children or the aged, or a combination of these.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Highest priority will be given to applications that are from an approved beneficiary; are for the funding of a project, not the entire organisation; have a budget which clearly shows United Way funds supplementing other funds already being applied to the project; show that funding has a direct impact on the clients of the project; and are for a period of 12 months. Applications are then considered by a beneficiaries committee, which undertakes a formal review of each application and accompanying documentation that shows proof of compliance with United Way requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many calls on the generosity of our community due to the many problems facing our society&mdash;whether we are looking at drugs, homelessness, escalating crime, concerns for our safety, poverty and worries  about the care of our children and the elderly, just to name a few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many national organisations such as the Smith Family, the Salvation Army and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> St Vincent de Paul, who are all staffed by volunteers, and many smaller organisations, such as the Tuesday night club in my electorate of Greenway, which assists intellectually handicapped people. All of these organisations are deserving of our generous support. However, United Way seeks to top up charities that have already proved their worth to society but are still in need of additional equipment. People who agree to contribute a small amount each week through payroll deduction, as far as United Way Sydney is concerned, are assisting 20 charities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="11971"><TITLE>Essay Competition</TITLE>

With Australia being the sixth largest country in the world I think we have to set a good example to other smaller countries.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Crime is a subject that I think we as a nation really need to crack down on. Did you know that four out of every 100,000 people are murdered in Australia. The situation is further complicated because more and more tourists are coming to Australia all the time which means that there is more people in Australia resulting in more murders. This shows why tourists are afraid to come to Australia because of these facts. Capital punishment should be returned to the penalty list for people who commit

If this is done there will be less unemployment because of new facilities being opened therefore leaving many vacancies in job positions. When these facilities are opened people from far and wide will hear about the wonderful activities and accommodation in Australia and will come to see for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">POLLUTION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pollution is the bad side of our wonderful country. It destroys the country's natural physique and ruins its beauty. Another bad thing about pollution is that tourists hate it and return to their own countries with bad health reports. With the government investing money into the big businesses that cause the pollution and not investing much money into stopping pollution it makes bringing in more money for other things like tourism very hard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To conclude I would like to say that Australia is a beautiful place and the three things we need to focus on to make it even better are crime, tourism and pollution. So just keep these subjects in mind and maybe even carry them out and we can make our nation BETTER!</PARA>

Recycling is a great idea, the more we recycle the less trees that have to be cut down. Another idea is to plant trees where forests once existed. This would need to be done each time a tree is cut down to be effective.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It saddens me to speak of the stolen children, but with the current division produced by the ridiculous notion that native title has validity it is a subject that must be raised. I speak of course of the thousands who, from the turn of the century until the 1960s, were taken from their parents and forced to travel great distances where they found themselves living in the company of strangers. Evidence shows that some suffered sadistic treatment and sexual abuse&mdash;horrors that can never be excused. Many of the records have been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11973"> destroyed and very few of these innocent children were ever reunited with their relatives. Indeed, it was a dark period in our young nation's past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may surprise the House to know that I do not speak of Aboriginal children but of the estimated 40,000 children transported to Australia by various British charities. The story of the stolen British children parallels that of the stolen Aboriginal children. It all happened around the same time and many of the reasons for separation from families were similar. The justification will always be a source of argument and, of course, in both cases there were reports of terrible ill-treatment. In perspective, there were approximately 150,000 stolen British children. Not only did those sent to Australia apparently outnumber their Aboriginal counterparts but it seems that, with very few exceptions, they did not return home or experience any family reunion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could argue at length the differences between what was suffered by each group and the rights and wrongs of separation, but that serves no purpose. The point is that the stolen British children sent to Australia and indeed the removal of children from the slums of Melbourne in the early part of the century put more into context the equality of suffering. I do not wish to attempt to justify what happened to the Aboriginal people. Rather, the point is that they do not have a monopoly on suffering, and history clearly shows that to be the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Noel Pearson was reported recently as declaring war on white Australia, all Australians should have realised the war started long ago when Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal activists began their unconscionable public relations exercise aimed at raising the level of guilt in white Australia. In this PR war, truth was the first casualty, for truth would not serve the purpose of the strategic attack on the emotions and conscience of ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The young in particular have fallen foul of this outrageously deceitful exercise aimed at  bringing us to the point where we are about to give perhaps as much as 80 per cent of our country to about two per cent of our popula 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion&mdash;all in the name of compensation and to free ourselves of the guilt so carefully cultivated and effectively massaged into our minds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt many Aborigines are disadvantaged, but there equally is no doubt they are not on their own in their suffering either now or in the past. There are plenty of examples of, as I said before, equality of suffering, but this PR machine of guilt assaults us with indecent comment not balanced by the surrounding circumstances of history. The stolen children report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>, was just one of the more recent examples designed to make us guilty about the past. It was sad. It was terrible and individual stories tugged at the hearts of Australians everywhere&mdash;myself included. But it was as if these awful privations were solely owned and experienced by Aborigines. Of course, that is a lie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the report's purpose was guilt, it served well and its timing was impeccable. We cannot turn back the hands of time, and no amount of compensation will ever change what happened. We will never have true reconciliation until we rid our society of divisive policies clearly based on race alone. We must also rid ourselves of those who financially feed off the exercise of misleading both the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people of Australia. Equality for all Australians is the only path to a cohesive future as one nation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="11973"><TITLE>Burma</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to welcome the recent announcement by the United States oil giant Texaco of its intention to pull out of operations in Burma. I too share the view displayed by the company's shareholders and the free&hyphen;thinking Burmese people that this decision is a victory for democracy. The human rights abuses which the SLORC has perpetuated against the nation of 45 million people is well documented. It has been raised in the House by numerous other speakers. I am pleased the message from Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy is being received by the governments of democratic nations and, more importantly, by multinational corporations 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11974"> whose operations prop up and preserve the power of the SLORC and its generals in Burma.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to quote the Reverend Paarlberg, a leader of the Reformed Church of America, an organisation that has been very vocal in its opposition to companies which have a history of doing business with companies which display a poor record in the area of basic human rights. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Texaco's decision is a tremendous victory for the Burmese people. It sends a clear message to Burma's military dictatorship that there will be no Business As Usual, until democracy returns.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We know that multinational oil company investment provides the largest legal source of currency to the regime. We also know that this particular industry relies heavily in its early developmental stages on a substantial labour force. It is this recruitment of labour and the methods used by the SLORC which have led Amnesty International to report that what particularly distinguished the Burmese junta from other modern tyrannies was its use of slave labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should remind investors in oil companies which participate in these projects that the money derived from such ventures, constructed on the bones of Burmese men, women, and children, cannot be justified as contributing to the wealth of the country. I hope the decision taken by Texaco will increase the pressure on other companies to seriously consider their continued operations in Burma. It has been reported that there is a growing protest in some states of America against companies doing business with the SLORC. Businesses have been urged to restrict trade with the military junta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Texaco's decision has been welcomed by the wider community, the decision by Premier Oil of Britain to buy Texaco shares in the Yetagun project still does not resolve the issue of foreign investment. A spokesperson for the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We welcome Texaco's gesture and we appeal to Premier to seriously reconsider their deal with Burma's illegitimate regime. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe it is against the current trend of the UK Government's Burma policy and the position of Aung San Suu Kyi who advocates no foreign investment with SLORC.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The United Kingdom government is following the line adopted by the United States. The United Kingdom foreign minister said that his government would discourage economic activity in Burma and would urge companies considering doing business in that country to think about their human rights record and listen to the government's advice before making a decision about whether or not to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July, the Burton Group and Polo Ralph Lauren became the latest groups to pull out of Burma. The Burton Group issued a statement that it had instructed its suppliers to place no further contracts for sourcing from Burma and to terminate all existing contracts by the end of the year. In its statement the company said that it is the Burton Group's policy to listen to its customers and this decision has been taken following a review of customer opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the House acknowledge the firm stand taken by the United States President, Bill Clinton, and leaders of some European countries. However, we should also welcome the initiative taken by our Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Mr Alexander Downer, to further investigate the impact of investment in Burma by Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr John Dauth, was recently sent to Rangoon as a special envoy in an effort to seek practical ways to bring about democracy and a greater respect for human rights in the country. Mr Dauth passed on the message to Burma's foreign minister that Australia was looking to them to make tangible progress towards democratic institutions and the better observance of human rights. He also urged the SLORC to seriously consider dialogue with the National League for Democracy and its leaders. I note from an article in this week's national media that already the SLORC has opened up a crack in the wall and invited communication with the NLD&mdash;a move which has been welcomed by many nations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11975">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit allowed Mr Dauth to raise the Australian government's concerns about the human rights situation in Burma directly with the key players. It is important to note that throughout this process Australia has remained in touch with Aung San Suu Kyi and will continue to consult with her about our Burma policy. I applaud the minister for taking this initiative and his efforts to keep open the channels of communication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is vital that we in Australia continue our support for the people of Burma in their fight to restore democracy to the country. I hope Australian businesses will take a good look at the human rights record of the country before committing their resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, let me quote a journalist from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> who is well acquainted with the country. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any initiative to try to force change in Burma is welcome. However we should not forget the grim realities of Burma. We should not overlook the thousands of innocent men, women and children who suffer and die at the hands of military thugs each year or those dying from disease in the border camps. And we should not forget those who legitimise the peddlers of this misery also have blood on their hands.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to draw to the attention of the House one of the worst examples of cynical political conduct that I have come across in recent years, where a member of this House has sought to prey upon the elderly and the lonely for reasons of cynical personal political exploitation. This is contained in a memorandum which has been sent to his colleagues by the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). The member for Cowan is well known in this House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on a very important principle of international environmental law in its application to the development at Port Hinchinbrook. This principle is a precautionary principle and it is concerned specifi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11976"> cally with the risk to the environment brought about by human activity. It operates so that, where the probability of the occurrence of the event and its likely consequences are uncertain, measures taken to avert the possibilities involved with such events are necessarily precautionary. It is a principle which has received increasing acceptance at international levels since its conception in the 1970s and it was recognised as `a statement of commonsense' in a 1993 decision of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my opinion that this principle should be applied to the activities that are being carried out at Port Hinchinbrook. It should be applied in order to effect an immediate cessation of the development, pending an assessment of the environmental degradation that has occurred at that site. This call comes as a response to what appear to be repeated and flagrant breaches of the deed of agreement pursuant to which the development of Port Hinchinbrook was to go ahead, breaches that local residents have claimed include unapproved acid sulfate soil excavation, failure to treat acid sulfate soil, discharge of acids and excavated materials into the sea and into the melaleuca forests, muddy run&hyphen;off causing plumes stretching three kilometres over seagrass beds, creation and operation of dredge spoil ponds without proper standards of engineering or approval, dredging of the marina basin without an appropriate licence, and the wholesale and unapproved destruction of mangroves. Nor was there a Commonwealth approved environmental management plan, acid sulfate management plan or turbidity control plan in place, or an independent monitor appointed before the site works were begun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The development at Port Hinchinbrook is now larger than the development consented to by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill). What started with a restricted resort including a marina basin now incorporates a harbour and an artificial beach stretching for one kilometre, resplendent with coconut palms. A third excavation site is currently under way. These additions have commenced without approval.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is perhaps the dredge spoil ponds containing excavated acid sulfate soils and discharge which are the main source of concern. The walls of the dredge spoil ponds on the southern site were crudely constructed, and the ponds themselves were built across a natural freshwater catchment. The ponds are filled with a sulfuric acid solution, despite the fact that this catchment feeds a melaleuca forest. In addition, pipes exist across and through the walls, draining the build&hyphen;up of water that threatens to collapse the walls into the adjacent melaleuca forest. This melaleuca forest is classified `unallocated state land' which has been environmentally designated as the critical habitat of the endangered mahogany glider and an ecosystem of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The developer at Port Hinchinbrook relies on dilution and on the buffering capacity of seawater to raise the pH level to neutral. However, buffering changes the chemistry in ways that are harmful to marine life, and allows the metals and organics content of the sulfuric acid to precipitate out onto the fine clay particles which are then borne to the Great Barrier Reef, from where the metals enter the food chain. Breaches for this month are staggering: the destruction of mangroves; the dumping and spreading of sand on the foreshore at Oyster Point, effectively suffocating the mangrove replanting area; repeated long&hyphen;term turbidity plumes arising from the development, streaming off Oyster Point on the outgoing tide and being carried over world heritage beds; and dredging right through world heritage seagrasses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no comprehensive assessment of Port Hinchinbrook and its environmental impacts. I am yet to see or hear of a report suggesting that the development should go ahead. I have, however, received a plethora of material which more than suggests that this development should be stopped immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is incumbent on this generation to err on the side of caution when it comes to developments such as that at Port Hinchinbrook. This is because environmental impacts do not respect borders. The development at Port Hinchinbrook is destroying the environmental status quo on the edge of a world heritage 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11977"> area. While we are witnessing the devastating effects the development is currently having on the environment, no&hyphen;one can speak with certainty of the long&hyphen;term and potentially irreversible effects of this continuing development. Let us place the onus on the developer to show why, in light of all the contradictory evidence, his development should go ahead. But let us do it now, before it is far too late.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth employment: a working solution</EMPHASIS> . I also take the opportunity to congratulate the committee Chairman, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), committee members and the secretariat&mdash;in particular, James Rees, Paul McMahon and Gaye Milner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally speaking, the committee reached agreement in a bipartisan way on the first four chapters, but that was simply not possible in chapter 5, on youth wages, where opposition members could not agree in any way with the recommendations made by the government members, and one member of the committee, the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), wrote a minority report. This was because, in essence, the government members, whether they realised it or not, recommended that Australia go down the income inequality direction so prevalent in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently read an article where the mayor of Chicago was reported as saying that his city was in the midst of an employment boom&mdash;$6 an hour, and you could get a job anywhere. If that is a boom, God help us all. A couple of years ago, I was in Denver and, in the mall, a very polite young man came up to me and asked me for the price of a hamburger and a cup of coffee. Just on the corner, there was a sign that said: Work available. I said, `Why don't you go and get a job?' He took me around to where there was a stall selling all sorts of things, and it was $2.70 an hour. In that sort of context, of course, employment becomes a bit of a joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth employment opportunities bedevil the developed world, and Australia is no exception. Governments that fail to lead in the employment debate for young people will be judged harshly by history. In recent weeks, Channel 9 and News Limited promoted a commendable jobs for Australia campaign, securing promises from employers for 20,000 jobs. However, the stark reality is that those 20,000 jobs, if they eventuate, would do nothing, absolutely nothing of a fundamental nature, to change the chronic and endemic unemployment that stagnates the economies of Australia and the developed world. For me, that campaign reinforced the fact that the jobs are simply not there, not only for younger but, indeed, for older workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This inquiry focused on young people aged from 15 to 24 years of age. In this brief speech to the Main Committee I wish to address three points which, for me, are the substance of the report. The first refers to the age group five to 15. This is the age where children gain literacy, numeracy and the often forgotten social and technological skills. Although there are privileged and vested interest in the education sector denying that there is a crisis in our primary and junior secondary schools, there is no escaping the fact that when Australia is compared to other 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11981"> OECD countries we are nearly at the bottom when it comes to expenditure on the age group of five to 15. There are severe consequences for this failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are unacceptable literacy rates. Arguments about whether it is 33 per cent, 25 per cent or even 20 per cent are irrelevant. When you look at the figures over the last 20 years, probably the aggregate data has not changed much. But what has changed is that the top 20 per cent of our students are streaking away from the average, and the bottom 20 per cent, or 25 or 30 per cent&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;are being abandoned. This is a significant problem and it will not go away. No matter how many times the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) denies it, it is a problem that has resource implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an increase in the alienation and the isolation of youth. Additional problems for young people seeking employment were often mentioned in the public hearings. Analysed further, they always meant lack of success, lack of confidence, lack of security and lack of love. This is a problem and it will not go away. It needs to be addressed when children are young and it is just as important as the literacy debate. At the extreme end of this alienation, insecurity and isolation is Australia's alarming youth suicide rate. This is this nation's shame. It also will not go away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The actual resources allocated that directly go to the benefit of children are a national shame. Minister Kemp is correct to describe literacy at crisis levels in Australia, but he is completely wrong and, in fact, somewhat dishonest in refusing to acknowledge the resource implications. He and his Orwell&hyphen;like responses on education expenditure will, as certainly as night follows day, have their day of reckoning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I wish to raise concerns what I refer to as the training period of young people from 15 to 20 years of age. The report clearly found that career guidance for young people in secondary schools is almost non&hyphen;existent. The person chosen as the careers guidance officer was more often than not chosen by that famous method&mdash;the short straw method. Who in their right mind would volunteer for that position and be responsible for giving counselling to more than 1,000 students?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been in education for most of my life. It was always illuminating in a most ironic way that people in education described as bright were, in practical terms, not so bright, and often people who were described as not so bright, in practical terms got the best results. There is a lot of ego, a lot of snobbery and a lot of false praise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other main factor affecting careers guidance was the superficial, irregular and, at times, non&hyphen;existent relationship that existed between secondary schools, training providers&mdash;including TAFE and employers&mdash;and employer organisations. In that context, training and preparation and opportunity for entry level jobs are limited far more than they ought to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point I wish to make is aimed directly at state and federal governments of all persuasions in their failure to provide leadership and employment opportunities for young people. Public job creation is relatively efficient. It is socially productive, since it provides younger workers at that very crucial first entry level with much needed job experience. The federal and state public services, public works programs and state utilities in power and water, for example, can provide positions in traineeships, apprenticeships and entry level jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the employment of young people is concerned, government's record in this country in recent years is just appalling. It is in fact even lower than the record of the private sector, which in itself is also appallingly low. I wonder how many people in this House realise that the percentage of young people in public employment is 0.6 per cent. This is how we care 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11982"> for young people in this country and how we provide opportunities&mdash;0.6 per cent. It is a damned shame and a disgrace. The private sector percentage is 2.6 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You did not listen to what I said. Public employment is very efficient and socially productive&mdash;and we should not forget that point. The implementation of policies for public job creation and private sector subsidies can be done fairly quickly, and if it is designed to avoid an unproductive substitution of subsidised for unsubsidised workers it can promote the much needed impetus our young people need with employment opportunities&mdash;that confidence, that security, that first step.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the current climate, it needs to be understood that the jobs are simply not there. If governments refuse to provide the lead, why would the private sector? The private sector does not have the same responsibility for families and for workers that governments do. Why should they? But the federal government does have responsibilities, and if it fails to meet them it will suffer its fate at the hands of the wider electorate. Just look around the world at how national governments have been lasting one term; look at what happened in Portugal and in France.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will see. What about the future? In their book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The </EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Judas Economy</EMPHASIS> , published this year, William Wolman and Anne Colamosca pointed out that people in the developed world earning their living from work are in a race without the finishing line. They live in an economy where their standard of living stagnates, where their job security is continually threatened and, since the end of the Cold War, where they have found no peace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst corporate profitability has reached unprecedented levels, wage gains are meagre. Wolman and Colamosca point out that the triumph of capital has tilted the playing field against those who earn their living from work throughout the industrialised world. Blue&hyphen;collar workers copped it in the 1980s. White&hyphen;collar workers are copping it now in the 1990s, and it will not let up. Elite workers such as doctors, lawyers and accountants are next, and they will be forced to compete with the hundreds of thousands of graduates from the developing world who will be competing, at a fraction of the cost, with our own graduates, in an increasingly technological world and a global economy that ignores the boundaries of nation states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like a cyclone, capitalism is changing the political and economic structures of all countries, developed and developing. The market is now god. The market has no conscience whatsoever and economic planning is becoming the devil incarnate. Free market ideology has finally claimed a total victory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not something to laugh about; this is a serious matter. Since capitalism first emerged in Holland, some 400 years ago, it has always been challenged. It is not being challenged now. Since the end of the Cold War, the market has run roughshod over ordinary citizens in the developed world and nowhere has that impact been felt greater than by our young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I say the following. Firstly, as the Channel 9 campaign for jobs clearly demonstrated, the jobs are simply not there. Secondly, when it comes to expenditure on the five&hyphen; to 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;old age group in Australia, we must appreciate and recognise that we have one of the lowest expenditures in the developed world and that particular fact will lead, and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11983"> is leading, to dire consequences. Thirdly, when the 15&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;old training age group are considered, we learn in the inquiry report that the relationships between training providers, employers and schools&mdash;that trinity&mdash;ought to work closely together. What do we find? We find that it is nothing but superficial. There are splendid exceptions to that but, in the main, they are superficial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We find that the guidance career officers chosen by the short straw method have totally unrealistic expectations of being responsible in some cases for up to 1,200 students. Could any of us imagine what it must be like to be that person in a secondary school and have that responsibility? It is just damned impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments&mdash;all governments of all persuasions, both state and federal&mdash;are a very poor role model for entry level positions for young people, providing just 0.6 per cent of employees, whilst the private sector provides 2.6 per cent, an appallingly low figure as well, and not a good investment in our future and in our national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, we should take cognisance of the future of work in a global economy with the market running supreme and roughshod over people's jobs, aspirations and security. We have seen blue&hyphen;collar workers cop it. We are now seeing white&hyphen;collar workers cop it. I do not think many of us realise that our elite workers and many of those ambitious young people who are in our universities&mdash;coming out as accountants, doctors, dentists and so on&mdash;are going to be competing with graduates from the developing world who will offer, through technological means, their labour at a fraction of the cost. Already, in Bangalore in India many of the financial services that are required in the United States are supplied nine hours ahead of time in India at a great loss of jobs in the United States. This will affect every country in the developed world and it is something that we should take cognisance of. I look forward to the government's response. I commend the report and its uncomfortable implications to this House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training was very important and one that I was very pleased to be part of. It took us all over Australia, as I am sure has been mentioned before. Most importantly, it took us into the schools, something that has not happened as much as it should have in previous inquiries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time that I am aware of, young people in the school system were sat down in groups and we sat with them, asking questions and getting direct feedback from them&mdash;not from the teachers, the careers advisers or the peak bodies, but from the students themselves&mdash;about the challenges that they faced, about the problems that they had, and about the perceptions that they felt the job market had about them. That feedback raised some very interesting points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to talk today about the individuals that we met, the schooling system and the job market itself. I also wish to talk about something which has been left out of the report altogether, and that is the indigenous population, and about some of the evidence we heard from individuals dealing with that sector of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, whenever you talk to any employer about youth employment or unemployment, one of the first things that comes up is attitudes. But what I found very interesting was that, when we talked to both employers and young people, there was an interesting mix of views about how they were perceived. It is very much determined by the business person's experience and their lack or otherwise of ability in dealing with the job market. I found that many business 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11984"> people show that they really do not have the skills, the knowledge, the time or the patience with which to work with any potential employee, let alone young employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was quite often a stereotyping of young people as those who do not want to work and whom the world owes a living. And yes, there is certainly a percentage of that type, and we all acknowledge it. But there is also a large number of young people out there who really do want to work. The problem is whether they are being equipped for the job market. Quite simply put, in many areas of Australia they are not. The fact is that the first job I had was pumping petrol. You cannot pump petrol today as a job, because everybody does it themselves. And so many other entry&hyphen;level jobs, particularly in the banking sector, have disappeared altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These were the sorts of jobs that got people their start. They may not have stayed in them very long, but they showed them their rights and responsibilities in the job market. With that work now having disappeared, they are finding out whether the school system has moved along with the job market to provide the students with the skills that they need to first enter the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To answer that question, in my own electorate of Longman we sat down with a number of students from Caboolture, Bribie Island, Tullawong, Morayfield and one of the private schools, St Columban's. We asked them about their expectations when it came to numeracy and literacy, and this was at a time when that was very much in the news. To be quite frank, the group that we were with were the higher echelons of the school. They were the better performers from all of these schools, and most of them had the expectation of going on to university. I thought that they would be quite affronted by the view that perhaps their numeracy and literacy skills were not up to scratch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What absolutely astounded me was when the questions were put to this group, `How many of you would feel comfortable in front of an employer with writing an essay of 500 words or whatever else?' and `How do you believe your literacy would stack up?' the overwhelming majority of these good students felt uncomfortable with their level of skills. The sort of reply we heard was from one young man who was very good at calculus and one of the other higher maths, for which I cannot even think of the term right now. He said that he goes with his dad on the milk run and, when someone gives him a $50 note, he is embarrassed because he has to get his calculator out to give them change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That really is where we are at. When people start in the workplace, 70 per cent do not go on to university: they start at a lower level, and they must have those basic skills. Have we neglected them? I certainly think that we have. As was mentioned previously by the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) it starts at primary school: it does not start in years 10, 11 and 12. We must build this up all the way through. I commend the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) for his approach to numeracy and literacy, but we do need to have resources there. It is absolutely critical that not only do we talk about the need but that resources are provided. And that is something that I intend to push very hard for, in whatever time I have in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then went on to talk about attitudes&mdash;the big bugbear, the one that we see on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> and on all of the other news&hyphen;making programs; I do not say that they `report' the news; they make the news, quite often. The fact is that those students get very annoyed with their own peers: the ones that sit and do nothing and give the rest of them a bad name, or the one 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11985"> that turns up for a job, only stays for half a day and brings his mates in. That makes it difficult for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was no different for me when I was in the army in a green uniform in Townsville. If someone did something wrong, you were all seen as the same, because you were all easily branded as `the army'. It is the same for young people: it only needs one, two or half&hyphen;a&hyphen;dozen such people in any district, and that can debase the entire youth population. There are many young people doing fine jobs and getting on with their lives, but we have to start looking at how we can best assist them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area of the individual concerns expectations and here is where the parents come in. It seems to me&mdash;and I keep relating back to my own experiences because I think that is one of the best ways to build on where you are&mdash;that in the army when I first joined, the best of the best went not to the officer training school but to the apprenticeship school at Balcombe. You had to be really the elite of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what we find now is that young people are staying at school until year 12. They were going to the apprenticeship schools at 15 and 16; they now cannot go until 17 at the earliest. Their expectations, after having completed senior, move away from being an apprentice and into going on to university. Perhaps this is going to do something better for them and, in some cases, it will, but it is horses for courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We find apprenticeships are at a 30&hyphen;year low. There are a lot of reasons for that, but one is the expectation of the parents that if the young person stays on to year 12, the only chance they have is if they get a university degree and the young person has the same view. At Bribie Island&mdash;again, one of the schools in my electorate&mdash;it was reinforced by every student that the school pushed them into an academic line and that if you did not see a future for yourself in academia, then you really did not have a future. That is really quite damaging for any young person because only 30 per cent of our population will go to university. What happens to the other 70 per cent of those students?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The schools I refer to have a very good record and exceed that 30 per cent average quite considerably. They do a very good job, but we have to start to look at the expectations parents, workers and employers have for young people entering the market. What skill level do they have? What can they contribute to the business and what can the business give to them? Quite often, we found that the business people who were interviewed and gave evidence really had an unrealistic expectation of what young people could do for their businesses. It has to be a two&hyphen;way street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I want quickly to speak about something that I first saw in the electorate of the member for Port Adelaide and that is a school with the skilled industry links program. I must say it dramatically changed my attitudes towards what can be achieved. They had a principal who could see that he had a low socioeconomic area with high unemployment and was very single-minded in how he was going to address it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Startling results were achieved when he introduced a program where students went to work in a normal workplace one day a week and remained at school the other four days. In 1995 the school had I think it was 55 per cent of the senior class going on to higher education, training or a job and, one year later, 95 per cent achieved that. That is a remarkable turnaround because the job market did not improve.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K6">Mr BROUGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Peter Turner is the man and he must be commended. We have started exactly the same thing in my own area and I want to give you an example of what it has done to the business community. We have involved people who had had very little to do with charitable organisations or the young, but who have been employers, with this skilled industry links program which has been funded by the federal government. Because of the attitude of the people on the ground, we have seen business working with these young people and the schools and in the very first week, young people have got traineeships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were young people who would have perhaps gone into their first job after finishing school and, not understanding their rights and responsibilities and what exactly a workplace is about, would have blown it. But the employer had no qualms about bringing these persons in. He was helping them and he realised that this young person had the right attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw another example this week when one of the key people who is being involved in this did not have the young person in the scheme&mdash;the young person was working in another business&mdash;but he was so impressed with him that he put him on in his own business. It is starting to change their attitude because they are starting to work with the young people, rather than constantly looking at them as something to be despised. That is what we have got to work towards. I think that the federal and state governments have to put more time, energy and money into that sphere, as much as we do into further education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other areas of great concern to me was the way that young people expressed a great lack of knowledge of the TAFE system. The TAFE system was seen as being the third worst option. If you could not get into university and you could not get a job and all else failed, you went to TAFE. That simply is not the case. TAFE has to be sold better. It has to show people in the schools and the business community that if you have a diploma or you have a course under your belt from TAFE, it is worth its weight in gold. If we can do that, we can change the young persons' attitudes and open their minds up to different spheres which they can explore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Traineeships and apprenticeships were not as equally poorly understood, but they certainly were not understood in the way they should be. When I finished school, people looked to go to apprenticeships. Today they seem like a third&hyphen;best or second&hyphen;best option. As was previously mentioned, we must have real career guidance. It is not good enough simply to say that, `If you do this course, you can do that at university.' We have to start to get down to the students and explain what options are available to them, what is going to best suit them, what is going to give them the best chance in life, and open their minds to TAFE, to apprenticeships, to traineeships, to university&mdash;the gamut of everything that is available&mdash;and not be selective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we can do that, we will go some way to filling the jobs that are there. As has rightly been pointed out, there are not enough jobs. I do not run away from that. This government and the previous government&mdash;and I am sure every other government&mdash;do in their own way what they feel is best to create more jobs for Australia. But the sad reality is that there are still many jobs there that are not being filled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just through the Queensland outback, in Roma we heard of apprenticeships and traineeships which could not be filled. At the inquiry was the first time I had heard that, and I must say I thought I had heard incorrectly&mdash;not being able to fill apprenticeships and traineeships just mind&hyphen;boggled me. We went on to Longreach where there is a pastoral college. We were told in evidence that each year they have 200&hyphen;plus jobs and yet they could only get 30 to 40 students there.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11987">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not going to fill every job, but these jobs are going missing. Is it because it is so comfortable on the coast? Is it because it is such a harder lifestyle in the bush? Whatever the reasons, we must look at them and try and fill every job that is there. We were also told that over 1,000 chef apprenticeships have gone missing and Mount Isa Mines told us that they only filled half of their apprenticeships last year. Those things concern me greatly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must have some sort of database whereby the location of the jobs and the likely shortfalls in the future as technology changes are fed into the schooling system, TAFE and universities so we fill those positions. That is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last couple of minutes that I have available to me, I want to touch on our indigenous population. As I said, this was not brought up in the report but we received evidence on it. In Mount Isa, the most disturbing thing that I heard was from a clergyman who is also a principal of a boarding school. He spoke about the term we often hear, `sit&hyphen;down money'. When asked to expand on this, he said, `We have young indigenous people that are at school. When they turn 16 and are eligible for unemployment benefits, their parents actually ask them to come out of the system to earn sit&hyphen;down money.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to start to understand and appreciate the culture which surrounds indigenous Australians. The fact is that, if you are able to participate, particularly in these remote areas, in your cultural and ceremonial activities as part of the larger family group and put enough money or resources into that group to sustain it, then you have a lifestyle which is okay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advocating that all Australians should be required to remain at school and, whilst they are at school, things such as family payments are only made if young people of all ethnic backgrounds attain a level of 85&hyphen;plus per cent in school. The first thing that we acknowledge is that young indigenous Australians are not completing year 12. We know for a fact that, if you do not complete year 12, the less chance you have of success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to start looking more seriously at this incredibly difficult problem so that the indigenous population of Australia can enjoy as many as possible of the opportunities that this great nation has. It has been a great opportunity for me to participate in this inquiry. I recommend many of its recommendations to the government. I hope that all governments of all persuasions in the future will look to them seriously to address this most difficult problem of youth unemployment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth employment: a working solution</EMPHASIS> , can I say that the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into issues relating to the employment of young people was very appropriate in view of the community's concerns about the high rate of youth unemployment. The issues looked at by the committee such as literacy and numeracy, vocational training, and school to work programs, have all been considered in previous reports to the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it was important for this current committee to revisit those issues. I also believe that the preparedness of committee members to give up valuable time in their electorates and travel to regional parts of Australia to listen to the views of young people, the community and employers, enabled the committee to produce a report based on the needs of all concerned. I was delighted that one of the school forums was held in my electorate of Greenway. I thank students from Blacktown Boys High, Blacktown Girls High, Evans High, John Paul II Senior High and Quakers Hill High for their participation.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11988"></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MK6">Mr MOSSFIELD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very good. It was at this forum that the point that the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) made relating to the shortage of career advisers certainly came through. At one of the schools it was said that there was only one career adviser for about 900 students, and I will refer to that issue later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the committee's main focus should be on recommendations that enable the education system to provide to industry better qualified and more productive employees than is currently the case. We should remember that, due to the increased retention rates, young people are now leaving school at 17 and 18, where, say, 15 years ago, a large number were leaving school at 15 and 16, with the school certificate, and entering either an apprenticeship or a clerical occupation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While some employers did express concern about the cost of employing young people, it was mainly in the terms of young people not having the skills and experience to perform the duties expected of them rather than the wages being too high. I believe the issue of wages and conditions should be left to the industrial parties. It is important that industry attracts high academic achievers into the trade areas by maintaining competitive wage rates. For these reasons, I strongly oppose a number of the committee's recommendations relating to industrial relations issues which reduce the income of young workers. There were, however, a number of the committee's recommendations that, if implemented, will improve the employability of young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that Professor Sweet, from the Dusseldorf Skills Forum, correctly addressed the issue of the cost of training young people when he addressed the committee in June. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the big costs that occurs in taking on an apprentice, which is often not recognised clearly enough, is not so much the cost of the wage or the on costs, it is the cost of supervision time in that first year of the apprenticeship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once they get over the hump of the first year, the supervision costs decline significantly. It seems to me a sensible way of addressing that issue is by ensuring one way or another that young people are made productive at the point when they hit the actual apprenticeship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that is a good argument in favour of the sorts of vocational education courses in years 11 &amp; 12 that link into apprenticeships and give kids the basic foundation skills that they need to work on site&mdash;occupational health and safety, quality standards, use of tools and so on&mdash;at the point when they hit the point of formal indentures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">While many schools are extending their school to work programs and vocational courses, the committee was of the view that improvement in these areas needed to be more comprehensive and broad ranging. The committee was advised that a number of schools had introduced a school to work program based on the TRAC model. Students in the TRAC program receive dual accreditation through the state education system, with the higher school certificate, and through industry bodies recognising the credentials that are received in training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TRAC program offers curriculum in four main industry areas&mdash;hospitality, retail, office and automotive. Students attend work placement with a minimum of four employers during their training. The work placement is highly valued and highly structured, and it forms a significant bridge between school and work. Supporters of the TRAC program claim that it is superior to school&hyphen;based vocational education because 70 per cent of the learning actually occurs in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was also made aware of the general shortage of qualified career advisers. Many people were working in this field with only school and university experience and little, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11989"> if any, experience in the general industry. I suggest that schools make use of the more senior experienced workers who have been forced out of the work force as career advisers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To highlight this point I will refer to an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 26 November 1997 entitled `BHP workers to be trained as teachers.' This goes to the core of what I am suggesting here. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than 30 workers facing retrenchment from BHP's Newcastle plant will be trained as teachers and guaranteed a job under an agreement struck between the company, the Department of School Education and the University of Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A memo of understanding was signed in Parliament yesterday to enrol 30 workers in a specially tailored program to retrain them as teachers in technology and applied sciences.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on it says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The company said yesterday the retraining system would allow the employees to continue working at the plant while studying part&hyphen;time for either a diploma or bachelor of education.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A BHP worker, Mr Bruce McGrath, said his decision to retrain as a teacher had come after first recovering from the shock of the announcement in April and then following "heavy discussion" with his family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"In the end I decided I did not want my skills to die and the best thing to do would be to pass them on to children though education," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Aquilina said NSW had a shortage of teachers in the fields of technology and applied science and could guarantee the workers a job when they graduated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">While not strictly referred to as career advisers, certainly there is great advantage in having experienced workers like those people being retrained and then coming into the school system. Hopefully, that might be something that will catch on over a period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will once again quote Professor Sweet, who I believe makes a great contribution in the field of vocational training. He said to the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We change our approach to career education and guidance from one which says it all has to be on the shoulders of an expert career adviser in the school to one that says it has got to involve much more strongly local employers and the local community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to thank the chairman of the committee, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), for his work in seeing that the committee had the resources to carry out its inquiry. I would also like to thank the secretariat for their support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see the document as an ongoing document. I will be referring to it and its recommendations and submissions in my future speeches in this parliament and in my electorate. To that extent, this is already happening. A number of members have already referred to aspects of the report in their submissions in the other chamber. In fact, I have referred to it myself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my submissions on legislation relating to the common youth allowance I probably drew on the point that the member for Longman (Mr Brough) was making. His point was that while there are clearly not enough jobs there, as the member for Port Adelaide has quite clearly said, on the other hand there are on many occasions jobs there that go unfilled due to a lack of matching.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my submissions on the common youth allowance I said that one way of overcoming youth unemployment, or certainly of reducing it, is for governments to research skill requirements for the future and then to fully finance four&hyphen;year apprenticeships in those particular skills using 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11990"> federal government departments, state government departments, and appropriate private industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again I support the remarks of the member for Port Adelaide who quite clearly pointed out that governments in particular, and now unfortunately to a lesser extent private industry, are simply not training our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my submissions I quoted further from the youth employment report. I said, relating to skill shortages:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite this background of high unemployment and substantial structural changes in the labour market, Australia continues to experience significant and in some cases severe skill shortages in some industries and occupations.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some submissions and presentations to the inquiry flagged prospective skill shortages in particular industries. The committee sought further information from industry associations about current and prospective skill shortages but did not obtain many responses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What information is available, particularly on prospective shortages, does not cover a comprehensive range of occupational areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is of concern to the committee that young people are not, in most cases, aware of the opportunities indicated by the available information.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report itself goes on to refer to the fact that we were told there were some 4,000 skilled jobs Australia&hyphen;wide in the hotel industry that were unfilled and that there was an acute shortage of some 1,000 chefs Australia&hyphen;wide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also found that there was a shortage of welders and other skills in rural areas of New South Wales, and that some employers told of difficulties in filling apprenticeships and traineeships in some rural and remote areas. That was the point the member for Longman was making. In the manufacturing industry, the MTIA has reported a wide range of skill shortages in occupations such as technicians and engineers, in several trades and for sales people with technical backgrounds. What the government should be doing&mdash;and they should accept some responsibility here&mdash;is taking some steps to match these skill shortages with our school leavers and potential school leavers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found the work on this report extremely interesting. I was very impressed, in our deliberations and in going around Australia, with the attitude of young people. In many cases they are misunderstood. In most cases they do have a great desire to work. The only thing that deters them from time to time is the lack of employment. However, I do hope that some of the committee's recommendations will contribute towards making more employment opportunities available to young people. I note that some people on the speakers list were not members of the committee, so I look forward in particular to their contributions because they will come at this from a different angle. I will leave my remarks at that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth employment: a working solution</EMPHASIS> . I do so with great pride, as other members of the House of Representatives Employment, Education and training Committee have, and as a member of the committee responsible for tabling the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we enter parliament, whatever our political allegiance, we invariably do so with the expectation, with the belief and with the conviction, I imagine, that our very presence in parliament will make a difference, if not to our nation, at least to our electorate and those we represent. Some may say that this is naivety. I do not subscribe to such a proposition. My 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11991"> experience with, and the recommendations contained in, this report are proof of the excellent work which can be achieved in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been widely acknowledged by all commentators that the greatest shame facing our generation is the plight of Australia's youth, be it in terms of youth homelessness, youth suicide or youth unemployment. The correlation between these three characteristics is indisputable. It is a collective shame affecting not only suburban Australia but also regional Australia. This report, particularly the majority report supported by all government members, makes recommendations which are part of the process to righting the wrongs affecting our young kids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of the inquiry appeared straightforward: to examine the factors which influence the employment of young people and to identify how their employment prospects could be improved. On the surface it was quite straightforward, although at times witnesses and members had to restrain themselves from delving into issues of youth unemployment and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite party allegiances, I am pleased to say that most members approached this inquiry without any of their own prejudices and ideological biases. In fact, by the end of our inquiry, our faith in our young people was affirmed. The great majority of kids out there want to work, despite the outrageous and flippant remark by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson)&mdash;I imagine it was more a flippant than a serious remark; I give him credit for that&mdash;that kids only want to go back to bed in the morning. Kids out there really do want to work and they want to have a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do acknowledge, as previous speakers have acknowledged, that, while there is a strong desire to work, the number of jobs present in Australia at the moment is certainly far from sufficient to cover the demands. Young people want to work and employers want to employ them but they want to employ them only if the conditions are right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We found in submissions from the employers that they are looking for conditions such as young people having the right attitude to work, a willingness to work, a desire to learn, punctuality, honesty and appropriate personal behaviour and presentation. They are looking for high levels of literacy standards; they are looking for young people who have a basic knowledge, at least, of the world of work gained through effective schools to work transition programs. I note here, and I will talk a little more about, the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation and the jobs pathway program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers are also looking for the disincentives to employ young people to be removed&mdash;namely, the unfair dismissal provisions, the need to pay adult wages and an exemption from superannuation and payroll tax. All of these matters are covered quite well in the report. Some of these measures are well within the scope of this government and, may I say, the opposition to embrace, but I know that the debate on unfair dismissal provisions, youth wage and exemption from payroll and superannuation will continue to be a political football as the lives of our kids are held in the balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers have consistently rated attitudinal qualities higher than skills themselves. A witness to the inquiry, Ms Kirsten Palmer, the Melbourne Region Director of Work Placement Inc., typified the comments by employers quite nicely by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What employers are really saying they want is the attitude. What they are wanting is the preparedness to work more than lip&hyphen;service&mdash;being able to take personal responsibility . . . If the kid does not have the right attitude to start with, you cannot teach them anything about work sills. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11992">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So there is an acceptance by a number of employers that they are quite willing to actually do their part in providing the training, the skills development, required for the job. They are not necessarily looking to the schools to do that. If the schools do, of course it is a bonus, but as long as the schools prepare those young kids for the world of work they have more than an even break.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of that preparation is the issue of literacy. Much has been made about literacy in recent times. The importance of literacy is indisputable, and I am proud of the fact that a number of schools in my electorate of Deakin have embraced the need to increase the level of literacy among their students. I am pleased to see that the difficulties encountered by a very parochial and often defensive group of state ministers throughout the country are finally being worked out. They are finally coming to the realisation that a compromise on literacy benchmarks, as proposed by the recent study by ACER, is selling our young people's employment prospects short.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Literacy leads to greater self&hyphen;confidence, longer school retention rates and inevitably to higher employability. I congratulate in particular one school in my electorate, Tintern Girls Grammar School, for being a pathfinder in the area of literacy with its excellent work in lifting the level of literacy in its students. Recently, I was pleased to be able to host a visit by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) at Tintern. May there be more schools like Tintern; I know they are certainly out there in the electorates of other honourable members. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs is certainly putting into practice the very measures dealing with literacy which we have proposed under recommendation 3.1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other interesting recommendations from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training has been the proposal for a national youth guarantee&mdash;I am not sure whether many other members have spoken about this today&mdash;whereby every young student is guaranteed education from primary school right through to year 12 in secondary school. I am sure it is a guarantee that will strike a resounding chord in the electorate; it is that `every Australian under 21 years of age who has not attained year 12 at school will be funded a place at a high school, TAFE or a recognised training provider to complete a year 12 education or its equivalent'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am always hesitant to be embracing guarantees of any kind. I would hate to see this guarantee go to the scrap heap of other more notable guarantees of our time, such as the infamous `No young person shall live in poverty'&mdash;that infamous, hollow rhetoric uttered by the former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke. Of course, that is the nature of guarantees&mdash;it is a black or white situation. However it is certainly a notable and worthwhile guarantee to be discussing and proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that our recently introduced common youth allowance will help to facilitate this recommendation through financial incentives and by providing our young kids with the opportunity to invest in their own future, so that they do stay at school that little bit longer and they do take the opportunity to embrace training and skills development for their own employability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the notable discrepancies that this committee encountered in its inquiry is the value that is still attached to vocational education and training. I have spoken in this House on numerous occasions of the excellent work by this government to reinvigorate vocational education and training from its deplorable run&hyphen;down state.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11993">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government failed to recognise the value that the public still places on such things as apprenticeships and traineeships. Part of this educational process, of course, is having a strong work experience program. The Australian Student Training Foundation is one very notable organisation which runs excellent programs. It was a pleasure to be able to go to places like Salisbury High School&mdash;a school in South Australia well known by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford)&mdash;and see the excellent partnership that has been developed between school, industry, industry groups and the foundation itself. Their efforts and success should be a model for other schools in this country. That particular model is replicated a number of times throughout the country but it is nowhere near as prevalent as it should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an employer of work experience students in my past life and now as an MP, I know work experience can be an excellent and rewarding experience for young people and for the employer, but too often the experience is a failure. The expectations of students of what they will learn and the lack of attention by the employers to the training requirements and their lack of willingness to make it a learning experience create a disappointing outcome. Young people should not just be seen as another pair of hands. The employer should not just be a recipient of some other employer's dedication and preparedness in helping young kids to make that transition from school to work. It would be fair to say that an element of altruism in business will never go astray and that every business should play a part in helping these young kids make the leap from school to work. Work experience is one part of that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer specifically to two recommendations that were made by the committee. Recommendations 3.3 and 3.4 propose that the ASTF be given greater credence and support by this government and by the opposition. The committee recommended that the ASTF's criteria be promoted and be made a national standard for all workplace educational programs and that we should implement national guidelines, as far as practicable, for the assessment of workplace education programs. These are recommendations which I know, if embraced, will help these young kids to make that transition from school to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of a young person's preparation for the world of work is the knowledge of what to expect, how to search for work, the nature of various occupations and the attitudes required for work. These require strong and effective counselling. The honourable member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) spoke on career guidance in his response to this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee found that the three important references that kids turn to for their career guidance are their peers, their family and their career teachers. Throughout the country we found deplorable career guidance situations. The member for Greenway and I travelled to two locations in Western Australia which particularly indicated the parlous state of career guidance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state of careers guidance really did vary dramatically across the nation. It is fair to say that the greatest critics of the standards of careers education and guidance were in fact the students themselves. One student, in Carnarvon, as I recall, said to his careers teacher, `I think you'd better go and write your resume, Sir.' That was indicative of the contempt in which that careers teacher was held. I must say I was disappointed when, on the way out to the airport that same day, we heard that the careers guidance teacher, after making his appearance at the hearing, had gone off surfing. I am not sure exactly to what extent he is interested in the kids of that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to place the blame totally on careers teachers, because I believe that in a lot of cases they themselves have been put into their position with few resources. Often, not only 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11994"> do the students not know who is responsible for careers guidance, but also they may only get one or two hours for the whole year in which to learn the art of being able to get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer in particular in this regard to the comment by one of the careers teachers, as an example of the position in which they have been placed. Ms Debbie Ralston from Kambalda Senior High School said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have just finished university and this is my first year of teaching. I have been given the vocational education program for the Year 10s. I admit that I have no idea, so it is like one of the kids said: the blind leading the blind . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the position that that teacher was placed in, which was to the detriment not only of the teacher but also of the kids themselves. The committee found that poor career guidance is partly responsible for skill shortages in some parts of the country, as well as for young people not knowing the opportunities that exist in the skilled trades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have liked to have spent more time on this debate, but I will take the opportunity elsewhere to talk about what great work careers guidance teachers are doing in my area, particularly with the jobs pathway program, which 29 local schools out of 76 schools across the nation will soon be embracing to help kids in a school transition program. I will talk more about that at some other stage. I would like to say in closing that it was a pleasure to be on this committee. I do congratulate all members of the committee and, in particular, the then chairman of the committee, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who is no longer the chairman of the committee, for the fine work in producing and tabling this report as well as organising the submissions we have heard. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not one of those on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, but I have certainly read the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth employment: a working solution</EMPHASIS>  with a great deal of interest, given the interest that I and all members, I am sure, have taken in the problems of youth unemployment in our own particular electorates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The term of reference for this particular committee inquiry was the factors influencing the employment of young people. From listening to some of the speakers here this morning, I think that to some degree we are missing the point that, until we generate the sorts of jobs that can be taken up by young people, whether they be unskilled when they begin or university graduates, then we really are running around in some sort of circle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has no doubt that the great majority of young people want to work. Nor have I any doubt that the vast majority of young people want to work. Even those who come into my office seeking an explanation of the social security system say, `We'd give this away if there could be a job at the end of the day.' The fact is that full&hyphen;time jobs have fallen 59 per cent for teenagers over the past 15 years&mdash;a point which is made in this report. One of the weaknesses is that, until we can generate more jobs in this economy&mdash;and worldwide, for that matter&mdash;we are really whistling in the wind when we talk about there being jobs necessarily out there that people will not take up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 2.1 of this report asks that training be a component of labour market programs. One of the tragedies of this particular government's policy was the dismantling of some of those labour market programs&mdash;not all of them&mdash;so that there was a recirculation of young people, to a great degree. I always thought that, instead of 26 weeks, it should have been three years with two days per week of involvement in a long&hyphen;term project, so that there 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11995"> could be a sense of belonging to something&mdash;so that it was not a quick fix and a one hit for those people who were then put, disillusioned, back on the end of the queue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there were elements of that labour market program that addressed the particular needs of those without skills who, even with an extra couple of years of high school, were not the sort of material able to be taken up in the traineeship and apprenticeship programs&mdash;and I will get on to those in a moment, too. What we need to address is that vast number of people we have out there in the community who 20 years ago would have been working on the roads, or would have been the process workers, or who would have gone to the Edgells factory in Bathurst, or would have had unskilled work with councils or with a vast array of organisations. They are the sorts of people that we have to give meaningful long&hyphen;term occupation to if we are serious about addressing the social ramifications of that dramatic reduction in job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best available opportunity for these people at the moment is a work for the dole program without a training component. I noticed that in the committee's deliberations in Mount Isa there was a comment from Rodney Wilkinson, the managing director of Mount Isa Group Apprenticeship, who said that if work for the dole is structured training, and there are job outcomes for it, it will work. There probably will not be job outcomes, but there should be some structured training in this work for the dole program or it is really, in my mind, only window&hyphen;dressing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the traineeship and apprenticeship program goes, full marks to the government for its attention to this area and its willingness to create more opportunities for the young people. But I am getting the message from small business that it really finds that it is being asked to take on the vast responsibility for traineeships and apprenticeships. The cost of labour alone worries them. Workers compensation, for example, is one particular factor they are terrified of. They need dramatic reforms in that area because if they have got to pay out, they cop the premium in the long run. It is not the insurance company that is paying it; the employer pays it down the track. I have got a truck operator in Bathurst who has $650,000 from a very spurious workers compensation claim. Of course, his insurance company may pay out the block amount, but he cops it in his premium in the years ahead down the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, 15 per cent of the adult wage back in the 1970s was the apprenticeship rate. Now it is something like 40 per cent. Again, I am getting the message from people in the construction and building industry that we cannot afford the add&hyphen;ons to employing the young.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is some sense in recommendations 5.7 and 5.8 of this particular report that the government legislates to exempt young people under the age of 21 from compulsory sponsored superannuation, and that it abolishes payroll tax on employees under 21. It may be all right to sit here and say that superannuation for all is a great concept and we have got to get these young people preparing for their retirement, and so on, but let us get them into jobs first. If these are major impediments to employment, let us look seriously at those recommendations because I believe that they make a lot of short&hyphen;term sense, at least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard, too, about careers guidance. It is okay to say that we need better skilled careers guidance teachers, and that we need more of them. We need more resources in this area. You can lead children down a career path and explain what particular jobs there are and prepare them for job readiness, but unless we are generating the jobs out there, much of this effort is wasted. Again, it is okay to have them job ready, but we have got to have the jobs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11996">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where have we lost those jobs? We have rail cutbacks in my area, the ADI downsizing, and the power industry now being downsized in preparation for privatisation. Where are these vast organisations getting traineeships or apprenticeships? They are getting them from the group apprenticeships schemes. For example, Pacific Power at Wallerawang used to have a huge training school for their apprentices. No more. If they need any apprentice, they get a part&hyphen;time one that is shared around the district in the group apprenticeship scheme. I think that there is a responsibility here for those organisations. Email, I suggest, is about the only one doing any serious training of young people in that particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a university emphasis in our treatment of young people and in particular in the cultural and the peer pressure that is imposed on them by not only their peers but their parents. In the report here it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The employment and educational expectations of school leavers are heavily influenced by parents, teachers, peers and television.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Hear, hear! I would suggest, as the member for Longman (Mr Brough) said, that we need to make TAFE far more sexy. It needs to be sold better. It has got some marvellous facilities that have not been well sold. I think that we have to convince young people that TAFE is a way of skilling themselves fairly rapidly, and more flexibly I would suggest, than is the university system. I have a young fellow who has just finished the HSC. He is not quite sure what he wants to do but he is going to do a business course, he hopes, at Newcastle uni in the hope that there may be something down the track that suits. We have some fairly heavy, but not too heavy, discussions. You do not want to push people too hard. Perhaps I should be applying this pressure from parents to go the uni course, but I am not saying that at all. I see some great opportunities in the TAFE system locally but unfortunately the kids want to leave home, spread their wings and fly to the coast. That is part of the difficulty in keeping them there and saying, `Look, there are some very viable options in the local TAFE college that you should seriously look at.' Five years down the track they may say, `I wish I had.' I hope not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyway, I noticed a newspaper editorial the other day saying the absence of positive proposals from our political leaders to foster investment in jobs is a scandal. I'll say it is. Labor seems to be suggesting that its new policy&mdash;and I think it is included in the tenor of the minority recommendations&mdash;will simply try to spread the existing amount of work among as many as possible while the coalition is still saying the economic fundamentals are in place so job creation is just down the track. It is not only just down the track. I think it is around the corner, through the tunnel, across the mountain and so far out of sight the young people who have not got the skills really are questioning what this system can deliver them. I am talking about those unskilled who should be picked up by those labour market programs specifically addressed to that particular problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have I got any answers? It is all right to sit and criticise. I think the government should take a more active role in the economy by way of maintaining and not cutting public jobs and supporting projects for infrastructure jobs. It could come up trumps after the scrutiny of the Parkes export airport project or by spending money on the Great Western Highway which was identified in the roads report as one of huge economic significance, but a poor accident record. Let us get serious about infrastructure projects like that, getting more freight by regulation back onto rail so we can regenerate those jobs on the per&hyphen;way gangs for the gangers along the western line and in the railway towns. All over Australia, I would suggest, rail offers a feasible alternative for public jobs to maintain infrastructure. We can then bring the private operators 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11997"> in to use that infrastructure, but not charge them what New South Wales rail access does, which is a factor by five out of the ballpark as far as TNT is concerned. They should not be expected to pay for infrastructure. I think we can and that would generate public jobs too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a bit more I wanted to say. Mobility is a problem for kids. Mount Isa, we heard, cannot fill up its apprenticeship quota. I do not think in the report I noticed any recommendation to this effect, but I think one should be there for a travel allowance system to be far more generous than it is now to get people to job opportunities. I have seen them not able to get from Rylstone to Mudgee to pick grapes because of the cost of the transport so we should be looking at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report looks at the Aboriginal unemployment problem. Page 30 suggests just how little creativity we have in terms of working out this problem:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The educational disadvantage experienced by Aboriginal young people is a difficult problem to address.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That certainly is not saying anything at all. Dare I suggest that recognition of native title&mdash;not extinguishment, not compensation&mdash;and recognition of the right to negotiate and not to own, and the esteem and the underlying support for the culture that would deliver might be a way of unlocking this dilemma? While we are doing so, how about restoring the CDEP program to what it was? There was work for the dole there before it was ever invented. It was happily accepted as a very productive program in many of our remote Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, we need to be generating jobs. We need to be not creating them, but generating them. I think that the government has a large role to play in this process through public expenditure. In the minute I have left I will read from a letter from Tudor Furniture in Sydney. Mr Benfield, the director, wrote to me that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With Australian import tariffs decreasing and employment costs continually increasing, to simply survive, we may follow the path of many Australian manufacturers . . . lay off staff and source products off shore.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our business currently employs 65 . . . By importing our products, we will eliminate all manufacturing and 1 clerical staff, replacing them with only 2 storemen . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This move will eliminate the major cost factors which are currently strangling our business, employer based taxes and liabilities. These are taxes, costs and liabilities which are applicable only to a labour intensive industry. i.e. Payroll Tax, Worker's Compensation, Redundancy Packages, Unfair Dismissal, Fringe Benefits Tax, Superannuation, as well as Annual Leave, Annual Leave Loading, Public Holidays, Long Service Leave, Sick Leave, Maternity Leave . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not agree with all of them being eliminated, but there is certainly plenty of room for thought there about how we can micro&hyphen;economically reform small business in giving them a fairer deal to generate jobs. There has to be a public part of it too. Public expenditure on public projects and public infrastructure is the short&hyphen;term key at least to generating more jobs, particularly for our young.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In beginning my short speech, taking note of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training Standing Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth employment: a working solution</EMPHASIS> , I say that I listened with keen interest to the speech of the member for Calare (Mr Andren). There is only one thing I would say to him: you do not successfully solve the unemployment problem by spending your way out of a crisis in unemployment. That is exactly how we got ourselves into the problem in the first place. While I know that he thinks long and hard about these issues, I would suggest that he thinks and perhaps reads some more about some of the reasons why the Australian economy went through the difficulties that it did in the 1980s and 1990s. One 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11998"> of the fundamental reasons was the debt levels that the federal government had racked up, both for the government and for the country. Public expenditure on infrastructure, while it has its place, is not the means by which you reduce youth unemployment. Perhaps that will be covered by other speakers in this debate as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I only wish to really cover the section of the report dealing with the youth wage. The youth wage was perhaps the most controversial and interesting aspect of the report. I am sure the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel) intends to deal with that matter too in his contribution, as he was the progenitor of the minority dissenting report of the committee. I am sure that the youth wage will feature in his contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Institutionalised youth unemployment will not be solved, as the Labor Party presently claims, by making cosmetic adjustments to impotent and antiquated job programs from the Keating era. The Labor Party boasted to all Australians that, after 13 years in government, they were on the precipice of full youth employment with their notorious tax and spend policies. Not only does the labour market policy of the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) trespass the boundaries of conventional wisdom, but also it fails miserably to account for the fundamental necessity to significantly reform this nation's approach to creating jobs for our youth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government has long maintained that creating more jobs for our youth is not only a priority but an issue that must be approached with innovation, ingenuity and enterprise. In doing so, we&mdash;the people and the government&mdash;must challenge previously accepted norms and practices. Accordingly, the standing committee was prepared to demonstrate real leadership by challenging these accepted norms, thereby creating the opportunities for more jobs for our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a responsible committee, we examined many different strategies that have varying degrees of merit. One such strategy is the scheme which has become colloquially known as the youth wage. It is a significant development, which I believe deserves responsible and constructive debate in this committee. Presently, in Australia, there exist three broad categories of wage arrangements which apply to the employment of young people. Statistics indicate that junior wage rates apply to approximately 52 per cent of employees under the age of 21. A further 13 per cent of employees under the age of 21 receive a trainee wage rate. The distinction between a junior rate and a trainee rate is that for these purposes a trainee is defined as an employee who undertakes structured training as a component of the employment duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A third category comprises employees under the age of 21 who receive adult wage rates. Estimates suggest that this includes 35 per cent of the work force who are aged under 21. As parliamentarians, we must ask ourselves whether this situation lends itself to greater employment opportunities and work force participation for the majority of our youth. Under the current structure, there is some doubt as to whether this is presently the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rates of national youth unemployment have been unacceptably high for many years. The former Labor government's approach to this problem ignored realities and avoided the tough decisions that needed to be made. The words of Mr John Gilmour, a managing director of an Australian company, are instructive. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wage structures for young people are too high, forcing us to demand greater productivity of them than their years and experience can provide.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Before extensively discussing the employment and financial issues related to this statement, I think it is equally important to consider the social issues which this statement raises. More 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11999"> specifically, I refer to the understandable and reasonable expectations of employers for optimum employee productivity and accomplishment which can often place unnecessary and distressing pressure on young employees to achieve a level of performance comparable to experienced employees who receive the same wage rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government is acutely aware of the pressures faced by young people; this government's announcement of an $18 million initiative to arrest the tragic increases in youth suicide is testimony to this. I do not believe that I am drawing too long a bow in suggesting that job related pressures do nothing to relieve the stress of young people. Whilst work related pressure is largely unavoidable in today's world, perhaps it could be alleviated for young people, to some degree, if unnecessary and avoidable pressures were removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is far more clear, however, is the economic and youth employment rate impact of the introduction of a youth wage. There is a general consensus among employers that many young people graduate from a secondary school education without adequate work skills and abilities, including literacy and numeracy skills&mdash;problem areas which this government has identified as a priority for improvement. That is not to say that these are skills which are beyond any potential employee. However, it is obvious that an employer has certain requirements from their employees and would generally not sacrifice these requirements in order to make a minimal saving on their weekly wage bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There exists a large body of statistics and anecdotal evidence which indicates that the archaic practice of employing cheap labour to minimise business operating costs is often an exercise in false economy. Quite simply, employers are not discouraged from employing the best person available by the incremental cost or saving offered by a lower wage rate or the benefit of a government subsidy which appears to make the package attractive to the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hidden costs for an employer engaging the services of a trainee can be both considerable and deceptive. Training tuition fees, and related costs, associated compliance costs, in addition to a range of employment on&hyphen;costs, all contribute to increasing the real outlay in employing a trainee. It is little wonder that employers are reluctant to chance the odds with an inexperienced young person whose employment tenure will be comparable in costs to those associated with the employment of an adult at the appropriate rates. There certainly exists compelling evidence to suggest that research should be undertaken to examine the relationship between the changes in the level of wages for young people and employment levels. That is a recommendation that the committee made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A survey conducted in 1990 by the Confederation of Australian Industry highlighted the significance and potential of appropriate wage rates for young people. Among the many conclusions of the survey was that employers are not predisposed to employ young people on the basis of the lower wage in isolation from other factors. Whilst young employees were often characterised as enthusiastic, employers frequently cited experience and productivity as the main considerations when assessing the suitability of a potential employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the research conducted it was almost unquestionably clear that employers do not decide to employ a young person on the sole basis of a lower wage rate. The significance of the advantage of an employee on a lower wage rate is only realised when the candidate has an advanced level of skills or experience which places them on a par with potential employees on an adult wage rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implementation of a government subsidy program was also widely dismissed as an effective measure to address national youth unemployment rates. This measure is merely a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12000"> short&hyphen;term fix to the problem of youth unemployment. No amount of subsidies or government initiatives will persuade a prudent employer to engage the services of a potential candidate who they do not think will make a satisfactory addition to their business. Productivity is the critical issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main concern for many employers is getting the appropriate person for the position in the long term and whether that person is going to perform to the standards that their business or interest requires to offset the higher supervision and training costs that come with employing the services of a young person. This is the fundamental concept of efficient resource utilisation and it is frequently the bottom line for successful business people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other strategies to alleviate youth unemployment lack the cohesive and cognitive reasoning of the youth wage. An often popular strategy is the competency based wages system. Under a competency based wages system, as young persons acquire measurable competencies their wages similarly increase. The Retail Council of Australia estimates that of the 280,000 juniors currently employed in the retail industry, approximately 200,000 will be replaced by adults under a competency based wages system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By further illustration, McDonald's Australia Ltd, a company which is fondly regarded by the coalition and often used in its examples, and its franchises employ over 40,000 young people. The skills associated with these positions are very specific but also very easily learnt. Similarly, Coles Myer, a company which employs over 110,000 young people, supports a youth wage rate but questions the feasibility of a competency based wages system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A competency based wages system also allows for the possibility of an unhealthy degree of subjectivity in assessing an employee's competency. The application of an established and administratively workable youth wage rate will remove this concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, a competency based wages system fails to account for the fact that certain occupations are physical skill intensive. An equitable and satisfactory application of a competency based wages system would be so complex that it would not be administratively feasible for the small business person. It would be a disincentive to employ a young person without experience. Indeed, the word `disincentive' appears to be a key descriptive word in most reports into youth employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another disincentive that exists under the current system is the access and availability of social security benefits that can often perpetuate an unemployment culture. A recent cover story by Ms Kerry&hyphen;Anne Walsh in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> magazine focused on this unemployment culture and the consequent recreational lifestyles of young people who are entrapped in that culture. Quite simply, the article suggested that the youth employment system inherited from the former Labor government excluded widespread participation. The system was inadequate, irrelevant and difficult to access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a topic which tends generally to generate confused debate. Anecdotal evidence is often quoted to imply that many young people have turned to a life at the beach on the dole rather than participate in the work force. I am very reluctant to accept this suggestion. In my electorate of Sturt I have yet to see any evidence of young people preferring unemployment benefits to a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I submit that previously mentioned benefits of a youth wages system are far more meritorious than the `dole money is a disincentive to young people' argument. In any case, I believe that the present work for the dole scheme adequately complements the benefits of a more formalised youth wage structure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12001">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the present youth wage structure has enjoyed qualified success, there is some anxiety as to the unfolding legislative landscape for youth wages. The Workplace Relations Act 1996 has exempted junior wages from the anti&hyphen;age discrimination provisions until 22 June 2000. Further provisions of this legislation empower the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to extend exemptions on an individual case basis following 22 June 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is therefore critical that this government continues the reform process and restructures the existing framework for employment opportunities for young people. Fair and equitable wage rates for young people will reinvigorate the employment market and will give small business, the engine room of the Australian economy, the confidence to take a chance on employing young and enthusiastic people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I congratulate the committee, which was mostly made of new members, from the class of 1996, on their report and on the interest that was quite obviously shown by the opposition in the conduct of the inquiry and in the report, evidenced by the comprehensive dissenting minority report which the opposition included as part of the overall report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to thank the secretariat, who did a large part of the effort and the work in pulling the whole matter together and ensuring that we had a quality assessment of youth employment in Australia and of the reasons business people do, or do not, employ young people. The expertise in our secretariats is manifest for all to see. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would agree that over your years in the House the secretariats of these committees have been of great assistance in fulfilling our requirements as members of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to congratulate the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) who chaired the committee in the conduct of this report and who has now been appointed chairman of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts. I wish him well as the chairman of that committee. We will miss him on the employment committee, which he has been a member of for six years minimum; I think he was a member of the employment committee when he first came into the House, so it would be close to seven or eight years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commence by also thanking and congratulating the secretariat on their fine work in supporting this inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into factors influencing the employment of young people. It was a very long inquiry; unfortunately, the time that the committee had to consider the evidence at the end of the day was very brief and the time that committee members had to compose, discuss and, ultimately, determine recommendations and the content of the actual report was very limited. Nevertheless, the work of the secretariat was first class.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most significant factor influencing the employment of young people, in my view and in the minority report's view, is jobs and the availability of jobs. Coalition members of the committee could not agree with this basic proposition, and that is one of the substantive reasons that compelled us to formulate a minority report. Even if all of the measures contained in the majority report were adopted and actually effected a significant change, at best what we would see is a change in the demographics of the unemployed, rather than a decrease in the number of the unemployed themselves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12002">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this government, youth unemployment has got worse, not better. This government was elected on a platform of fixing unemployment. They said, `Elect us and judge us on our performance in relation to employment.' What we have seen under this government is a worsening situation of unemployment. Essentially what this government has done is that it has gone on a deregulatory approach, thrown the issue over to the free market and expected that, having got what it regards as the economic fundamentals right, that will equate with growth and therefore somehow equate with employment growth. What we have seen is paper growth but not employment growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why Labor talks so much about industry policy&mdash;things like a steel plan, a TCF plan&mdash;and talks about having our hands on the levers to ensure that we are able to generate jobs growth and deliver the benefits for the community of economic growth. The community rightly expects, when it is promised a utopian future from economic growth, some return for all of the hype and the expectations which are raised from economic growth. What the community is not seeing is a return for all this economic growth that is supposed to deliver that utopian wonderland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within the majority report there are not concrete proposals to actually create jobs as such. There is a focus on increasing the competitive advantage of young people within the labour market itself, rather than on increasing the size of the labour market. Surely the focus of everyone's efforts must be on increasing the size of the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority report advocates, amongst other things, a highly questionable response to youth unemployment, focusing on youth wages and conditions. The youth unemployment rate has risen one full percentage point over the government's term from 26.8 per cent in February 1996 to 27.8 per cent at the time this report was written. That has been after fairly substantial, regressive reforms to industrial relations, so the supposed benefits of deregulating the labour market have not delivered employment growth&mdash;quite the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate of Fraser has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in the country. Late last year it hit 50 per cent and has fluctuated thereabouts for quite some time. But clearly, it is an utterly unacceptable unemployment rate, and I regularly see the consequences of it upon young people themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn briefly to some of the proposals of the majority report. One is to abolish superannuation for young people. This is a proposition which is predicated on the assumption that costs of youth employment are prohibiting or discouraging employers to take on young people. But there has been no real attempt at all by coalition members to cost the consequence of abolishing superannuation for young people, on young people themselves or on retirement incomes at the end of the track. That problem is essentially left for future governments to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a proposal to discount apprentice incomes for time spent in training. It is a double&hyphen;dip discount that is being advocated. Apprentice incomes are already discounted, partly in recognition for time spent in training and for all the various on&hyphen;costs and hidden costs that coalition members have talked about. They are already discounted, and they provide an extremely low level of income for young workers, but there has not been evidence, in my view, that compels a conclusion that says that the decline in apprenticeships has been caused by apprentice incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen is a fundamental change in what constitutes our economy, and those industries that traditionally engage apprentices have not grown at the same pace as newer 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12003"> industries that do not have a tradition of apprenticeship. Because of that, we have seen a change in the constitution of youth employment and a proportional reduction of apprentices, but that has not been because of apprentice incomes. The proposal by coalition members to effectively reduce apprentice incomes is, in my view, extremely regressive and does not acknowledge some of the underlying reasons for the proportional decline in the number of apprenticeships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some argument about a decline in the quality of apprentices that some employers&mdash;not all&mdash;have detected. Some employers say that they are quite happy with the quality of apprentices. Certainly, in my view there is evidence to suggest that the quality of apprentices these days is higher than it was in the past. You cannot argue, for example, that people being indentured are less educated now than they were 13 years ago; they are certainly better educated now than they were 13 years ago. The decline in apprenticeships can be sheeted home pretty much to changes in the economy rather than to a scapegoating proposition that says that it is young people themselves who are to blame and that the reason why employers are not engaging apprentices is that they cannot find good apprentices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a proposal that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), talked about removing protections that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission provides to youth wages. It is essentially a proposition that, in effect, freezes junior rates, because it is advocating that the rate be set by the parliament, effectively, rather than by the commission. Of course, the commission has to consider equity issues and fairness issues along with employment issues and the relative capacity of young people within the labour market to compete&mdash;the positive and negative things that they bring to the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, the coalition's proposal takes out of the equation those equity and fairness issues and fails in the majority report to examine the consequence of that proposition. It also fails, quite critically, to advocate a quantum of what that new junior rate would be. There is a great fear in my mind that what we are seeing here is a resurgence of propositions, advocated in Fightback, to do with junior rates. The coalition members do not say that they are proposing $2.50 per hour or $10 per hour. They do not say the actual rate that they are talking about, which is at the nub of the debate. They do talk a lot about their proposition or their assumption that the level of youth income prices young people out of the labour market. The evidence supporting that proposition is very scant indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statistical reality is that, in recent times, the comparative price of youth labour has decreased relative to adult labour and, at the same time, there has been an increase in youth unemployment. If the proposition is that wages substantially drive employment, you have a real problem in drawing the conclusion that youth incomes should be lowered, because, comparative to adult incomes, youth incomes have decreased, not increased, over time. But we have not seen a commensurate rise in youth unemployment, so the theory that is advocated by coalition members is not evidenced in reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst there has been a substantial increase in part&hyphen;time employment in recent years, nearly all part&hyphen;time jobs are held by students, with 90 per cent of these jobs being casual. These jobs are not secure and are not seen as possible career paths. The increase in part&hyphen;time work has, therefore, not directly helped the problem of youth unemployment. Again this is one of the changes in the nature of employment in Australia. There has been an increase in casualisation and a decrease in full-time employment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12004">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In August 1995, full&hyphen;time median weekly earnings for teenagers was $273 and $461 for young people from 20 to 24. A young person working 3&half; days a week on this median full&hyphen;time wage is living on the poverty line for single people or $191.24 a week. We have got this great number of young people living essentially on the poverty line, and that fact has to be recognised when coalition members talk about lowering the income bar further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of colleagues and I sought, in the majority report, some discussion and recognition of the consequences of lowering youth incomes. There was discussion, for example, on the cost of overtime on employers and whether overtime should be knocked off for young people. That recommendation subsequently was not made by the majority, but there was a lot of focus on it. The general focus has been on reducing costs, but there has been scant recognition&mdash;no real recognition&mdash;of the consequences of reducing those costs on young people themselves. If we have got a large number of people living on the poverty line, my view is that we need to take that into account. It is extremely important. As of July 1997, over 60 per cent of workers between 15 and 19 years of age worked part time. So this is a very serious issue indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basis of much of the research into the impact of youth wages on youth unemployment is analysed in the minority report, and I do not want to go over it too much. Essentially, I could summarise my problem with the coalition members' proposal to lower the overall youth income level as the rejection of `a fair day's work for a fair day's pay'. I support the concept of competency based wages. One witness, for example, complained about doing the same work as an adult but being paid less for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an argument that young people are regarded by employers as involving more risk than older workers do and, consequently, that they should be a bit cheaper to engage, in order to reduce their comparative disadvantage in the labour market. That is inherently contemplated with a competency based wage system. If you have a young person who is not as competent as an older worker, you have, within that proposition, a system for rectifying the comparative disadvantage of young people in the labour market. But what we have instead is an age based discrimination that has not challenged or fundamentally rewritten the disadvantage that young people have within the labour market. A competency based wages system is a reasonable proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition of a national youth wage is, in my view, going to be a regressive proposition, having regard to the sorts of issues that are highlighted by coalition members in the majority report. As I have said, the impact of cutting youth incomes is quite dramatic. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the parliamentary Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and as a member for an electorate which inherited and suffers high youth unemployment levels, I would like to add my observations and comments following the release of the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth employment: a working solution</EMPHASIS> . However, before doing so, I would like to recognise the professional way all inquiries were conducted by the chairman, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), and by the deputy chairman, the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), and also the assistance provided by the secretariat of Paul McMahon, James Rees and Gaye Milner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I just remind the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel) that the theory and rhetoric he has just gone on with do not put young people into jobs? He forgets it is the small businesses of Australia which are our major employers. Unemployment is still the number one issue 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12005"> facing not only our young people but society as a whole. Recent statistics released by Centrelink show that the youth unemployment rate in some parts of my electorate of Gilmore has dropped by 0.4 per cent last month and is still dropping, which is good news. But try telling that to the 26 per cent of young Australians who are still without work. The statistics are frightening and are an indictment of how we as a community, and our governments, have failed our young people over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statistics also have a face. They are now our children and grandchildren, nieces and nephews, relatives and friends. For the past decade, unemployment has no longer been considered as something which just happens to someone else. Many families throughout the Gilmore electorate are affected by youth unemployment. They are supporting a young person&mdash;if not necessarily financially, then most certainly emotionally. For the cost of unemployment is not only in monetary terms: young people who do not have a job lose a major way of networking in the community. They lose access to the normal interactions of a society which spends at least 40 hours per week&mdash;and, in many cases, more&mdash;in not only work situations but also social environments which have their own sets of rules and regulations and their own hierarchies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a society which places more than a monetary value on having a job, young unemployed people are the big losers in terms of low self&hyphen;esteem, low social skills and little or no self&hyphen;respect. While the doom and gloom picture must be acknowledged, it is much more important to address ways in which we as a community can improve young people's vision of their employment opportunities and therefore of their future. This is what we as the parliamentary standing committee have done, with this report. While much of the report and national attention focuses on youth experiences of employment, unemployment and training, one of the most important issues which must be acknowledged and addressed is the need to match the skills of the young person with the requirements of industry&mdash;the difficulty then being to define who matches these skills and whose responsibility it is. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear to the committee that the expectations of young people and employers do not always match each other closely enough, and perceptions on both sides do not necessarily match the facts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I can give you a very timely example of this. Last week, I hosted four of the brightest students from one of the high schools in my electorate of Gilmore. Having invited these four young people to Parliament House to give them a first&hyphen;hand view of the political process, not only have I admired the way they have handled themselves but I have also been interested to note the change in their attitudes in the four days that they have been here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these students had an expectation of attending university to study, and prior to their arrival in Parliament House, several were considering a career in politics, while the others were looking more towards law and foreign affairs. During the week they sat at dinner with some of the members and senators to discuss a range of issues, including their future&mdash;more importantly, their perceptions of their future. Of note were their replies to questions about where they were going and what they were doing. Already there were second thoughts about certain tertiary courses which they had already applied for. Having spoken to several staff members throughout the House, these students were already considering a switch to broader education and skill requirements, rather than the traditional narrow lines of study such as were, and still are, presented as the primary options in schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These students are now looking not so much at a single degree, as at combining degrees, as well as some practical experience in the field of politics and further discussions with staff 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12006"> about working requirements. I believe that this is a prime example of where we are letting our young people down by not providing enough of a link between school and work to show them the real requirements of their chosen fields.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same is true for the employers' perspective. The committee report noted several major concerns with regard to the requirements of the job and the skills of job applicants. It found that employers place paramount importance on attitude factors when making employment decisions. As a co&hyphen;director of a small business which employs some 30 people, I am well aware of the often frustrating experience of not being able to find suitable applicants for a position. Some have the right skills but the wrong attitude towards work. Others are willing to work but do not have the appropriate training and education. So where did we go wrong?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a submission to the committee, a Melbourne based work placement company commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What employers are wanting is the preparedness to work rather than lip&hyphen;service  . . . and being able to take personal responsibility . . . If the kid does not have the right attitude to start with . . . you cannot teach them anything about work skills!</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Part of that attitude comes from their background and family which was a point highlighted in the report. Families these days need to recognise that those young people who do not go on to tertiary education, like the 70 per cent who do not, also need the encouragement and challenge of a career. However, these challenges can be limited, as the report has shown, if the required literacy, numeracy and basic skills have not been concentrated on. These, together with the building of expectations towards a job that may not be available in today's society, are without a doubt the responsibility of the school process, as is the lack of sufficient information being made available to the students on the availability and training requirements of the jobs of today, as opposed to those of yesteryear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today's business owners and operators look at what sort of role models young people aspire to and follow, especially in terms of family. According to a study by Flinders University students, many employers will employ on the basis of the recommendations of other workers who know someone who is available. The advocacy and information networks which are present in that form of labour market are very important in the matching process of a young person's skills and attitudes with the employer's requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also clear in the inquiry that industry and business have a role to play. In fact, the report notes that few businesses, large or small, take on the role of getting into their community or schools to promote their industries or businesses and the job opportunities that they offer. This was particularly apparent in rural and remote areas where many of the young people interviewed could not tell the committee what job opportunities were available in the industries around their towns. So while employers were talking about the lack of interest in the jobs which were available, none of them had been to see their local high schools to talk to students about jobs in their industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This important process of matching young people with appropriate employment is very real. The jobs are there, as indicated in the recent jobs telethon&mdash;although I see in the newspapers recently that thousands of them have still to be taken up because, once again, the employer's requirements and the applicant's prospects were not matched appropriately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often claimed that young people do not want to work. Yet the committee found that only one in 300 young people interviewed had a negative attitude towards work. I would at this point like to compliment those who were interviewed. I was impressed by their honesty, frankness and genuine interest in obtaining a job for themselves. It certainly gave me an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12007"> opportunity to reflect on their comments and upon perceptions in the community of the young people who really do want to work but are unsure how to go about it simply because of a lack of knowledge or family support. This is supported by a recent survey by the Shoalhaven area consultative committee which shows that 70 per cent of all respondents would be willing to work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the Green Corps program, which I had the honour of opening recently at Bundanon, an arts icon in Nowra, was oversubscribed by young unemployed volunteers, too many for them to handle in one project. They have applied to conduct a second Green Corps project. These are young people who are volunteering to in effect work for the dole, while showing a genuine commitment to the environment and learning new skills and an appropriate attitude towards work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also found that there was a general failing by parents, schools and industry to adequately inform young people about the needs of employers and the realities of the youth labour market. I would like to focus on just one example of the clash of realities which was highlighted by the report. When a company first advertised for trainees to come in, they got nobody interested. Yet when they advertised for a manager of one of their shops, they all had these school students in year 12 applying for the manager's job, because it had a mobile phone and a car and they could wear a nice tie and a white shirt to work. But nobody wanted to come in and do the traineeship. Yet they all thought they were managerial material and no doubt some of them were. The realities of the employment market are not the same as the expectations of those applying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers also have expectations and attitudes towards young employees. On a number of occasions the committee heard comments which indicated employers would not employ young people because of their perceptions of them. It is time that someone was open and transparent with them and explained that applying for a job with long hair, thongs and dirty clothes is not the way to instil confidence in a would&hyphen;be employer, be it male or female. It is also worth noting that employers showed no sex discrimination. They simply wanted someone who fitted their criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a recent survey the Bank of South Australia found that 57 per cent of people thought that young people required constant supervision. The burden, whether real or imagined, this places on an employer, in terms of perceived additional costs, is enough of a disincentive to employ young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is vital that young people are assisted to make a smooth transition from school to the work force, whether that be directly through training programs or through tertiary education. In Gilmore and the Illawarra region, the government has already allocated an extra $7 million for 2,800 apprenticeships and traineeships and $6.9 million for a Nowra campus of the University of Wollongong, 470 places for job placement for the unemployed and 270 places in work for the dole projects. Together with the Shoalhaven's own work for the dole program and Green Corps these show the commitment of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Investment and initiatives for small businesses have also encouraged local industries to open their doors a little more to young people. But, at a Chamber of Commerce meeting recently in the Southern Highlands, I was again told that small business will not employ more staff until the new workplace relations laws are passed, in particular the laws which exempt small businesses from facing unfair dismissal claims within the first 12 months of employing staff. This was highlighted at every place the committee visited and must eventually be recognised 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12008"> by those opposite as being a real threat to future employment for both the youth and adult population. I cannot believe that the opposition is constantly opposing this initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the whole community has a role to play in improving the future employment prospects of young Australians. One important way we can do this is to stop talking down their future prosects and to stop saying, `There are no jobs for you out there, so don't bother.' There are jobs. We need to make sure the expectations of young people and their prospective employers are evenly matched.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also made quite clear that such issues as distance of travel, lack of transport and lack of suitable affordable accommodation for those prepared to move away from home to seek a job were a problem being experienced by the young people trying to find employment. These issues must be addressed by the whole community. We all have a role to play and I welcome the report by the committee as the base on which we can continue to provide job opportunities for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, may I also say how pleased both I and the electorate of Gilmore were in being able to host the visit by the committee to Nowra, thereby allowing them to witness first&hyphen;hand the strength, commitment and determination of our young people in the Shoalhaven. Their attitude showed that those who wanted to work can do and will do. All they need is an opportunity and a bit of guidance.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth employment: a working solution</EMPHASIS>  is one of the most important reports that has been delivered by this 38th parliament of Australia. It is a tribute to the former chairman, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), whose constant and sustained efforts to improve what should be a culture of wealth and employment creation in this country are a model for us all. The report examines those things working for and against young people in the labour market, something not previously done with such rigour and sincerity, in order to find solutions by all members of the committee, whatever their political affiliations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As young Australians leaving school have their hopeful optimism diminished to some extent by the knowledge that one in four will be unemployed for a period of time, it is well worth remembering the words of the British historian Kenneth Clark. After years of analysing the history of numerous cultures and societies in the BBC television series <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Civilisation</EMPHASIS>, he concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is a lack of confidence more than anything else that kills a civilisation. We can destroy ourselves by cynicism and disillusionment just as effectively as by bombs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This report&mdash;and in particular the majority report&mdash;is founded on a dispassionate, non&hyphen;ideological view of what is required to assist young people in the labour market. It is a tribute to the commonsense of both the committee and its individual members, whatever their political backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also touches on one of the experiences that actually brought me into politics. On 2 June 1992, I addressed the National Press Club about the health and the human effects of unemployment. When I had finished, Ian Spicer, who was then the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was asked a question about the employment of young people. Spicer got up and gave a reply that was based on a survey that the chamber had just completed of the top 200 employers in Australia. Essentially, Spicer said that there needed to be a change to the way in which youth wages and working conditions were to be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12009"> negotiated and that this had been identified almost universally by the top 200 employers as the major barrier to employment of young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before he could even get his backside back on the chair, Bill Mansfield, who was then the vice&hyphen;president of the ACTU, jumped up and said, `Absolutely under no circumstances will the union movement of Australia ever talk to employers about anything like that.' I must say I said to the audience, `My goodness. Listen to this. Here are the people who create jobs, and who could and should employ more young people, saying this is the problem&mdash;whatever the merits of their solution.' Then we had the labour movement and those representing working people saying they were not even going to talk about it at a time when we had 34 per cent youth unemployment nationally, as we do now. We have up to 50 per cent youth unemployment in some sections of Australia&mdash;for example, Liverpool in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said to one of my staff, as I left the Press Club that day, that it seemed so stark and obvious to me that the way we think and our attitudes and the way we go about trying to resolve our problems, particularly in terms of employment creation, have to change. Most young people want to work. Most young people are not bludgers. Most young people are not unemployed through choice. There have always been lazy people and there always will be. Some are young and some are old. But the vast majority do want to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the figures published in the report. Full&hyphen;time and part&hyphen;time employment for 15&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds have dropped by three per cent since 1982. By comparison, in the same period of time, total full&hyphen;time employment has grown by 16.2 per cent, and total full&hyphen;time and part&hyphen;time employment has grown by 31.2 per cent. In other words, the job opportunities for young Australians have actually contracted in the last 15 years. In making that observation, I can assure you I am not passing critical judgment of governments in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me address some of what I think are the most important recommendations of the report. The first is recommendation 3.1 that literacy and numeracy be taught in every primary school and be regularly tested and that there be resources committed to rectifying deficiencies in individual students. This is something that I think the parliament, both sides of the House, needs very much to support. I ran two small businesses, employing about 40 people&mdash;albeit, within the sheltered workshop of Medicare&mdash;for about five years. I was then privileged to be the head of an organisation with an $8 million budget employing considerably more people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people applied for a job, they would send their CVs and an application. No matter what the quality of what they were saying, if they could not spell basic words, and if the grammar was poor, you would discard that application and put it into another batch. I do not say that as an avaricious, self&hyphen;interested individual but rather as an employer who wanted people with some basic skills. We are doing a great disservice to young people if we do not ensure that this recommendation is adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, for whom Cheryl Kernot and most of us, I think, quite rightly have a very high regard, in his outstanding address to the Trade Union Congress in Britain on 9 September this year about the modernisation of Britain&mdash;I wish Mr Beazley could give a similar speech in Australia&mdash;made the observation that bringing kids up to meet minimum literacy and numeracy standards, or words to that effect, and continuing to offer a lousy education, is not in the interests of everybody and would not be tolerated by the British government. In a sense that is what our government is now saying here in Australia and I hope, in doing so, it is supported by the opposition.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12010">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important issue that the report addresses is age based wages. The report acknowledges the lack of detailed research examining the relationships between changes in the level of wages and employment levels but coalition members&mdash;quite rightly in my opinion&mdash;recommended that the government make a submission to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission inquiry opposing the abolition of junior wages, as presently required under the sunset provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. This recommendation goes to the very heart of the issue of unemployment, and youth unemployment in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the most recent public hearing of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, with the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, I repeated the question that I had put to him six months earlier, that is, if growth is the solution to unemployment, why is it that after six years of continuous growth, we have 8&half; per cent unemployment. On the most recent occasion, he was prepared to recognise that it is much more than the mantra of growth only, as promoted in recent years by the bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the growth we have had in the six&hyphen;year expansion since the recession we had to have in 1990&hyphen;91, the employment growth has been relatively weak. Compared with other developed countries, such as the United States and Britain, Australia has enjoyed similar per capita growth in GDP of about 3.7 per cent per year but our employment growth has averaged a miserable 1.7 per cent per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at New Zealand, which has had similar GDP growth to us, it has outstripped us with an average employment growth of 2.9 per cent. The US has enjoyed GDP growth of around 2.6 per cent per annum over the last six years but they have had employment growth of 1.5 per cent. In other words, our economy has been growing&mdash;I think all of us are pleased to see that we have averaged 3.7 per cent growth&mdash;but we are managing employment growth that is less than half our growth in GDP. Therefore, clearly, growth in itself is not the solution to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue for young people in particular is whether this is due to a more aggressive growth in labour productivity or because employers shed labour or avoid labour that they consider to be too expensive. The report recognises that we really need more research into the relationship between minimum wages, the price of labour and the employability of young people. In essence, our impressive growth rate has not given us as many jobs as comparable countries because real wages growth has been unrealistic for the excess capacity in the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that this conclusion seems persuasive, at least to me, is that over the past six years, as I said, in which we sustained 1.7 per cent real wages growth, the US experienced 0.9 per cent real wages growth and the New Zealanders have had none. The other point, coming back to Tony Blair's speech to the Trade Union Congress, is that the unions need to be as concerned about the people who do not have work as those who do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I surveyed my electorate last April and I will do it again in April next year, and the number one issue of concern to people was unemployment. If you ask Australians what they are most concerned about, unemployment will be right up the top. However, what actually happens is that on polling day most people say to themselves, `I've got a job. I don't think I am going to lose it,' and they will vote on other issues. A significant minority will vote on the basis of unemployment. I have a feeling that most Australians at the moment would rather live with 8&half; per cent unemployment rather than pay the social and the economic costs that are necessary to make some real inroads into it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12011">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The winter edition of the Reserve Bank's economic round&hyphen;up sought to quantify the two effects of GDP growth and wages growth on employment. The first effect was that a one percentage point increase in non&hyphen;farm GDP in the current quarter will increase employment by 0.8 per cent after five quarters. The second effect was that a one percentage point increase in real wages in the current quarter will reduce employment by about 0.3 per cent after five quarters, most of the decrease coming in the first two quarters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, whilst on the one hand you have growth increasing employment and opportunities for young people, on the other hand every time we increase real wages by one percentage point we are reducing employment by 0.3 per cent. That is something that everybody concerned for the employment of young people needs to think long and hard about whether it is governments, whether it is the Industrial Relations Commission, whether it is unions who are doing their best to represent working people, or whether it is parents who are just simply worried about whether their kids are going to have a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several years ago the Secretary to the Treasury, Ted Evans, said that unemployment was a policy of choice, and it is a sentiment I see recently reiterated by Professor Ross Garnaut from the ANU. I again ask myself the questions: are we serious? Are we prepared to pay the social and the economic price that is necessary to reduce unemployment and to create employment opportunities for young people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very privileged at the moment because I represent the most affluent electorate in the country, but as I discovered when I was president of the AMA, if you want to change the world you need people with influence behind you. I was equally privileged for almost eight years to work in the second poorest part of Australia, a public housing estate where there were three generations of welfare dependency, 13 per cent employment, and where people really had lost hope. They felt they had been cut off from the economic mainstream of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are really serious about unemployment, as they have been in Britain and as they have been in the United States, we need to have a serious debate in Australia about issues that are politically unpopular. We have to look at minimum wages and their relationship to the social security system. We have to look at the relationship of our taxation system to the labour market. There has to be a serious examination of the impact of wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and capital gains tax on employability. We have to look at negative income taxes for low income people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to look at the relationship between public housing, where people live, and the employment market. As an example, most of the people in Bridgewater and Gagebrook and that satellite public housing estate in outer northern Hobart, where I spent a lot of my time working, will find it four times harder to get a job than somebody living in Glenorchy in the outer suburbs of Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must look at the relationship of the social security system and the safety net that we provide to low income people and its impact on the labour market. We must look at the interaction between schools, the education system, and the labour market. We must look at the impact of technology, the industrial relations system and labour market flexibility and dismissal provisions. We must look at state based regulations and the way they prevent employment from growing. Most importantly, we have to listen to employers about what is necessary to make them more inclined to take a risk, to acquire debt, to get out of bed, and to prefer to employ a person rather than take on another machine. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some brief comments with respect to the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth employment: a working solution</EMPHASIS> . I was part of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training at the commencement of this inquiry, although I had moved on to other committees by the conclusion of the inquiry. On that basis I will not use my full time, but I would like to make a couple of points with respect to this matter at this time. I will focus particularly on some aspects of the minority recommendations and the report produced by some members of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the issues which came up was labour market program funding. As I understand it, the view from the majority of the committee was that there was not a need for an expansion in that area, or certainly not for a restoration to previous levels. I would like to make a couple of comments on that issue in terms of how it impacts on the situation of young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is often much debate about the question of labour market programs in terms of how they are seen and what is meant to be their actual operation and their worth. I think it misses a key point. The issue often with labour market programs&mdash;in some respects it is actually a misnaming&mdash;is the question of results in terms of jobs. As I know people who were involved in this inquiry are aware, attitudes and the conditions faced by young people are important considerations in determining their employability and their likely success in the employment market. The fact is that a lot of labour market programs that were in place in previous years, and that ought to be in place now, were aimed at that harder end of the scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about labour market programs it is not just that there is this thing called a labour market program. There should be a range of different programs that impact at different levels with respect to age, to experience and to the conditions faced by the people that they seek to serve. Programs that are designed to take into account those who have become long&hyphen;term unemployed and who are seriously at risk of never getting employment again&mdash;and often this can be a situation faced by young people&mdash;have to take into account those sorts of conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that you cannot expect to have a strike rate in terms of employment for programs of that nature at 60, 70 or 80 per cent. Often you are talking about 20, 30 or 40 per cent&mdash;and, in some respects, so you should be, because the fact is that you could not expect to be that successful with people in those sorts of conditions. Often it is a process of moving people along to that area and that condition of employability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that if people are in a situation where they have been out of employment for a long time or, in the case of unemployed youth, have never been in employment, there is a need to build up those skill levels. Those skill levels can be very basic; it can be the question merely, as has been mentioned by other speakers, of getting out of bed in the morning and being on time, of being in a situation where you actually see that there is a chance of employment and you can see that there is a way forward. This question of attitude that often impacts on people who are unemployed is about that situation of hopelessness that basically overwhelms them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know from my own experience when I was a bit younger&mdash;when I probably could have been classified as a youth, just&mdash;and was unemployed for some six months that I had great difficulty in focusing my own mind to a situation where I felt that I was still a worthwhile member of society and capable of contributing. For some months that was a real difficulty. That was after having completed a degree and still being in my early 20s, but in a situation where I did not feel there was a place for me&mdash;this was in the early 1980s&mdash;in employment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12013">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at those sorts of programs we have to look at the question of that role that they play and the importance of that role in making younger people in particular employable. When we talk about labour market programs we have to understand the difference between different types of labour market programs, and the fact that they all play a role in getting people employable and in a situation where they can be out there competing in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overwhelmingly the key issue, in my view, in youth unemployment is the issue which relates to overall unemployment&mdash;that is, the need for an economy to generate jobs and the circumstances that are there with respect to government policy on the role in which government can assist the private sector and facilitate, through its own funding, employment growth within an economy. I think there is much more that can be done in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the question of the education sector there are also some issues there around the question of funding. The recent debate and changes on the question of fees et cetera in the tertiary education sector have implications here. Often when you are talking to young people the situation is that the hopelessness that exists in terms of their concerns about their likely employability also relates to the question of their education. What is very clear is that education, the generation of skills generally through a structured environment, is a key component in making young people&mdash;or any person, for that matter&mdash;employable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, as it appears to be becoming more difficult to be in a situation to gain those skills or more expensive to gain those skills, people will make choices. Often they will be making the wrong choice, but they will be making the choice on the basis of the world as they see it. And there are some issues there, too, in terms of ensuring that people make the best of their skills in terms of developing those skills with respect to actually going forth and becoming employable and therefore competing out there in the market. I will leave it at that for now because I was not scheduled to speak. I commend the report to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing a report on a seminar on ANZUS after 45 years that was conducted by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. It was a two&hyphen;day seminar held in Parliament House on 11 and 12 August this year. I found the two days fascinating, not only because of the quality of the speakers&mdash;there was a whole range of speakers; it was opened by the then newly arrived United States ambassador, and there was a range of speakers there from the academic side, the diplomatic side and the political side&mdash;but because they put forward for me very much a historical context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We so often talk about ANZUS&mdash;and we talk about it as part of our foreign policy&mdash;but it was interesting to listen to some of the speakers and to have them give their various points of view not only on the historical perspective of how the alliance came into being but also on periods when the alliance was under some degree of strain or under some degree of consideration.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12014">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who drew on his experience as a former Minister for Defence, brought a perspective to it, as indeed did the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) from his perspective also as a former Minister for Defence at a period when the greatest strain came to that alliance because of the then Labour Party view in New Zealand about the banning of ships. They argued that whether or not they were nuclear powered they would not be admitted&mdash;and that put tremendous strains on the alliance. Indeed, it was very interesting to hear those two gentlemen's perspectives on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the parliament plays a role in bringing together groups like this for seminars. Another subject we debated in this chamber a couple of weeks ago on youth suicide was the result of a seminar which brought a whole lot of people to the parliament for discussions. I thought that this ANZUS treaty seminar, which brought together politicians, diplomats and academics to discuss issues, was also reflective. So often we respond to issues of immediacy&mdash;and a good example of that is the current currency crisis in Asia. We, as members of parliament, are expected to explain to our branch members exactly what is going on. Our families ask us and we have to give them an explanation. Indeed, sometimes the media even asks backbenchers to explain it, and we also have to explain it to our constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When these things come up, they often catch us by surprise&mdash;suddenly this bank is collapsing or this security house is going under in Japan or some other economy is under great pressure. We have to make an immediate response as does the government of the day. This seminar was interesting because I was able to put it into an historical context and to understand better this element of our foreign affairs policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is known, the treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States was signed by the representatives of its member states on 1 September 1991 and ratified on 29 April 1992. It is true&mdash;and this was a point that Des Ball and other people made during the seminar&mdash;that it has been a central pillar in Australia's national security policy over the last 45 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During that period, the United States has been Australia's most important ally&mdash;more important, one suspects, to Australia than to the United States. It is true also that the world in which we and the United States operate today is a very different world from what it was when this alliance first came into being. Just as the foundations that bought the alliance into being have changed, so have the conditions under which we exist today. Over the years, there have been tensions in the alliance, as I said before, not least the period when the nuclear powered ships did not visit New Zealand. Some people, during the seminar, suggested that the New Zealanders were perhaps not paying their way. New Zealand has always been in a very fortunate situation in some respects in regard to defence. It is a long way from anywhere and some people say that, to get to New Zealand, if there was going to be a conflict, you would have to come across Australia first. In many respects&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="GRIFFIN" NAMEID="VU5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VU5">Mr Griffin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But most of them are in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true too. In many respects, New Zealand can afford the luxury of not making a significant contribution to a defence budget, knowing that other countries in the vicinity could protect her on the way. As I said, it was very interesting to hear the various speakers. ANZUS is still basically a defence treaty. Anything to do with defence has got to deal with a whole lot of other issues, including the environment and the economic situation. These issues have caused a very changing world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I gleaned out of those two days that the state of the alliance was good. It has stood the test of time and has provided a framework for cooperation in many areas. There are exchange 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12015"> visits, exchange assignments, ship visits and joint exercises. I particularly congratulate those who organised the seminar and those who participated in it. As I have said, it is very important that we have more of these seminars. Despite the generous words of the ambassador, I am not sure that the United States sees this treaty in the same light as Australia does. I am not sure that it is a cornerstone of United States foreign policy. Being the most powerful nation in the world, the United States has many important alliances&mdash;for instance, its relationship with Japan and China. To Australia though, it is important and it has been an important alliance. I think we have played our part well and there has always been a very bipartisan approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some tensions within sections of the Labor Party about this, and I thought that that was dealt with quite well by some of the speakers. There has been a concern by some in the Labor Party&mdash;and there was a concern during the nuclear ships ban from New Zealand&mdash;that the Australian Labor Party should have taken a very similar line. I thought that Mr Beazley summed up very well on that. The point he was making was that the Australian Labor Party has never had a large constituency of pacifists in it. There may be individual pacifist members of the Labor Party, but he said that he did not have to deal with the same point that the New Zealand Labour Party did. I quote what he said during the seminar:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has never been in the Australian Labor Party, at least since World War II, a serious pacifist strand. The argument in the Australian Labor Party has been between the supporters of the American alliances and the supporters of an armed and neutral stance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So he did not have to face the same situation within the Labor Party in Australia that the leaders of the Labour Party in New Zealand had to face. I do not think there is a lot of difference between the parties on the ANZUS alliance. We both see it as very important to Australia and as very much part of our foreign policy, and it will remain there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, I congratulate all those involved in the ANZUS After 45 Years seminar. I thought it was an excellent two days. It brought great credit to the parliament and to those who organised it, and I hope that similar exercises are repeated in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The seminar to which the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has just referred, the ANZUS After 45 Years seminar was, I felt&mdash;as he did&mdash;really quite remarkable. I would like to echo the sentiments of the honourable member for Throsby and thank him for the remarks he made about me. To the others behind it, and to Senator David MacGibbon who is the chair of the relevant committee, I would particularly say, `Well done.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have tried to promote the idea of seminars as being a valid extension of committees and, in this committee and our four subcommittees, we have had some excellent seminars. Obviously, you have got to put them in balance, but part of their purpose, as I see it, is to bring the people from the wider community into contact with parliamentarians, to allow a dialogue not only between them and parliamentarians but also between often disparate parties, so that they can have some opportunity of meeting others in a different forum where they can actually give us some idea of how they see each other's perspective. As a result, we parliamentarians are seen as being far more relevant in the current debate. Certainly, in this seminar and in a number of others, that has worked extraordinarily successfully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ANZUS is obviously a topic which has been a sleeper, if you like, in our defence and foreign policy issues for some years now. It is not something that many understand. It is not a subject which has necessarily a high profile in the debate within this place, although it is quietly there. Certainly, from my experience not only as a Minister for Defence but as a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12016"> member for many years of the cabinet committee on foreign affairs and defence and on issues that pertain to intelligence, I would say that the relationship with the United States has been a very vital one in many ways, as many indirect as direct. The ANZUS seminar looked at where that relationship began&mdash;and really it was all post the middle of World War II&mdash;and at where we go from here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our relationship pre&hyphen;World War II was so subordinate to the United Kingdom and we were so much part of our relationship with the United Kingdom that America was on the sidelines. It was not until 1941 and the Curtin initiatives that Australia really developed a new relationship with the United States. I think that it is important in looking at this seminar that we pick some of that out, and I would like to do so in the few minutes that are available to me, and then look at where we go from here. There were a few very important issues that emerged from that that are very significant in determining where Australia's position is in the world today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very glad that the honourable member for Throsby, Mr Hollis, referred to the situation in New Zealand. We have a funny relationship with New Zealand. I must admit that the longer I am in politics, the less I pretend to understand it&mdash;and perhaps I understand New Zealanders even less. The difficulty is that we are so similar and yet we are so unalike. There are so many areas where our relationship with the Kiwis is fundamental.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad Larry Anthony, the member for Richmond, is in the House. Larry's father and I were very much involved in CER&mdash;Doug was far more involved in CER than I was. I was very much involved in its predecessor which was another NAFTA. When people talk about NAFTA today, of course they think of the North American Free Trade Association. But we had a New Zealand Australia free trade association which we called NAFTA before CER came into being and because each of us was in a different role at different times, New Zealanders were trying to fight Australian primary producers, particularly in Tasmania&mdash;and we do not have a Tasmanian in the House at the moment. But when we first started talking to the Kiwis, I had no idea that Tasmania and New Zealand saw themselves almost as enemies in everything they produced. They are very similar in characteristics because climatically they are akin to each other more than to anybody else, but we had hell's own job trying to persuade Tasmanian farmers that there was any point in getting into bed with New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, wearing another hat I have at the moment in this constitutional convention, we are in that extraordinary position where New Zealand is named in our constitution. If you look at the definitions, New Zealand is part of the Australian constitution. We need to remember that until 1898 it looked as if New Zealand would be a member of the Australian federation, and Western Australia would not. So in looking at the ANZUS relationships, which is what this seminar is about, we need to remember that time has moved on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Western Australians are occasionally here, but I am not always sure that they always want to be part of the federation either. But as far as New Zealand is concerned, it is not part of the federation. It has been part of ANZUS but it is not at the moment. We are part of the common defence relationship which is a counterpart to the common economic relationship. But from Australia's point of view we have always looked on the ANZAC tradition as being not peculiarly Australian, but including the New Zealanders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one goes, as I was fortunate to do only a month or so ago, to the Sinai to see the MFO there, the New Zealanders and the Australians have the same recreation area. It is the Annzac Cove recreation area&mdash;Australian Norwegian New Zealand. While I know that my 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12017"> colleague on the other side recalls some other instance that occurred that night, it is true that one forgets that that New Zealand Australian relationship at a personal level is always very competitive but very close. We take each other for granted and, as one who could probably speak a little bit out of turn, I would hope that New Zealand does become part of the Australian federation in some way for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that my Labor colleagues will say that that will make sure that we will never have one central government, that New Zealand would never accept that it should be only government representing Australia and New Zealand, from my point even it does mean preserving the states&mdash;and I think that no longer since I became a centralist having seen the way Australia is governed&mdash;I think that there is reason for New Zealand to become part of our federation. It would overcome one of the problems which was identified in this seminar and that is the fact that New Zealand is no longer part of ANZUS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to talk for long, but I wanted to say a few things, firstly, about the genesis of ANZUS. Those people who worry and wonder about what the Australian&hyphen;American relationship used to be, I thoroughly commend to you the paper by Dr Peter Edwards, `History of ANZUS agreement'. It is a fascinating read; it was an excellent presentation. He took us back to the world as it was at the end of World War II. I know that generations have moved on and people say, `That was yesterday.' But frankly, it is extraordinarily important that people understand that part of the strength of Australia as we move into the 21st century is that the relationship with the United States was developed in quite extraordinary circumstances during the second half of the 20th century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put on record a few extracts from Peter Edwards's paper, because it is well worth remembering. First, Peter Edwards says of the ANZUS agreement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was nothing inevitable about it. ANZUS was created by a tiny group of politicians&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And it was tiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and officials in Canberra, Wellington and Washington against considerable resistance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Everybody thought it was nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of World War II, the United States was very much the victor. Japan was in ruins, Germany was in ruins&mdash;all Europe was in ruins. They had been fighting each other for 100 years and had only just managed to battle through. It was extraordinary that a little country like Australia and an even smaller country like New Zealand were able to persuade the Americans and particularly the American Congress to adopt an ANZUS treaty, which gave us, for all that they were a bit nebulous, the agreements to commit each to the support of the other in circumstances that have been very important in the subsequent 50 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Peter Edwards continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the outset ANZUS did not have the almost unanimous support that it subsequently had&mdash;or appeared to have&mdash;amongst the relevant elites. I have referred to the United States military, but they were not the only ones who were uneasy. The Australian military leadership at this time was oriented far more towards London than towards Washington.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He continues a little later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of the negotiation of ANZUS, the British Labour government under Clement Attlee reluctantly accepted British exclusion. Shortly after its signing, Winston Churchill and the Conservatives returned to office and tried vigorously to reopen the issue. Churchill even accused Richard Casey&mdash;Casey, of all people&mdash;of being `an apostate to the Empire' for failing to support Britain's inclusion. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12018">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It really is quite extraordinary. Today, Britain has withdrawn from everywhere east of Suez. Britain's role in this part of the world is now largely represented by its continuing relationship with Pitcairn Island and I think there are about 30 or 40 people on Pitcairn Island. They have just returned to the South Pacific Commission, but that was because they suddenly realised withdrawal was not necessarily in their long&hyphen;term best interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say all that with good heart, because I am a person who strongly supports British involvement in the five&hyphen;power defence arrangements and, hopefully, in an ongoing fraternal relationship with Australia but they are from another place. The point about that genesis and Peter Edwards's comments though was that he has spoken of the rather unique way in which ANZUS was formed. Another paper, which is included as an annex to the seminar report, was presented by Professor Desmond Ball of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre of the ANU. It is appendix 6 of the report. I commend those who are interested in the subject to it and there are a couple of aspects of his conclusions that I think are very relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Desmond Ball said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current transition in the Australia&hyphen;US security relationship is very complex, and in the context of enhanced multilateralism in South&hyphen;East Asia involves sensitive judgments, hard choices and careful balances. At the most general level, there is a need for a careful balance between the elements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And that was the point I think is particularly significant:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of self&hyphen;reliance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which we assert, but which frankly we are unable to implement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the US alliance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which is closer in military affairs than it is trade affairs where we are always fighting with Congress about the extent to which they have these all-American laws or the degree to which they want to apply extraterritorial jurisdiction, as a result of the passage of legislation in the United States. Continuing in Desmond Ball's words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and other bilateral and multilateral security arrangements in Australia's national security policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is this need for a very fine balance. He says a little later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Balance and sensitivity are especially necessary with respect to Australia's efforts to commit the US to the region.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is particularly relevant to the statement made by the Minister for Defence, Mr McLachlan, yesterday regarding Australia's strategic projection of the future and forward cooperation. It is also very relevant to the white paper produced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, with respect to Australia's defence policy in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need to do is to have ongoing dialogue, not just talking across the chambers&mdash;whether the Main Committee or the main House&mdash;with respect to treaties of this character. We do need to involve outsiders. We need to look at the origins of these treaties and the way in which they evolve and recognise that, in the instance at least with ANZUS, we have been able to establish something that has incredible durability, that has given us quite phenomenal access in ways that would never otherwise be possible with the world's only superpower, and yet allows us to tell them when we disagree, where we disagree and why we disagree. That to me is a very important part of Australia being an independent sovereign power and one able to play a reasonable role in developing a more independent stance in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we go into the 21st century, it is important that we are self&hyphen;sufficient. It is important that we do not kowtow to anybody. But it is also important that we do it cooperatively, and not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12019"> just with our great and powerful friends, but with our regional neighbours and with those who are further afield. It seems to me that being able to do so with those other countries gives us greater force and influence with the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United States is such an enormous country in its own right. People get myopic about their own concerns. One of the figures that has always stuck in my memory about the United States is that 10 per cent of the United States GDP represents 40 per cent of that of the rest of the world. That is really quite phenomenal. When you think of the size of the world trade and the world economy, 10 per cent of the United States economy represents 40 per cent of that of the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our committee this morning had a fascinating briefing by the German ambassador to China about the growth of China. Of course, power balances change and new countries come into being. The significance for Australia is that we do have this ongoing relationship with the United States. It is not a subservient relationship; it is a meaningful one. It does require delicate balance in trying to assert our responsibilities as well as our rights. But this seminar did provide us with a very good understanding of where it was, how it began and where it is going. I would like to commend all those who participated and, in particular, thank those who came from so far to speak to us on that day.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the right honourable gentleman who preceded me, the member for New England (Mr Sinclair), I am very pleased to talk, albeit briefly, on this seminar. I regret that I was not able to attend this seminar personally. I want to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr Sinclair for the initiative in setting up these seminars. It is something that the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is trying in this parliament. I think it has been successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I chaired the inaugural seminar, which was into the Papua New Guinea relationship. I take the opportunity also to congratulate Senator David MacGibbon who chaired this one. Subsequently we had one on the role of the Commonwealth. I hope next year we will develop one on Cambodia. I think Cambodia is about to go through an interesting phase and it would be appropriate for us to have a seminar. There will be more on that, hopefully, in 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was appropriate also that this seminar be held in the 45th year of ANZUS. It is, as previous speakers have said, an alliance&mdash;and I emphasise alliance rather than treaty. It was very appropriate that we talk about it at this point, because it is fundamental to our strategic setting and&mdash;as the right honourable gentleman has indicated&mdash;something that was reflected and reinforced in yesterday's strategic policy statement by the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to see a couple of perspectives in terms of what this alliance is all about. I am going to take the opportunity to read into the record&mdash;I would like to read a lot more into the record because it was a very good seminar&mdash;some of the specific comments and, hopefully, people can digest them in due course. The first comment, in terms of perspectives, is from our own Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who, in an address in New York earlier this year, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's close association with the United States has underpinned not only our security but also our stability, but most importantly it has given us the opportunity to share values across the Pacific, to share those fundamental beliefs of personal liberty, of individual effort, of a just society and a belief that it is appropriate always to aspire to the ideal of a better world. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12020">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think it is important that we not only reinforce the bilateral or inadequate trilateral basis of this alliance but that we recognise that it has an impact in regional terms, quite beyond the bilateral relationship that exists between the United States and Australia in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also interesting to read what the US Ambassador, Mrs Holmes, had to say at the seminar on the same subject. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With ANZUS as a keystone, Australia and the United States have a mature relationship based on shared experience and shared expectations. It is rather like a good marriage. We have a deep affection for each other, we agree on almost everything, we are mutually supportive and we manage to work through the small differences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of those differences have not been altogether small.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have been through a lot during the life of ANZUS&mdash;Korea, Vietnam, some trade disputes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and that, I suspect, is putting it mildly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Zealand's anti&hyphen;nuclear laws.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They were referred to by the member for Throsby. Mrs Holmes continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Together we have participated in the successful negotiations of the protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Nuclear non&hyphen;proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She finished by saying that `the partnership works.' I agree with her, in general terms. Having lived in the United States for four or five years, I would say that if you make good friends around the world, and you make a good friend in the United States, that friend is closer, in my experience, than anybody else. I recognise the strong relationship that exists between our two countries at the social level as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is difficult to pick out the better presentations given at the seminar but I thought what I would do, to emphasise the point I made at the opening about the emphasis on alliance rather than treaty, is quote from the presentation by Hugh White. Hugh White, as opposition members would know, has had a long relationship in the defence area. He is currently one of the deputy secretaries in the department. He is a good strategic thinker and he reinforced that in yesterday's announcement and statement by the Minister for Defence on strategic policy. At the seminar, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The alliance is bigger and broader than the treaty, but I think the treaty itself is a very important part of the alliance, for reasons that I want to talk about in more detail in a little while.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have, since 1976, had Australian governments of all persuasions very closely focused on the primary responsibility of Australia to maintain the capabilities to defend our own territory without relying on the combat forces of other countries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nonetheless, I think that even within a self&hyphen;reliant defence posture the fact that such a very powerful country has such a very clearly expressed obligation, with such clear connotation in the context of the treaty and the circumstance under which it was negotiated, that it would involve the use of armed force is a very significant strategic asset to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worth noting that the wording of the treaty is interestingly broad; it is not just attack on our territory it is also attack on our forces in the Pacific area. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12021">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That emphasises the regional ramifications of this particular alliance, and not just the strict bilateral between Australia and the United States or the trilateral with New Zealand, and I think he has made that point well. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So it poses a very significant constraint in the straight military planning of anyone who intended to use armed force against Australia or our armed forces. And let me tell you,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as a working strategic policy maker, that is something that is very good to have in the toolbox.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The right honourable gentleman before me referred also to Professor Des Ball, who is well known to many in this place. He made some interesting comments too. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the 1980s, the important aspects of the relationship from the Australian point of view have been the preferential access to US defence technology, which has been important in maintaining the high technology focus of Australian defence strategy . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That point was emphasised yesterday in the strategic policy statement by the Minister for Defence. Professor Ball continued by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the intelligence cooperation and exchange agreements and the access to the most senior strategic councils in Washington that derives from Australia's hosting of the important satellite early warning and signals intelligence ground stations at Nurrungar and Pine Gap.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has been at the forefront of the moves to enhance and institutionalise confidence&mdash;and security&hyphen;building measures&mdash;. . . and cooperative security activities in this region.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has been one of the most active participants in the ARF.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence activities are at the very forefront of Australia's regional security policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That leads me on to the strategic policy document. I do not have time to read all of the section on the US alliance into the record but I want to read part of it into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  because it is worth reinforcing. It is an important element of this very important policy document. It said on page 18:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our alliance with the United States is by any measure our most important strategic relationship. It is a major strategic asset and its preservation and development is amongst our highest strategic priorities. The alliance is a complex relationship which operates at many levels and in many ways, including annual Ministerial-level consultations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, and most fundamentally, it is a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">bilateral</EMPHASIS>  arrangement. That bilateral aspect involves a vast web of day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day bilateral cooperation in the maintenance and development of our military capabilities, including intelligence cooperation, access to some of the most advanced military technologies, and intense service&hyphen;to&hyphen;service contact through training, exercises and visits. This cooperation provides Australia's forces with technology and information which is fundamental to our defence capability. It will become more important in future as we become even more dependent on exploiting technology&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">a point made very strongly in this document in terms of the technology edge&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">especially information technology&mdash;to maximise our capabilities.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, it makes the commitment of US combat forces to our defence sufficiently likely to figure in the calculations of any would&hyphen;be aggressor. Nevertheless, we do not <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">assume</EMPHASIS>  that such help would be provided. Indeed, such an assumption would be inconsistent with out self-reliant posture and our alliance obligations. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12022">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In one specific respect the alliance does provide a clear expectation of US support&mdash;that is, defence against nuclear attack. While the risk of nuclear attack on Australia remains very low, the possibility cannot entirely be ruled out. In those circumstances we would rely on the extended deterrence provided by the United States to deter such an attack.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This regional focus&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">a point that I have also referred to earlier&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has always been part of the relationship. It is explicit in the ANZUS Treaty itself, which obliges each party to help the other in the event of either coming under attack in the Pacific area. But for both parties the regional aspect has become more significant in recent years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I agree entirely with that point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as the US&hyphen;Australia alliance has come to be seen by both sides as an important element in the post&hyphen;Cold War strategic architecture in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, helping to sustain US strategic engagement in the Western Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It finishes this particular section, on the alliance, by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the relationship is presently sound, we need to be active in managing the alliance and careful to avoid drift and complacency. The challenges in alliance management over the next few years will include sustaining our miliary capacity to operate with the United States by investing in necessary systems, and exploring new forms of practical cooperation&mdash;for example in the collaborative development of new systems and platforms.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I said at the outset, this is a very, very important alliance. It is fundamental to our security in this region. It is fundamental to many dimensions of our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing to note at the various levels, whether they be in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or within the Department of Defence, that the relationship has been strengthened and enhanced under the present government. We have seen a number of measures, a lot of ministerial talks, carried out, both in the defence and the foreign affairs and trade areas and at the official level. It is pleasing to see the impact of those discussions in a wider regional sense, with officials proceeding to other countries in the Pacific rim, as a supplementation to this very important alliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing to be able to talk to this record of the seminar proceedings. It was a very important seminar. I hope it will not be the last; I am sure it will not be the last. As I indicated in the main chamber last night, I get disappointed at times when some of these issues in strategic terms are not debated in this chamber or, indeed, in the other chamber to the depth that they should be. Giving the opportunity to members to debate this sort of report enhances that capacity. I commend the report of proceedings to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) It is common procedure for Departments to request job applicants to provide multiple copies of their application documents, however, if only one copy of an application is received, the applicant is not required to provide further copies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) There is no legislative requirement for job applicants to provide multiple copies of their applications. I am not advised of any Department requiring up to five copies, however, it is common practice for Departments to request applications to be submitted in triplicate. This is for ease in processing applications and enables the efficient distribution of applications to the Selection Advisory Committee (usually comprising three members).</PARA>

Self help facilities are also available for applicants who are participating in job clubs. Job clubs are now part of the Job Seeker Preparation and Support Program&mdash;JPS. Post job club support for up to 13 weeks is provided to people who do not find employment during the program and this would normally include access to self help facilities, including the use of photocopiers. JPS, SkillShare and case management arrangements cease on 30 April 1998, however, a trial of self help facilities is planned to commence shortly, which will inform the process of establishing self help facilities at Centrelink outlets from 1 May 1998.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following information in response to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) No. The preamble to the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Act 1995 states that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund was established to help redress the dispossession of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders. Section 191B of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 provides that the purposes of the Indigenous Land Corporation are to assist Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to acquire and to manage land so as to provide economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">association with a particular area of land a qualification for land acquisition using monies sourced from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. Indeed, the Indigenous Land Corporation's National Indigenous Land Strategy states (page 5) that, wherever possible, the Indigenous Land Corporation will aim to ensure that traditional owners (or people with traditional links to the land) become the holders of the relevant title. That Strategy was tabled in the House of Representatives in March 1997 as required by Section 191N(7) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) Yes. While the Indigenous Land Corporation's policy is flexible and decisions on individual proposals are made after assessment of those proposals against the criteria set down in the National Indigenous Land Strategy, the Corporation' s Strategy (page 5) states, as a general proposition, that "the ILC will give priority to land where a native title claim has not been lodged, and where it is unlikely that a native title claim would be successful. Consideration will also be given to other land fights mechanisms available to assist indigenous people to regain their land."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A successful native title claim may not, however, deliver to the successful claimants an interest approaching full, beneficial ownership of land (as, for example, in the case of pastoral leases, where a determination of native title fights and interests will be subject to the fights of the pastoral lessee). Their land needs will, in such cases, still need to be addressed and access to resources from the Aboriginal and Tortes Strait Islander Land Fund is a legitimate avenue for addressing those needs. Moreover, land of especial cultural significance to a particular group of claimants may not be claimable at common law or under the Native Title Act 1993 (because, for example, the land is freehold). Access to the Land Fund also provides these claimants with a legitimate avenue for addressing their land needs.</PARA>
