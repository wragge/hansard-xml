<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During question time yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition asked me a number of questions relating to the Australian Law Reform Commission's draft report on the Native Title Amendment Bill. As I advised the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, I first knew of this matter when I read the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the other questions raised by the Leader of the Opposition, to which I said I would check my records and speak to my staff, I am advised that Mr Hugh Funder, chief of staff to the Attorney&hyphen;General, spoke with Mr Tony Nutt, my principal private secretary, and Mrs Catherine Murphy, one of my senior advisers, on Friday, 19 September. I am told that Mr Funder advised that he had been informed that the ALRC had prepared a draft report which it was proposing to present to the joint parliamentary committee on native title. Mr Funder also noted that the ALRC's actions appeared to be inconsistent with a recent letter which the Attorney&hyphen;General had sent to Mr Rose to the effect that the Attorney be consulted on matters on which the ALRC proposed to comment where there was no specific reference to it from the Attorney&hyphen;General. It was suggested that the Attorney&hyphen;General should address the matter in light of his letter to Mr Rose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been informed that no staff member of my office spoke with the Attorney&hyphen;General, staff of his department or staff at the ALRC, on the matter. I have also been informed that no action was taken by staff in my office in relation to whether or not the ALRC's proposed presentation of the submission to the joint parliamentary committee should proceed.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VT4">Mr REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Prime Minister. Given the immense importance of small business to the economic and social health of Australia, can the Prime Minister outline to the House how the government has addressed small business needs? Will the Prime Minister assure the House that this government will continue to improve the lot of small business and, therefore, the entire nation, reversing Labor's neglect of this job generator?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like, first of all, to congratulate the member for Bendigo on the really first&hyphen;class job he did in chairing the committee that produced the report on fair trading. As has already been foreshadowed by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the government will outline this afternoon a very comprehensive, a very reformist and, I believe, a very fair response to the report that has been brought down by the committee chaired by the member for Bendigo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that the small business sector is vital to Australia's economic future. In the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8742"> decade to 1994&hyphen;95 it generated 1.1 million jobs. Unlike the arrogance of my predecessor, who told small business that this is a good as it ever got, it has got a lot better since March 1996. Interest rates have come down by 2&half; per cent; provisional tax burdens have been reduced by $180 million. We went much further than we promised in the election in providing capital gains tax relief. We have made it easier to build new and larger businesses. We have responded very positively to the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, including a package costing more than $600 million over a four&hyphen;year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, we have significantly reformed in a quite far&hyphen;reaching way the workplace relations conditions applying to small business. I notice that the opposition spokesman for small business is nodding his assent. Well may he nod his assent because we have, in fact, brought in a new era for the small business community; and I can say that my colleague this afternoon will add to the store of measures which are of positive benefit to the small business community of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I simply make a final contrast: in the 13 years that Labor was in power it had 17 reports on small business and did nothing. We have received two. We have acted on the first one and we will be acting on the second one this afternoon.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XU5">Mr LIEBERMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, will you assure the House that the opportunity to act on called for reform for the benefit of small business in Australia will not be lost as has occurred so often with past Labor governments?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="8742" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Workplace Relations and Small Business" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Indi for his question. I certainly can give him that assurance. We will be acting on the Reid committee recommendations. We will be doing so comprehensively, in fact bringing down a statement the likes of which has not been seen for more than 20 years in this country in delivering a strong and comprehensive response to that particular report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the Leader of the Opposition has today claimed credit for what we are doing, which is really quite incredible when you think of the differences between them and us on this issue. The Prime Minister referred to the 17 reports that Labor had which led to nothing during Labor's years; and what an incredible tally they are. Labor came into office in 1983 promising to look after small business and they got a report in 1984 and did nothing. In 1986 they introduced a bill and did nothing. Again in 1986 they had an exposure draft on franchise and did nothing. In 1986 they had a second exposure draft and did nothing. In 1987 they had a ministerial council meeting and they abandoned the draft that they introduced in 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then in 1989 they had a House of Representatives committee and a discussion paper from the Trade Practices Commission. In 1990 they got really busy about small business, so they had a House of Representatives committee again, they had a discussion paper from the Trade Practices Commission and they had a government response. They were so good at doing nothing they decided to do it all again in 1991. They called for a report. Then they had another report from a Senate committee. Then they thought, `No, we have had reports. We have had reviews. We have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8743"> had discussion papers. It is time for something new, something different, something powerful for small business.' They had a task force. That was in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then they went quiet. Then they sat back. They rested on their laurels. They had done nothing, absolutely nothing. Then in 1994 they got Bob Gardini to do a review and they did nothing. In 1995, as we headed towards the 1996 election, once again they lifted the pace and the tempo of their great policy development and they had a report by a working party, a supplementary report and we ended up with yet another discussion paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of it, after 13 years, they did nothing with 17 reports. And the Leader of the Opposition has the gall to stand up and say, `If only we had been re-elected in 1996 we finally would have done something about it.' In fact two years after they introduced one change to the Trade Practices Act they themselves were then fiddling around with their better business conduct bill which they introduced in the last week of the parliament before the 1996 election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I can say to small business people in this country is that this afternoon we will introduce reforms, amendments to the Trade Practices Act, which will give it real teeth for the protection of the small business community. Our package of reforms will introduce some real change in the behaviour of businesses to the benefit of small business. We will ensure that the ACCC has the capacity and the resources to undertake its enforcement role on behalf of small business. It is time for action. Our response to the fair trading report built on our existing track record of development and improvement for this sector. Above all, we want a new deal, a fair deal, for small business.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought you might have called equal time for the other people. My question is again directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Can the minister confirm that he claimed 38 capital city travelling allowance days in the first six months of financial year 1996-97. Yet his annual return only shows 37 capital city days for the whole year. Given that none of the corrections referred to in the Prime Minister's statement of 24 September involving the minister's repayment of $1,710 referred to misclaimed capital city days, how does the minister explain a negative capital city claim record for his second six months? Minister, are you saying that you claimed no capital cities from 1 January to 30 June 1997? If so, where have you been, Minister?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<ANSWER PAGE="8744" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Workplace Relations and Small Business" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for McEwen for her question. I also publicly congratulate and thank her for her contribution to the Reid committee report. It was a team effort. One of the great things about the 1996 election was that elected into this place were a lot of people who knew about small business. Tremendous from the point of view of the small business community is that a lot of these people&mdash;the member for McEwen, of course, is in the resurrection club&mdash;came into the parliament to give the perspective of the small business community so we could do a decent deal for the small business community. So I do thank her for her contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the terms of reference for that committee were drafted&mdash;and I also take the opportunity of commenting upon the tremendous work done by my predecessor as the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, the member for Forrest, in getting this under way&mdash;we in fact included a reference to the franchising sector because we wanted those business conduct issues in the franchising sector examined in detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that when this government came into power in March 1996 we inherited Labor's failed voluntary code of conduct for the franchising sector. That was their preferred approach in government: basically to leave small business to the goodwill of big business. Of course, true to form, they have a very different view now that they are in opposition. It is interesting that, when they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were in government, they received a report from Canberra consultant Mr Robert Gardini which reviewed the operation and effectiveness of the franchising code of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his report of October 1994 to the then small business minister, Senator Schacht, Mr Gardini referred to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the present standards of conduct provisions to address serious franchise problems.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to recommend a mandatory code. What did the Labor government then do? They ignored that advice and they continued with their flawed voluntary code of conduct for franchising. The hypocrisy of Labor never ceases to amaze me. They even had the hide to criticise us for running with their franchising model pending the outcome of the fair trading inquiry. The Leader of the Opposition now has, as I said earlier, the hide to suggest that we are doing and responding to Labor's position. You had an opportunity at the very latest in 1994 to respond to the Gardini committee and you failed to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We accept the fair trading inquiry's assessment that Labor's franchising model&mdash;the self&hyphen;regulatory approach&mdash;has simply not worked. We will ensure that, for the first time, franchisees have the protection that they need. Our approach will have teeth, it will have the force of law&mdash;something the opposition never had the gumption to do when they were in government. The message I pass on to franchisees who are getting a raw deal is that, in the statement to be made by me this afternoon outlining the government's response to the fair trading committee report, we will respond to their plea for help and we will deliver on the fair trading recommendations.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is just another smear campaign. There was an attempt at that in the upper house yesterday. And I will answer one of the questions raised yesterday. This is just another smear campaign which was tried in the upper house yesterday when Senator Faulkner stood up in the Senate and said that I was in Townsville and yet I claimed in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me detail that question and my answer to that smear campaign by Senator Faulkner yesterday. In relation to 17 June, I can confirm that I was in Townsville to address the Queensland RSL Congress. I flew on a commercial air service, QF 649/679, from Townsville to Canberra that evening, arriving at 8.50 p.m. I consequently spent that night in Canberra as it was a parliamentary sitting week.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The booking indicated the car would be picked up and returned to Parramatta. The formal brief&mdash;and I dare say I will be asked to table it, so I will read from it so you might be aware of it&mdash;had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The investigation has centred around the date of the by-election for Lindsay, which was held on 19 October 1996. The Ministerial and Parliamentary Services, MAPS, processes car hire invoices on the basis that there has been an approved authorised booking made by a senator or a member. Invoices were forwarded to MAPS by Dasfleet. Simultaneously, a copy would be referred to the senator or member for the certification to MAPS. An invoice would be paid unless it was clearly outside the terms of the entitlement. There is no record of a payment authorisation from the Leader of the Opposition in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of each month, the management report is referred to the minister or office holder which details the travel undertaken. This gives the opportunity for an office to raise questions in respect of any payment made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the Leader of the Opposition, staff need to be authorised to use self-drive vehicles for official purposes. This is detailed in the office holders' entitlement issued by David Jull, the Minister for Administrative Services, following clearance by the Prime Minister's office in March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The relevant clause is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Self-drive cars: when travelling on official duty, staff may also use short-term self-drive cars hired through Dasfleet, provided that the hire is for no more than 10 days duration. Self&hyphen;drive cars may not be used in Canberra or in the city where the member's or the minister's state or electorate office is located. This administrative arrangement is identical to that in operation under the former government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then it gave me the details, which I have already quoted. The car was in fact booked for a short period but was retained for a larger period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this does raise quite significant questions for the Leader of the Opposition, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and I would like to pose a couple of them to him. Why was the car leased for more than twice the period that was allowed? Was it used for official business or was it used for electioneering on behalf of the ALP? Why were no queries made about the Commonwealth making the payment? Have there been any other irregularities in the leader's accounts? These are questions that the leader himself has to deal with. He cannot shrug it off, and I think it needs to be said that he should follow his own injunction: if Labor people are rorting, Labor people should go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand from the invoice that the staff member involved is a Miss Horne. I understand she is an assistant adviser to Mr Beazley on his staff here in Canberra, and I understand she did not take leave during the relevant period.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. I welcome his interest in economic issues. It is certainly an interest you would never find from the opposition in this parliament. You would never get a serious question on the economy from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the government and the public will welcome the fact that Australian 10-year bonds and US 10-year bonds now have a spread of practically zero. The last time there was a narrow spread of the dimension that currently exists between the US 10-year bond and the Australian 10-year bond was in 1980. It has never occurred since financial deregulation in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of March 1996, yields in Australia were 8.8 per cent, compared with 6.7 per cent over 200 basis points, or two per cent. Now, after the coalition's period in office of 18 months, they are practically the same. That means there is now no premium for borrowing long term in relation to Australian bonds. That is a reflection of an expectation of inflation. Financial markets now believe that Australia not only has low inflation but has low inflation locked in and locked in for the long term. This signals Australia's return to the ranks of the low inflation countries of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, over the last 12 months, the coalition government has been able to do something Labor never could&mdash;sustain growth whilst inflation was actually falling. We have got inflation under control whilst sustaining growth now at the three&hyphen;plus percentage points in relation to GDP. Not only does this reflect the government's fiscal policy of taking that deficit that the Labor Party had built up and turning it over the course of one 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliamentary term into a surplus; it also indicates the conduct of monetary policy by which the government, in an agreement with the Reserve Bank, set out a transparent monetary policy to give people confidence in Australia's inflation prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like all of the government's economic reforms, that reform was opposed by the Labor Party. The Labor Party opposed an inflation target set by agreement between the Reserve Bank and the government and threatened to sue us over it. One idea the Labor Party had in relation to inflation was to get it up along with interest rates. It had no economic policy whatsoever&mdash;none whatsoever. No strategy to lock in low inflation, no strategy to engage in fiscal consolidation, no strategy in relation to interest rates, no strategy in relation to growth in a low inflation environment. All we hear is this populism, do nothing, vacuous sound that comes from the opposition, with not one economic idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I was very interested when I heard the member for Hotham talking about the roamer from Roma recently in question time.

The claims of the former minister for transport in relation to travel allowance are now the subject of examination in a most detailed way by the Auditor&hyphen;General of the Commonwealth&mdash;a person that was appointed by the former Labor government. That is a measure of accountability, that is a measure of examination, that is a measure of transparency that you could not even dream about. The last person on the front bench opposite who can ask questions about ministerial probity is the shadow minister for foreign affairs. You were prepared to sit and endorse all of the actions that were taken by the other ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question asked by the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith gives me the opportunity to supplement an answer that was given by the Acting Minister for Administrative Services to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8749"> enormous contribution that Vincent has made to the Liberal Party of Australia over a long period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had the opportunity of investigating the question that was asked by the Leader of the Opposition.

That is the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now let me take the opportunity of contrasting that with the disgraceful behaviour of my opposite number, the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has to explain to the Australian people how he has allowed a member of his staff, apparently outside of entitlement, to use a privately plated, self&hyphen;hired motor vehicle for 22 days during an election campaign when plainly that staff member has not been engaged on the official business of the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a clear&hyphen;cut difference in standards: you have Woolcock who is working in the Government Members Secretariat and who, according to my information, has gone on leave without pay and the lady in question in your office who did not go on leave without pay. She continued to be paid by the taxpayer, even though, through the duration of that 22&hyphen;day period, she was not working for you but working for the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is whom she was working for, and everybody in this parliament knows that. What Vincent has done and what we have done, according to my advice from the federal director of the party, is absolutely the right thing. He has gone on leave without pay, and all the expense involved is being borne&mdash;as it should be&mdash;by the South Australian division of the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also inform the House that I have been told by my Principal Private Secretary, Mr Nutt, who at the time of the Lindsay by&hyphen;election&mdash;the very successful time of the Lindsay by&hyphen;election&mdash;was the state director of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party, that there was at least one person who worked in the Government Members Secretariat here in Canberra who worked in that by&hyphen;election campaign, but that person also took leave without pay from the Government Members Secretariat and that person's salary was paid by the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts from both sides of the chamber on their report, and in particular the chair of the committee, the member for Fairfax. The report is, as one would expect, a very thorough and professional report. It makes a number of very sensible suggestions for improving the bill or the subordinate legislation. None of these recommendations, so far as I am able to determine on my first read through, affect, the fundamental integrity of the bill that the government has put before the House, and I believe that many of the recommendations of the committee have merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee supported the need for the present legislation to be replaced and favoured simplification and modification of the legislation governing the Public Service, as the new bill does. Indeed, most of the witnesses before the committee saw that the 1922 act was in need of desperate overhaul. I want to record the fact that this bill that the government has brought forward is the culmination of many years of work on Public Service reform. I acknowledge the work by the previous government as well as by many leaders of the Public Service itself. The bill is not a partisan piece of legislation. It is a bill designed to put in place a framework for the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8751"> Public Service of this country which will enable it to serve, in an outstanding way, governments of all persuasions over the decades ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Public Service is a key institution in Australian democracy and both sides of this chamber have an interest in ensuring that the framework within which the Public Service operates is a framework that will enable it to be a high performance, best practice organisation. The challenge for the Labor Party coming out of this report is to recognise the fact that the bill before the House is one which reflects views which have been expressed on both sides of this chamber.

The first is that I would have to check with others before I could give a precise answer to the first question, because the decision about tabling, as I recall it, followed a question that you asked&mdash;if I remember correctly&mdash;of the former Minister for Administrative Services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in this area. The honourable member is referring to the Immunise Australia initiative that we announced in February this year. Over the next 12 to 18 months we can expect a number of new and quite exciting vaccines to be coming on the market, and I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the government has made the decision to fund the first of these which is an acellular pertussis vaccine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Children get protection from diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough by a series of vaccines, firstly at two, four and six months of age, boosters at 12 months, and a final one at four to five years&hyphen;of&hyphen;age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two types of vaccines that do this. The first is called DTPw, which is the whole cell vaccine, and then DTPa, which is the acellular vaccine. The whole cell vaccine is safe and effective, but it does lead to reactions in a small proportion of children, such as local irritation, swelling, and sometimes a mild fever. The acellular vaccine has a much lower rate of local reaction. It is, however, much more expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has decided to make this generally available for the boosters for children at 18 months of age and four to five years of age&mdash;also, to any children in the primary course at two, four and six months of age who have a reaction. It can then be expected to have a lower rate of reaction in any subsequent injections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking to the future, there are now vaccines in development that we expect to come on board in the next year which will protect against more diseases at the one time. Particularly, we will be able protect against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and probably hepatitis B and haemophilus influenza type B 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8753"> at the one time, so a child will be getting an injection that protects against five different childhood illnesses. As this will require fewer injections in the immunisation schedule, we would expect, over time, that this would fully replace the existing vaccines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I inform the honourable member that we are not far away from being able to publish the first set of comprehensive immunisation coverage data that will rank immunisation by state and also by local government area within states. I hope that this will be a great incentive for those areas that are not up to scratch to do so, and it will finally put to rest the long&hyphen;term neglect in this area.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in major economic issues like tax reform. On 10 September 1997, Coopers and Lybrand released a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A survey of consumption taxes: a worldwide perspective</EMPHASIS> . Coopers and Lybrand have published similar surveys for the past two years, and the survey covered 167 countries: 143 countries imposed a broad based indirect tax on goods and services; 17 countries did not impose any taxes on spending; and only seven countries imposed a wholesale sales tax or manufacturers tax. One of those countries was Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is the only developed country in the world which imposes a wholesale sales tax. Of the seven countries imposing a wholesale sales tax or manufacturers tax, the other countries&mdash;apart from Australia&mdash;are Botswana, Ghana, Jordan, Pakistan, the Solomon Islands and Swaziland. Unlike Australia, some of these countries also tax services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surveys conclude that Australia's indirect tax base is in urgent need of repair. This is contributed to by the recent High Court decision resulting in the repeal of some state business franchise fees. It is compounded by the majority of indirect taxes which are imposed on a narrow range of goods, and our sales tax collections in Australia apply to business inputs. The survey concludes that this makes our exports more expensive and less competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The case for reforming Australia's indirect tax system is overwhelming. This government believes that it needs to be improved and that Australia needs substantive tax reform. We have previously said that, if the opposition were prepared to do something in the national interest, to sit down and work with the government to improve Australia's tax system and give Australia a tax system for the 21st century, they could really contribute to the national interest. That would be something positive that the opposition could do rather than cheapjack, populist do&hyphen;nothing, know&hyphen;nothing vacuous politics.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already canvassed the lead-up to the resignation, but, as the Leader of the Opposition allows me the opportunity, let me just repeat some of the things in the correspondence that was tabled&mdash;the total denial by Mr Morris of any recollection at all of the alleged conversation between himself and Mr Sutherland, which was really the subject of the document that was given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This question also once again allows me the opportunity to contrast the behaviour and the standards of this government with the behaviour and the standards of the former government. The former government had a Prime Minister who lived in Canberra but said he was really in Sydney. It is like that old adage of the late Clive Evatt, who said, `My seat is in Hurstville, but my heart is in Athens.' It really was one of the more memorable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8755"> phrases that came out of the New South Wales Labor Party at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition is fast running out of ammunition. Here we are at seven minutes past three in question time and the Leader of the Opposition is asking me a pathetic, deflated question about some statement I made about the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I have put certain documents on the record. I have described the situation. It is perfectly clear that there is not a skerrick of evidence against me. It is perfectly clear to the Australian parliament and it is perfectly clear to the Australian people that the standards of this government and the probity of this government soar way above that of our predecessor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is not perfectly clear are the conversations that took place in the office of the Leader of the Opposition in the late weeks of September and the early days of October 1996. Did he sit down with Miss Horne and say, `Do you want 22 days or 25 days? Do you want one hire car or two hire cars? Have you spoken to Della Bosca about how much time you have to spend there? Have you had a word with Ross Free?' Ross Free was no young mistake maker. He has been around for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The man who has got the explanations to give, the person who has got the questions to answer, is the man who has allowed his staff to rort or&mdash;is it worse than that?&mdash;who has actively encouraged his staff to rort. I cannot believe it is the same man who was so indignant last week about the behaviour of some of my former ministerial colleagues, the man who allowed Simon Crean off the leash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, in that process he and the member for Hotham got into conflict. According to the member for Hotham, the Leader of the Opposition has sat down and gone through the records. Yet the Leader of the Opposition says, `No, I haven't done that.' Didn't Simon give you the material that he downloaded from the Department of Administrative Services?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting. The people who have questions to answer, the people who owe the Australian public explanations and the people 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who have to explain away their rorting behaviour are those who sit opposite&mdash;the members of the Australian Labor Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I know what great concern she has that young people in her electorate should have real opportunities to do programs in school that will help them get jobs. The Dusseldorf Skills Forum is a non-partisan organisation, which released a report last week. It compared vocational education programs in schools across the various states and territories. It is a very useful report, but it did highlight some disturbing variations across the states in the quality of the various programs that are being put in place, the involvement or lack of involvement of local industry in those programs, the quality of the student work placements and the flexibility of timetabling to allow students to undertake programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report showed that, while New South Wales had a very large number of students involved in vocational education programs compared with other states, those programs generally were, I regret to say, of low quality. They were programs which resulted in lower achievements for students. They provided limited opportunities to gain structured training in industry and to obtain workplace placements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These programs are under the control of the same government which forbade school principals from taking part in a Commonwealth program to provide job placements for school leavers. This suggests that the disre 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8756"> gard of the interests of young Australians stretches right across the Labor Party&mdash;federal and state&mdash;and that the performance of the Carr government in this regard is no different to the performance of the former Labor government in office and, indeed, of the Leader of the Opposition when he was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is already putting into vocational education programs in schools some four times as much as the previous government. That shows the enormous difference in priorities. The Leader of the Opposition sat back and did nothing while the structure of the Australian economy changed and tens of thousands of students every year were dropping out of school and falling into the unemployment queues. It is no wonder that youth unemployment under the previous government rose to 34 per cent. That is the dramatic contrast with this government, which is putting $187 million over this four-year period into expanding vocational education offerings in schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, got together and decided that they were finally going to do something for young people in this country. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition might get the Premier of New South Wales to allow principals in that state to permit their schools to participate in the jobs pathway program when it is tendered next time.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under oath and calls on him to make himself available to testify before that inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The refusal of the suspension of standing and sessional orders when it is normally moved in these sorts of circumstances is just another part of not wanting to be accountable on this particular matter as far as this government is concerned. What was tabled in this place and what we were reliably advised yesterday by no means constitutes even a smidgen of a paper trail in the various departments associated with this particular item.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we know, nevertheless, about what has happened as a result of that? We have a situation involving a cover&hyphen;up which involves at least Ministers Sharp, Jull and McGauran, and Mr Morris, Mr Sutherland, Ms McKenna, Ms Bisshop and Ms Hughes. Today, I understand, there is a possibility that another public servant has been stood down. But, Prime Minister, is it not a fact that, with the exception of Ms Bisshop and Ms Hughes, none of these people can be called by the Auditor&hyphen;General to assist his inquiry, and that therefore it makes it impossible for him to ascertain the full facts relating to the `Travelgate' cover&hyphen;up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at what those documents contain, they contain great strength in the suggestion that a deal of information was placed in the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Let us take a look at the testimony of Mr Sutherland when he was speaking about the state of knowledge in May this year of the Prime Minister's office. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I made Morris aware of the facts as I knew them, advised him of my earlier view about how the schedules should be tabled and sought his guidance. At this time my best recall is that Morris said that as the corrections were voluntary there was nothing to lead one to the conclusion that Sharp had acted improperly and the situation was different to the ex&hyphen;Labor ministers. He considered that the proposed method of tabling was right.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Front and centre, straightaway in May&mdash;the full facts and the details straight into the Prime Minister's office. The testimony associated with the sacked public servant, Bisshop, refers again to further conversations, and those conversations reveal knowledge of this matter sitting inside the Prime Minister's office. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8757">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us recollect what has been covered up here. What has been covered up here is an offence worse than those with which Cobb, Colston et al have been charged with&mdash;an offence manifestly worse than those. The Prime Minister wanted an allegation yesterday. The allegation is that he is covering up, stalling, what would have ultimately emerged by any decent standards as a police inquiry into this matter. He has stalled that. He has prevented it being brought forward. He has circled the wagons around himself on this matter. In circling the wagons around himself he has sought to protect himself. He has raised one smokescreen after another in an attempt to defend himself on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, we know about the circumstances of Mr Sharp's position about which the Prime Minister says, `Forget all about that now.' He knows darn well that Sharp cannot be called by the Auditor&hyphen;General. Always remember that: Sharp cannot be called by the Auditor&hyphen;General to discuss his motive on this. He knows darn well that Sharp's information that in January he went through his particular propositions is a lie. He knows darn well by now, although he refused to answer Mr Brereton's specific question on this, that the first of Mr Sharp's propositions which were put into his claim&mdash;which included two false claims within three days of actually putting in that claim&mdash;includes 60 per cent of the false claims that Mr Sharp put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you what happened on Monday and Tuesday and what happened over that weekend. What happened is this: even if Morris had forgotten it by the time he received that vivid telephone call, even if he had forgotten it by the time he concluded that vivid telephone call, the full details of all this&mdash;the cover&hyphen;up, the decision to draw a distinction between the Labor ministers' payback and Mr Sharp's payback; why is there that distinction?&mdash;it is one of two motives. Firstly, to put the Labor Party in a bad light or, secondly, certain knowledge that when the two were compared and a comparison made one would appear an honest mistake and the other would not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that case, not even an honest mistake&mdash;a payback unnecessarily made in relation to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor ministers in comparison with Sharp's position. That was in fact the real distinction between those two positions: the Labor ministers did not need to do it, but were revealed; Mr Sharp, at a minimum, was required to do that and Mr Sharp's position was effectively concealed. His office knew it. By that weekend he knew it himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has tried to dance around this issue and not answer it. Then he managed to stand up in this parliament and give the most extraordinary ringing endorsement of Sharp on that day. This was his position on Tuesday&mdash;I remind you of it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have immense confidence in the minister and he has my full support.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`Immense confidence' and `full support' for a person that he knows has been the subject of a cover&hyphen;up. But why did he wait until Wednesday to act on it in a totally different manner? The answer is simple. He had had a couple of soft questions from Laurie Oakes, by that journalist, into the offices of the various ministers involved&mdash;soft questions that displayed sympathy about Mr Sharp's situation. Of course, the Prime Minister felt Mr Sharp was not a rorter; he may be a little forgetful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was being put in place here was not probity, was not integrity, was not presentation of a set of facts; it was a decision to enter damage control: `Sharp too valuable to dispense with. Let us go into damage control. Let's state our very strong support for him. Let us rely on Sharp. There's a certain amount of sympathy for him and support for him in the government. Let us rely on that. Let us rely on these opinions and leave ourselves with the wagons firmly circled around Sharp.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the time the Prime Minister saw the real nature of the journalist's story on the TV news that night and the next day, he suddenly recognised that this would not be possible; this would not be plausible. So, instead of the wagons being circled around Sharp by the Prime Minister, Sharp was circled around the Prime Minister to protect the Prime Minister from this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has in place here a massive cover&hyphen;up. He has in place here a cover&hyphen;up of potentially 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8758"> fraudulent behaviour. He slings propositions at me and Evans, though he knows darn well that Evans's department cleared off on the action taken at that point of time, but he will decide to raise all that. Mr Evans's then department, under the now tender mercies of Daryl Williams, have not yet had an opportunity to express a view on this, and they will not get it. If they decide to take it, at any point they decide to take it, they will not have had the opportunity of an Auditor-General or any investigative process at that point of time going to Sharp's motives or the motives of the other ministers who are concerned here. It was a point of sheer maliciousness approved by the Prime Minister's office and approved by the Prime Minister himself. `Take those Labor members who did not need to declare their proposition and pay it back, but do not reveal what Sharp has done.' You can understand to some extent why you would not want to reveal what Sharp has done. It puts him right in it, unlike the other persons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the problem is that what is involved there, Prime Minister, is a cover&hyphen;up. The only way you will get to the bottom of that is through a judicial inquiry. You have a shattered government. Probity, from a man who has lost seven ministers in 18 months! He says that a new standard has been established in Australian politics. You can bet your bottom dollar a new standard has been established: it is right down there. This failure to take on board immediately after question time, after no censure motion had been moved until this point of time on these matters&mdash;despite the fact that three ministers have gone&mdash;just goes to show that the cover-up is still in, the fix is still in, as far as this Prime Minister is concerned. We will not be blackmailed by paltriness into backing off on this. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Travelgate cover&hyphen;up has engulfed this government: three sacked ministers, three public servants gone and, as we understand it, another one still to go. What we have is the unctuous Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this House today reminding us of when he said to the Australian people, `I am going to be a different Prime Minister; I am going to be a better Prime Minister; I am going to raise the standards.' This is a person who has hidden every aspect that we have tried to drag out, and it has been revealed in this House only when we forced him to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through yesterday's documentation we have shown that we have evidence that at the core of this cover&hyphen;up is a politically framed document&mdash;a document which differentiates Labor Party members from those of the government, a document which misled this parliament and led to the person who tabled it having to be sacked. We have a government which, in the process, directed the public servants to prepare that document. That is what we have got from a Prime Minister who says he was going to lift the standards&mdash;misleading and directing the Public Service to prepare a document that presents the misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who was in on the act? We know that the Prime Minister says that he does not know anything. He said it six times on Friday. And it is not the first time he has used that excuse&mdash;not the first time at all. In case anyone missed it, the Prime Minister of Australia's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8759"> defence for this tawdry cover&hyphen;up is, `I don't know anything.' We have a Prime Minister of the nation that repeats six times over, `I know nothing.' The Prime Minister of the nation is somewhere between Sergeant Schultz in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hogan's Heroes</EMPHASIS> and Manuel from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fawlty Towers</EMPHASIS>&mdash;`I know nothing, I know nothing.' This is the pathetic defence of the Prime Minister of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who were the players that have been revealed in the documents tabled by him yesterday? We have got the ministers, Sharp and Jull. We have now got embroiled Minister Scott, and I hope that he is looking through his records and I hope the National Party leader, who expressed confidence in him today, is asking him the same probing questions as those that we are prepared to ask. We have got Sutherland, we have got Morris, we have got McKenna, we have got Semmens in DAS, we have got Carolyn Hughes in DAS and we have got Philomena Bisshop in PM&amp;C. They are the players we know so far. They are the players identified in the documentation tabled yesterday. Eight out of nine of those players have already been sacrificed. The bodies are falling around the Prime Minister like nine pins. Remember the old Queen classic <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Another one bites the dust</EMPHASIS>? There they were, rolling over, being hacked to pieces, because the Prime Minister said he knew nothing, but at the end of the day he was still standing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple facts are these: the Auditor-General's review is flawed. It is flawed because it has no power to call the majority of those key players. That is the fact of it. We have got these people identified on the record because of documents that the Prime Minister has tabled, yet he is going to have an inquiry that will not even have the power to bring them forward. That is why we are saying that what we need is a full judicial inquiry, an inquiry with the ability to compel people to come in under oath and to fess up. The Prime Minister's inquiry wants to hide them. He wants to hide them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the Prime Minister's knowledge, he says that he did not know in May. But we know that he knew on Sunday, coming backing from the Cook Islands. We know that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Morris related to him the vivid recollection of the conversation with Sutherland. We know that the Prime Minister was fully briefed. We have a Prime Minister who every time he is in trouble sets up an inquiry without power. He sees bodies fall around him like ninepins and his defence is, `I know nothing.' He pleads ignorance. The Prime Minister who said he is lifting standards has debased them and he should be censured. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only real interest left in this thing is the contest between Beazley and Crean. You could see the energy. You could see the member for Hotham thinking, `If I put a bit more vigour into it maybe somebody up there&mdash;maybe George Megalogenis or Michelle&mdash;will say, `Gee, Crean put in a good performance and Beazley looked a bit lacklustre today.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a real fizzer of an attempt to censure. It is an absolute fizzer because there is no substance in your allegations. Look at those who sit opposite and the sort of clockwork, but fundamentally unenthusiastic, response of those who sit behind. Your moment to try and generate a bit of momentum was yesterday, but instead of getting stuck into it from the very beginning yesterday you wasted 50 minutes on the Australian Law Reform Commission. Really, I must have a mole at their tactics meeting&mdash;I really must; I wonder who he is&mdash;because they wasted 50 minutes on the Australian Law Reform Commission and then they squandered two questions on the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the real reason why the Leader of the Opposition has moved this attempted censure motion today is that he is under heat over his car rorting. That is the reason why.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The `take' out of question time today is that Beazley has got to explain why it is that he rorted the Comcar allowance; why he sent a staff member on leave, still being on the payroll of the Commonwealth, when that person was not working for Mr Beazley, not working for the Commonwealth government, but working for John Della Bosca, the general secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party. We all know those rules. He thought rather cleverly that he had caught me 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8760"> on that. He tried to besmirch the name of my good friend Vincent Willcock and instead of being right he was wrong again. Your information on that was absolutely wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But today's rather pathetic censure motion, Kim, is a day and a half late and it is on an occasion when the real news is your having to explain to the Australian public why it is that you allowed a member of your staff to act in a particular way. You asked me a few questions; we might well ask you, did you authorise Miss Horne to claim the use of that car in breach of her entitlements? Was it your idea or was it her idea? Is the real explanation that Ross Free and John Della Bosca rang you up and said, `Look, mate, the New South Wales branch is stony broke.' Remember, the New South Wales branch was keen to run in this. You were not terribly keen as I understand it. You perhaps feared what the result might be. But Della Bosca said to you, `Look, Kim, you are the leader; it is your opportunity to make a dent in the Liberal members' majority, so will you please make a staff member available?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With reckless indifference to the rules, without asking yourself whether you were breaking the rules, without asking yourself whether you had any entitlements, what did you do? Did you actually directly authorise her? Did you give it to Epstein to authorise her or what? Perhaps you might like to table a few documents. Perhaps you might like to explain to the Australian parliament how it is that this came about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let it be understood by the parliament from the very beginning that the reason we are having this censure motion today is that the Leader of the Opposition is in trouble over rorted Comcar claims. That is the reason. It has absolutely nothing to do with any argument of substance. It is well known in this place that the censure is meant to be the culmination of a concerted parliamentary onslaught. It is meant to be the high point of the opposition's attack on the government. It is meant to be the moment at which the person against whom the censure is directed is left staggering under the rhetorical blows of his all&hyphen;powerful opponent. But what do we have today? It is the old story: if you live in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> glass houses, you do not throw stones. And if you have rorted your Comcar allowance, you do not make allegations against decent people. That is what has happened to this bloke and that is why he has decided to drag out this censure motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us, once again, take the opportunity that the censure motion affords us to very calmly go through the facts. In order to establish a case in this parliament for the establishment of an inquiry, it is first necessary to have not a huge detailed body of evidence, but at the very beginning you have got to have some evidence. You cannot just have mere rhetorical assertions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know what my opposite number had the hide to say at the weekend? He said, `This is like Neville Wran, when he stood aside.' Do you know what happened to Neville Wran? The allegation made against Neville Wran was that he actually rang up Murray Farquhar to fix the hearing in relation to Kevin Humphreys, the former chief executive of the New South Wales Rugby League. In other words, in relation to Neville Wran, there was a direct allegation by a third party of wrongdoing. In relation to me, no such thing has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The allegation has been made by Mr Sutherland that he spoke to both Ms McKenna and Mr Morris. Of the two people whom he claims to have spoken to one of them has categorically denied any recollection and the other has explained a contact, in the document that has been tabled, in circumstances that are entirely understandable and entirely consistent with the way in which she handled the particular matter. That is the beginning and the end of this unbelievably serious charge against me. This is the withering onslaught that I am meant to crumple under. This is the killer punch that is meant to bring the Prime Minister down. This is the culmination of a well orchestrated, carefully planned, meticulously mapped out parliamentary onslaught on the leader of the government, and it works out as a complete and utter fizzer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know whose idea this was? I think this was Simon's idea. I do not want to be uncharitable or unfair, but do you know what 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8761"> I think happened? Simon was not allowed to ask a question yesterday. Remember? He was gagged yesterday. We all thought we would have this onslaught from the member for Hotham. He probably went back to his office and said, `How do I get back at him? How do I pay him back for having shut me out of the action? I have lost a whole night on television because he would not allow me to ask a question.' He goes back to his office and he says, `I know what I'll do. I'll advise him to move a censure.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So having lost his opportunity yesterday, having really wrecked it yesterday, what does the Leader of the Opposition do? The Leader of the Opposition decides to move a censure motion knowing full well that the real story out of today is the absolute failure of the Leader of the Opposition to explain away his own rorting of his Comcar allowance. Let me say again to the Leader of the Opposition: there is no substance in this allegation. The Australian public knows that. I am telling the truth. You are flailing around without any substance to your allegations. You are in trouble and you owe the Australian public an explanation as to why you systematically rorted your Comcar allowance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am today announcing the government's response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: Towards fair trading in Australia.</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three years ago the then Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating told Australia's small business people that `This is as good as it gets'. Well, I am delighted to report to the House, and to Mr Keating if he is listening in, that under a Howard coalition government it is now getting a whole lot better. Make no mistake about it, this federal coalition government, this Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and this minister, is pro&hyphen;small business, and proud of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This response is a further down payment on the coalition's `New deal for small business', the small business policy on which we were elected in March last year. Already that policy is being delivered, including the fundamental program of reform to small business regulation announced by the Prime Minister in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS> statement in March of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This response on fair trading policy, entitled `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New deal: Fair deal&mdash;Giving small business a fair go</EMPHASIS>, is the strongest message ever sent from Canberra to Australia's small business community that they now have a national government that has listened, has understood and has acted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that after 13 years of federal Labor governments small business has done it tough. Labor gave small business an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> economic recession, record interest rates, a punishing tax system, a huge burden of bureaucracy and red tape and a job&hyphen;destroying unfair dismissal law. And in relation to fair trading, Labor governments squibbed the issue. Small business did it tough under Labor governments. Now a coalition government is making the tough decisions for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July I assumed portfolio responsibility for small business when the Prime Minister elevated small business policy into the Australian cabinet. I have spent the bulk of this time listening to small business across Australia on the issue of fair trading and on other issues of concern. I have been reminded by small business how frustrated they have been by the failure of previous governments to take action to address fair trading issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's approach was to raise small business hopes by promising reviews, reports and recommendations only to have those hopes dashed by inaction, by reports shelved, recommendations ignored and issues deferred to the too&hyphen;hard basket. In all, 17 fair trading reports, reviews or draft proposals in 13 years of Labor. Nothing achieved. That was life for small business under Labor, where the Hawke&hyphen;Keating cabinets rolled small business every time because they never really understood the non&hyphen;unionised small business community in Australia. It is laughable that Labor would now have you believe they suddenly care about this and wanted to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to announce that the cycle of reports shelved, hopes dashed and Labor cabinet inaction has been broken. Today I announce to this House that after consideration of our one and only report on fair trading we have decided, unambiguously, that small business is right when it calls for action to address fair trading issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a coalition government, small business gets action, not just words or promises. So much so that I will be immediately introducing into this House today legislation to amend the Trade Practices Act that gives small business protection in its commercial dealings with big business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package of reforms arises directly from the decision of the Howard coalition govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8766"> ment to act as it promised in establishing the parliamentary committee on fair trading three months after coming to government. That committee, chaired by my highly respected colleague the member for Bendigo, Mr Bruce Reid MP, and its subsequent report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS>, outlined the litany of business conduct issues that had emerged during the past decade and which had not been addressed by Australian governments and policy makers in the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was given broad terms of reference to examine these business conduct issues, and to develop options and strategies which would provide solutions. Although not limited in its analysis, the committee was asked to have particular reference to the position of small retail tenants and franchisees&mdash;areas of industry where repeated calls for action against unfair conduct had been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Reid committee received more than 200 submissions from business groups and individuals, and over 50 organisations gave evidence in public hearings. The report was tabled on 26 May 1997&mdash;18 weeks ago. The committee found that small businesses were often disadvantaged in their dealings with big business. According to the committee, much of this unfair business conduct has arisen from the imbalance between parties prior to making an agreement. Without a doubt many small business operators have suffered as a result. The risks associated with operating a business have increased with the economic and social costs being borne by the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In presenting the report, the committee advised the House that the concerns about unfair business conduct towards small business are justified, and should be addressed urgently. The committee recommended a number of specific measures, including legislation, to induce behavioural change on the part of big business towards smaller business, and to provide unfairly treated small business with adequate means of redress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has accepted these conclusions. This is the time to act&mdash;to rectify the policy failures of past Labor governments and Labor cabinets and to induce the behavioural 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> change which the committee so rightly identified. That is why I am moving immediately to introduce legislation into this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will act on the recommendations of each of the seven areas of reform identified by the committee&mdash;unfair conduct, retail tenancy, franchising, misuse of market power, small business finance, access to justice and education. The government has accepted the committee's recommendations either in whole or in part, according to the constraints on Commonwealth powers and the importance of delivering a policy outcome that maximises the benefits to small business whilst minimising any counterproductive impacts on the sector. In a number of important respects the government response has gone further than the committee has recommended, particularly in the area of effective enforcement of fair trading issues for small business by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, ACCC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government response is a package of reforms. The reforms are based around stronger legislation protecting small business through the Trade Practices Act 1974 and state and territory retail tenancy laws, as well as legally recognised codes of conduct, more powerful enforcement of legal rights and better targeted information and alternative dispute resolution. Our response will ensure that small business can confidently deal with large firms in the knowledge that the rules under which they are operating are fair, and that there will be proper redress available when those rules are broken. Our response will give small business the confidence to grow jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental objective of the government is, in the words of the committee, to `induce behavioural change' where improved standards of commercial conduct are required, and not a mere desire to create a more litigious commercial environment. By adopting these measures the government has ensured that the desired outcomes are achieved without unduly impacting on the operation of the open market or compromising the basic principles of contractual relations and commercial risk which remain at the core of our free enterprise economy. I now outline the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8767"> major strategies which have been determined by the government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Unfair conduct and trade practices reform</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pivotal to the government's response is an acceptance that the Trade Practices Act must be made to work for small business. This requires an approach which improves the substantive legal rights available to small business against unfair business conduct, as well as administrative measures which facilitate improved enforcement of rights and access to remedies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will achieve these objectives in five ways:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a new provision in the Trade Practices Act that will give small business genuine access to protection against unconscionable conduct;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a new provision which will allow industry&hyphen;designed codes of practice, in whole or part, to be legally underpinned and be made mandatory under the Trade Practices Act and enforced as breaches of the act;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a new provision which will allow the ACCC to take representative actions on behalf of small business for misuse of market power by big business;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a new provision which will give small business interests equal importance to consumer interests when appointments are made to the ACCC; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the issuing of a direction to the ACCC under the Trade Practices Act requiring the ACCC to enforce small business legal rights against unfair business conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, the legislative strengthening of the Trade Practices Act in this manner will provide for open and fair competition which underpins the legislative scheme of the act. It is wholly consistent with the philosophy of the government parties which first introduced trade practices legislation into Australia some 30 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In announcing this measure, the government has accepted the principle that small business people are entitled to a legal protection against unfair business conduct comparable with that which consumers already have against corporations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, the government will mirror in a new section of the Trade Practices Act the legal rights available to consumers in section 51AB and incorporate a range of additional matters set out in recommendation 6.1 of the committee's report in order to tailor the provision appropriately to its statutory purpose of protecting small businesses. Conduct against business consumers which is unconscionable having regard to the enumerated factors will be prohibited by the act and give rise to a broad range of remedies under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new provision will extend the existing common law doctrine of unconscionability expressed in the existing section 51AA of the current act. The bill will use the expression `unconscionable conduct' rather than `unfair conduct' in order to build on the existing body of case law which has worked with respect to consumer protection provisions of the act and which will provide greater certainty to small businesses in assessing their legal rights and remedies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As this is a new provision targeted to small business, the new provision will be limited to transactions which do not exceed $1 million. Publicly listed companies will not be able to instigate action under this new provision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Legal recognition of Codes of Conduct</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises that industry codes of practice can offer flexible and efficient mechanisms to address issues of business practice. However, experience has shown that for some codes of practice legislative underpinning is necessary to ensure the effective operation of the code and to achieve the desired behavioural change in industry sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has accepted the principle of the Reid committee's recommendation 6.2. The bill I will be introducing will include in the Trade Practices Act a new part which will enable the whole or parts of codes of practice to be underpinned as either mandatory or voluntary codes, after an appropriate approval process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will provide small business with dual advantages&mdash;the benefit of participating in the design of industry regulation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8768"> addressing unfair conduct, and the security of knowing that mandated codes or provisions of codes can be directly enforced under the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Franchising </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Reid committee devoted much analysis to unfair conduct issues experienced in the franchising sector. The committee concluded that specific legislative measures were required to be taken to redress the imbalance in commercial relations between franchisors and franchisees. It is clear that the previous government's approach to voluntary franchising regulation has not worked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has decided that a strengthened franchising code of practice must be re&hyphen;established as a matter of urgency. The government has also decided that this code must be a mandatory code with key elements such as pre&hyphen;contractual disclosure underpinned by the Trade Practices Act. These measures are essential to provide the franchising sector with the required certainty of operation and an equitable scheme of regulation across franchise systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will establish a nine&hyphen;member Franchising Policy Council, consisting of an independent chair, three members representing franchisors, three representing franchisees and two representing service providers. The Council's first task will be to advise and report to the government on the recommended terms of the mandatory code, including the definition of `franchise system' for the purposes of the code and whether any sector of the franchising industry should or should not be exempt from the recommended provisions of the mandatory code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will distribute an exposure draft of a new code in order to accelerate the work of the Franchising Policy Council. The council will continue to advise the government on policy issues associated with the code, many of which were raised by the committee, including the rights of franchisees in tenancy arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The franchising code will be monitored and enforced by a Codes of Conduct Enforcement Unit to be established within the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government has a strong preference for including alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in the franchising code in order to minimise litigation and legal costs in the sector. In addition to the recommendations of the committee, the government will appoint a Dispute Resolution Adviser to assist parties to avoid disputes and to quickly resolve disputes that arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will ensure that small business franchisees and franchisors are well informed about the franchising code through the development of information modules, training packages and widespread promotion of the code and its benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also decided that specific attention must be given to strengthening the position of small business franchisees in the oil industry in relation to unfair conduct issues. The government has decided that these issues are best addressed by accepting the objectives of recommendation 3.3 of the Reid committee and establishing a stronger OilCode as a mandatory code of practice. This mandatory code will also be underpinned by the Trade Practices Act. Further details relating to OilCode will be separately released by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the Hon. John Moore MP.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Retail tenancy</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has accepted the broad conclusion of the committee that retail tenants are entitled to stronger legislative protection against unfair conduct than currently applies. That stronger protection must include improved legislation based on two principles&mdash;that the legislation should apply equitably across the retail sector, and that the legislation should not result in a more complex regime of cross&hyphen;jurisdictional tenancy regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be recognised that the Federal government has only limited constitutional capacity to legislate with respect to retail tenancies. Any legislation would leave some small businesses outside the scope of such protections because they and their landlords may not be incorporated. Small businesses seeking to enforce remedies would be trapped into litigation focused on technical matters such as the cross&hyphen;jurisdictional reach of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8769"> Federal or state/territory laws, and not the issues of substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These outcomes would be highly discriminatory within the retail sector and counterproductive to small retail tenants. Only state and territory legislation, which does not suffer these constraints, can provide the universal and non&hyphen;discriminatory protections required by small and specialist retailers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding these limitations on Commonwealth power, the government has seized the political opportunity made possible by the Reid report to facilitate national negotiations between peak representatives of retail tenants, the Australian Retailers Association, and retail landlords, the Property Council of Australia, on best practice principles for tenancy reform. Through the government's leadership and the cooperative approach of the parties, I am pleased to advise that progress has been made by the industry on agreements to improve the legislative safety net for small business retailers under state and territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government particularly believes that effective low cost justice is an essential element of any retail tenancy safety net and should be incorporated in all state and territory legislation where it does not currently exist. Accordingly, the government will adopt a dual strategy to address tenancy issues raised in the committee's report. Firstly, the government will release to state and territory governments, and publicly, national benchmark principles for tenancy reform, and take a leadership role in advocating an enhanced safety net of legal protections for retail tenants under state and territory legislation. A special meeting of state and territory ministers responsible for retail tenancy will be convened before the end of this year. That special ministerial meeting will be charged with the task of responding to the nationally determined benchmark principles, as well as addressing the non&hyphen;agreed matters which relate to security of tenure, disclosure of turnover, and recovery of outgoings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the government's small business amendment to the Trade Practices Act proposed by this bill will provide a new avenue for some small and specialist retailers to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pursue remedies against unconscionable conduct in the retail tenancy relationship. This would provide legal recourse under the Trade Practices Act where retail leasing contracts or conduct by retail landlords within the scope of the law was unconscionable. This new provision will be particularly beneficial to retail tenants as it allows a court to have regard to the relative strengths of the bargaining position of the retailer and the landlord in determining whether the conduct complained of was unconscionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the government has accepted the recommendation of the committee concerning the economic and social impact of the proliferation of shopping centres and, recognising that this is primarily an issue for state and territory planning laws, will refer this matter for consideration by state and territory governments, as contemplated by the Reid committee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Misuse of market power</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In focusing its attention on the issue of the misuse of market power, the committee recommended that the Trade Practices Act be amended to enable the ACCC to take representative actions on behalf of small businesses under part IV of the act. The government has accepted this recommendation, as well as the related recommendation that these matters be the subject of investigation by the appropriate enforcement authority in the retail sector as a priority matter. Legislation to amend the act in accordance with this decision will be introduced following the necessary consultations with state and territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Small business finance</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government acted decisively earlier this month to announce fundamental reforms to the structure of the Australian financial system following the report of the Wallis inquiry. Small business is a significant client of the Australian financial industry. These reforms will promote greater competition and efficiency within the financial sector, and will benefit small business in dealing with large lending institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to making structural changes to the Australian financial system, the government has considered each of the specific 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8770"> recommendations made by the committee on small business finance issues. The government has accepted, in principle, the Reid committee's recommendation that the Australian banking industry ombudsman scheme and the banking code of practice should be extended from unincorporated small business to include small business which is incorporated. The government will advise the financial industry of this decision, and invite immediate consultation on an appropriate definition of small business for these purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also accepts the recommendation of the Reid committee to examine the feasibility of establishing a specialised dispute resolution mechanism for complaints against receivers and liquidators in consultation with industry bodies and other interested parties. The recommendations of the committee relating to client confidentiality will be accepted by submitting these matters to the review by Treasury and the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department on the potential economic implications of positive credit reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also agreed that Treasury continue to monitor the small business lending market to ensure that the benefits of enhanced competition are passed on to the small business sector. In this context, banks will be expected to review and develop better methods of risk assessment and re&hyphen;examine interest rate premiums charged on small business loans. Small business will also have access to the new provision of the Trade Practices Act relating to unconscionable conduct in seeking redress against unfair dealing by financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Access to justice and enforcement of small business remedies</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Reid committee recommended in its report that the ACCC be pro&hyphen;active in promoting compliance with legal remedies for small business and in establishing a body of precedents which could be used to influence inappropriate business conduct. The government accepts the need to ensure that the improved legal rights for small business and in this response are supplemented with credible and effective enforcement mechanisms.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although limitations exist on the Commonwealth's power to compel alternative dispute resolution, the government will promote, particularly in codes of practice, low cost alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, especially in relation to franchising disputes, tenancy disputes and disputes between small business and financial institutions. These mechanisms include mediation, arbitration, conciliation and in appropriate cases early neutral evaluation or expert appraisal. The government will also accept the Reid committee's recommendation to have the Attorney&hyphen;General examine impediments to the ability of small business to access the traditional legal system, in consultation with state and territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has decided to go further than the Reid committee's recommendations on the issue of enforcement. Once the amendments to the Trade Practices Act are in operation, the government will issue a direction under section 29 of that act requiring the ACCC to initiate test cases under the new unconscionability provision at the earliest possible opportunity. This will send a strong message to the business community that the government is serious about improving the standard of business conduct affecting small business. Additional funding of $480,000 each year for the next four years has been committed to fund precedent setting test cases to be taken by the ACCC on behalf of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will also amend section 7 of the Trade Practices Act to require at least one full&hyphen;time commissioner of the ACCC to be a person experienced in small business matters, thereby putting small business on an equal footing with the statutory requirement for representation of consumer interests. This amendment will also be introduced following the necessary consultations with state and territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the interim, the government will appoint two new associate commissioners of the ACCC dedicated to small business issues. In addition, a small business case officer will be appointed by the ACCC in each state to provide a focus on the enforcement and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8771"> promotion of small business issues in the jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A Codes of Conduct Enforcement Unit to be set up in the ACCC will also provide a focus of activity in relation to the enforcement of mandatory and voluntary codes underpinned by the Trade Practices act. A Codes Policy Unit will also be set up in the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A discussion paper proposing a legislative outline to improve the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act in protecting small business and consumers will also be released forthwith by the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, Senator the Hon. Chris Ellison. This paper responds to Australian Law Reform Commission Report No. 68 on compliance with the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Information, education and training</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government places high importance on improving the quality of information, education and training available to small business about business conduct and fair trading issues. Notwithstanding the government's commitment to strengthened enforcement mechanisms, the adage of prevention being better than cure remains true&mdash;especially for small businesses with limited financial resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government accepts the committee's recommendations on this important matter. The government will develop an information and awareness campaign targeting start&hyphen;up and existing businesses. This will include material specific to industry sectors such as shopping centre tenancies and franchises. The government will coordinate these information and training programs at a national level but will do so in conjunction with state and territory governments and private sector industry associations in order to minimise duplication and maximise penetration into the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package of measures responds in a direct and positive manner to the committee's report and recommendations. This is a multidimensional reform which, once implemented, will constitute a landmark change for the small business community. It will improve business conduct in the Australian economy and provide a more efficient and equitable 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> basis upon which the forces of competition can operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a package which the government will support with all necessary resources. The financial resources committed by the government will be in excess of $2.5 million each year, with a total funding commitment of $11.3 million over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I conclude I wish to publicly thank a number of people: firstly, I and my parliamentary secretary, the member for Mitchell, the Hon. Alan Cadman MP, thank all members of the fair trading committee, and especially Bruce Reid; secondly, the many individuals and organisations who met with me, my parliamentary secretary and my staff in recent weeks and gave the government the benefit of their views; thirdly, Geoff Prosser, who worked very hard in his time as small business minister and who should be recognised for his untiring efforts for small business; and, lastly, the Office of Small Business, and John Grant and his team, and my senior adviser, Peter Anderson, who has put in a tremendous effort to put this package together, and other ministerial advisers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under a Labor government small business waited for 13 years for such a package. It was never delivered. Labor squibbed on the hard decisions. In contrast, under the Howard coalition government the cycle of inaction has been broken. As promised, small business in Australia is now getting a new deal, a fair deal, a fair go. To the Leader of the Opposition, who believed three years ago that `this is as good as it gets', I say, `For small business things have just got a whole lot better.' I commend this response to the House and present the following paper:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, Report, `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: Towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> ': Government Response&mdash;&mdash;Ministerial statement, 30 September 1997.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I was going to say one or two nice things about the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) before he gets away, because I know he has a pressing round of engagements with the media that he wants to get to so that he can put his views 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8772"> forward further on the statement that he has just tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that he has been able to achieve through his cabinet far more than we anticipated and far more than his backbench and members of the committee anticipated. He therefore deserves congratulations. I am quite happy to stand in this parliament and say congratulations to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business on getting as much of that is through as he was able to do. I am not sure whether, if his friend and colleague the Treasurer (Mr Costello) had been in the country, it would have been such an easy battle, but he has succeeded. Based on past records of Treasurers in governments that went before his, I suspect that his task was made a little easier because of the absence of P1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the opposition, I say that this response is welcome. It is welcome, even if it is overdue. Those on the other side may laugh, but this was a government that went out amongst the small business community and said, `We established a committee of inquiry. When its report is tabled, we will respond within three months because we know it is so important.' Subsequently, there was the demise of the then minister for small business, who was minister for landlords, and the installation of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business in that job, so an extension of time was granted. Then the government said, `We will come back by the end of September and bring down a response.' They made it with a day to spare. I suppose, therefore, the small business constituency and we in this place should be grateful that that happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I go to some of the specific issues that are contained in this statement, I say to the House that I think that on a number of occasions the minister and other people in this place have actually maligned the position that former ministers and indeed the former Labor government took in respect of small business. It is a fact that a former Minister for Small Business, the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), brought forward a report and proposed legislation to look at the issue of unconscionable conduct. It is a fact&mdash;and he 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> admitted it in this place when the report was tabled&mdash;that he was unsuccessful in getting that through the cabinet, for reasons that I explained a little earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to recognise that it was a Labor government that in 1995 brought into this parliament a bill to do exactly what, on the outline that has been presented to us today, the present government seeks to do on unconscionable conduct. In fact, that bill was introduced in 1995 by Senator Schacht, the then Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction. Regrettably, for a number of reasons that occurred in March the following year, parliament was not reassembled after the Christmas break. As a consequence, with the change of government, that legislation lapsed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is also fair to say that that exact same legislation, picking up unfair and unconscionable conduct, was laid before this parliament as a private member's bill by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in May of last year and again earlier this year, when it lapsed and went off the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. That was done because we believed after our time in government&mdash;as some have rightly pointed out, it probably took us longer than we would have liked at the time to get that legislation here&mdash;that it needed to be picked up. It is interesting that that same bill, if I am not mistaken&mdash;we have to wait until this afternoon when the minister actually introduces the legislation into the House&mdash;will mirror exactly what Kim Beazley put into the place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the bill has been there since May of last year. If this government were serious about protecting small businesses from unfair and unconscionable conduct, they could have simply picked up the Leader of the Opposition's private member's bill and introduced it here. I have said time and time again that we had done the work for you, as usual. We had led by example. We had provided the bill. All the government had to do was pick it up and run with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is also important to state that a number of comments have been made about what Labor did for small business. Yet, interestingly, when you go to any of the reports and comments made by the Prime 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8773"> Minister (Mr Howard) in this place on different occasions, where they talk about small business, they say&mdash;in fact, I am referring to the statement that the Prime Minister made in this place on 24 March this year called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS>, which was the response to Charlie Bell's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for business</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that, in the decade to 1994-95, small business accounted for 1.1 million of the 1.2 million net jobs created over that period. If I hark back, I seem to remember that Labor was in government in that decade that we are talking about which created those businesses and created those jobs. Yet, the coalition, including the Prime Minister, come in here and say that the Labor Party did not do one thing for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important also to just hark back on the inquiry's establishment and what was the catalyst for it. I think the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology that worked on and tabled the report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS> did an absolutely marvellous job. I echo the sentiments expressed in this place about the contribution by the chairman, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). I equally say to the deputy chairman, the member for Rankin, and to other members of this place&mdash;including my good friend the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), who is a member of that committee&mdash;that the report itself that was brought down in this place is one of the better reports of a parliamentary committee. That can be judged by the way in which it became the focus of so much anger and so much desire on the part of small businesses to see something happen that the government simply had to respond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day it was because of the mobilisation of small businesses right around this country of ours at retail rallies. These were led by people like Lisa Michael from the United Retailers Association in Victoria, Nick Catania from the Western Australian Retailers Association and a whole variety of other individuals, such as Gai Burton from the Independent Small Business Association in Queensland, who specifically saw the need for this report to be adopted and to be put in its 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> entirety into this parliament and adopted by government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it was retail rallies attracting 1,000 individuals at a time, and smaller ones than that around Australia, that put the views directly to people like the parliamentary secretary for small business when he was in Newcastle&mdash;he could not wait to get out of the place by the time it was over&mdash;put them directly to people like the member for Bendigo in Melbourne, put them directly to people like the Leader of the Opposition and me from our side of parliament in Perth and in Melbourne and, in my case, quite a number of other places. It is for those very reasons that the expectations have been raised as to what was actually going to be delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another element of this too. When this report was instituted and when responses were being sought to it, we had at the time a minister in the coalition government&mdash;the now defunct minister for small business, the minister for landlords, who now sits on the back bench&mdash;actually going out and playing a spoiling role. Without dwelling too much on the history of that, I think we had in the frame of the then minister for small business, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), a role being played where he was out there espousing the principles of the landlords all the time, rather than saying he would wait to get the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS> so that he would be able to take an even-handed approach when it came to government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague the member for Brisbane says, I think we did do small business a favour by getting rid of him. I think his demise meant that yes, a cabinet minister was given responsibility for small business who was able&mdash;because he has tried to gather numbers on the back bench&mdash;to make sure that he was able to get a positive response through caucus and through cabinet. As I said, the fact that one or two other cabinet ministers might not have been there on the day that it went through and that the Prime Minister always professes to be Saint John of small business&mdash;he does believe that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8774"> he stands for small business&mdash;probably accounted for it happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important we also ask: what do small businesses want? It is interesting, too, when you think of what we mean in our definition of small business, because it means many things to many people. Small business is not a generic term. Fifty per cent of small businesses in this country are micro&hyphen;businesses. They are businesses with one or two people and no employees. They might be husband and wife, or brother and sister, or whatever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence, it is difficult then to go on and talk about the sorts of things which my good friend the minister does&mdash;unfair dismissal laws in small business and so on. They are not the major issues that they are worried about. They are worried about people coming in the front door. They are worried about business confidence. They are worried about the confidence in the economy. They are worried about interest rate reductions being passed on to them as small business people in the same way as they are if you are a new home buyer. They are worried about whether or not their franchise is going to continue to operate in a reasonable environment and relationship with a franchisor. If they happen to be retail tenants in shopping centres, they are concerned about whether, when they come in the next day, the shop will be boarded up or locked up by landlords who are trying to get excessive rents out of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you see the minister say in his speech, `The government has accepted the committee's recommendations either in whole or in part, according to the constraints on Commonwealth powers and the importance of delivering a policy outcome that maximises the benefits to small business whilst minimising any counterproductive impacts on the sector,' you have to have a very close looksee at what that actually means. There are plenty of in&hyphen;principle acceptances of the recommendations in the committee report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS>, but at the end of the day the result that has come forward in this package is slightly fudged at the edges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said in this place, at rallies and in a whole variety of environments that, if the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government adopted in toto <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS>, this committee report, the Labor Party would support the legislation emanating from it in both this House and the Senate posthaste. Get it in place and give some relief to small business. The government has committed itself to some changes and the government has committed itself to bringing down some legislation. That legislation is to be introduced this afternoon. We will reserve our view on that legislation until we see it. But if it goes in the direction in which the minister outlined in his speech here this afternoon, then again I reaffirm Labor's endorsement of it and its swift passage through this place, because that is what is necessary for consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, I agree that the parliamentary committee did a great job. Whilst we welcome the reforms that have been introduced in a variety of areas, particularly the legislative protection against unfair or unconscionable conduct, I have to say that this response by the government does miss the mark in one very important area&mdash;retail tenancy. It misses it because it has just introduced some bandaid measures in respect of retail tenancy matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am afraid that this government response does reflect something of a lack of courage on behalf of the government in going the whole hog for small business. I am afraid I still see the hand of big business or the hand of the former minister for landlords on the shoulder of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business at the present time because where it has been squibbed is in respect of small retail tenants who are in shopping centres. That is where it has been squibbed here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of all the recommendations contained in this response, the recommendation in section 2 on retail tenancy, which says that there should be a uniform retail tenancy code underpinned by changes to the Trade Practices Act, is missing. Instead, in its place we have, as has been clearly outlined by the minister, a discussion that is to take place with state governments on the pretext that the states are the responsible entities when it comes to retail tenancy matters and the Commonwealth has not got a legitimate role.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8775">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That simply is not the case. I refer the minister to the committee's report and also to the report of the Motor Traders Association of Australia called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Addressing the balance</EMPHASIS>, which I am sure he has got. That report is a response to some of the myths that are around about the Reid committee's report and its recommendations. Attached to that report is legal advice provided by Blake Dawson and Waldron to the effect that the corporations power gives this government the opportunity to deal with retail tenancy laws at the state and territory levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government, by not putting a uniform retail tenancy code in place and instead going off, as the minister has said, and talking to the states and all the rest of it, has not done what retail tenants want. It has not given them the protection that they want in respect of the sorts of things covered in here. What are those sorts of issues? Again, I simply refer members to the report itself&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the uniform retail tenancy code that was being sought, small businesses wanted to have covered issues such as security of tenure, lease assignment, disclosure of rents paid, rents and rent review, outgoings and promotions, leases and disclosure statements, tenancy mix, redevelopment and relocation. Under what we see now, none of that is there. Under what we have seen here, it simply is not going to happen. What we are going to get, as I have said, is just a series of talkfests put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other element in respect of retail tenancy matters was the recommendation that retail lease tribunals as part of a low&hyphen;cost mediation and conciliation process be put in place. Again, that is not adopted. That recommendation is critical to allow the mum and dad small businesses low&hyphen;cost redress if they have a problem in a regional shopping centre with the management or the company that operates that centre. That is not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, we see the minister talking about going back to the courts. Go and talk to these small business people. Talk about inverse market power! If the mum and dad running a small business in a regional shopping centre were to take on the might of one of the large 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> outfits in this country, who would win? Who would throw money at it? The big companies do not want to see any of these sorts of cases going against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to saying that they will put money into some of these cases proceeding so that there is a body of case law, I understand that that has been tried. I understand that that was a suggestion that was made in the past. It all gets settled out of court because no-one has the money to go on with it and the big companies do not want to take it any further so that that case law exists. How do you expect this thing to work if those sorts of problems are still there?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the uniform retail tenancy code is concerned, I think small businesses have been sold a pup. I think they really have. I think the minister has tried to dress this up by saying, `I'm sorry, the Commonwealth has got no power in this,' and clearly it has. He has tried to say, `I'll go and have a talk to the state governments and we will try to redress some of the issues there.' But it simply is not going to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again congratulate the minister for the recommendations on legislative protection against unconscionable conduct. As I said to him a little earlier, in football parlance&mdash;we are all using that at the moment because of the grand finals at the weekend&mdash;he has `done good, played strong'.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rugby league on this particular occasion. What he has done by playing strong is put in the recommendations that the Reid committee wanted on unconscionable conduct, with a few minor variations. Of course, we have to see the legislation, but he has actually done it. The minister has also put in a mandatory code, underpinned by changes to the Trade Practices Act, for franchising. Again, we welcome that. I have a couple of concerns regarding that. He made mention in his speech here this afternoon of giving this new organisation that he has established a first chore to go away and come up with a definition of franchising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that, after all these years, after all the inquiries to which he 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8776"> referred that happened under us, as a result of what happened overseas, and because of the information in the document by the Motor Trades Association of Australia that I referred to, he would know that those definitions are already there&mdash;it is not a difficult thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's predecessor, the member for Forrest, cut the funding for what was then the Australian Franchising Code Council. He cut $2 million from the budget as an offered&hyphen;up saving for the new body that was created. Is he going to reinstate funding for this new franchising council that he has developed? Not only that: what is he going to do about the replacement that has now been established called the Franchising Council of Australia&mdash;a revamped FANS? Of course, it lost all its money as a result of Geoff Prosser's action. Where does that organisation fit into this? Has there been consultation with them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to go back to retail tenancy matters and recommendation 2.1 on a uniform retail tenancy code. It says that the minister, in coming up with a uniform retail tenancy code, did not just have consultations with the Property Council of Australia and the Australian Retailers Association. I have to tell you that a lot of small businesses will tell you that the Australian Retailers Association does not represent them. This recommendation actually goes on to spell out another half a dozen organisations, as a minimum, that should have been consulted when coming up with a uniform retail tenancy code. Clearly this minister did not do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the new legislation for a franchising code of practice is concerned&mdash;I gather that will be coming not too far down the track&mdash;we would ask whether or not the dispute resolution adviser position that the minister talked about creating as part of the code of practice will have a statutory role. How will the position be established? I ask the minister to address those matters when he is speaking at the second reading stage or when the legislation to create the changes to the Trade Practices Act in respect of franchising is introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, we do not want any more discussions about franchising&mdash;it has all been done. Let us bring the legislation in and let us 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have a look at it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The oil industry is an extension of that. The mandatory code of practice that has been proposed is an excellent principle. Again, I congratulate the minister for going ahead with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 3.2 deals with the future of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act. What future do those particular acts have? The minister made no mention of that, from my reading of what I have been given today. I cannot see any mention of that. I would like to know what will happen as far as that recommendation of the report is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of misuse of market power; again, there will be more consultation with state and territory governments. You have to ask the question: what happens if one of the recalcitrant state and territory governments does not like any of this? When consultations take place on areas such as retail tenancy and misuse of market power, what happens if the government of the day in South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland or wherever says, `Look, I'm sorry. We don't like what you are talking about. We don't like those mandatory codes. We're not going to be stood over by the Commonwealth government'? Again, a number of waterings down have occurred in the recommendation specifically made by the Reid committee. I think these are questions that are worth asking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has also been a watering down in respect of small business finance. In the speech that was delivered by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business this afternoon, he talked about the government accepting, in principle, the Reid committee's recommendation that the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman's scheme and the banking code of conduct should be extended from unincorporated small business to include small business which is incorporated. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will advise the financial industry of this decision and invite immediate consultation and appropriate definition of small business for these purposes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If you do not know what small business is now, when will you know?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8777">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman's scheme and the code of practice in banking already. What do you mean when you say you have to invite them to participate? I know that they are voluntary organisations established largely by the banking industry, but the job of governments is to jawbone these organisations and say to them, `We would like you to do the right thing in respect of these recommendations.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem that none of that has happened. This is why I said a little earlier that, although there is a lot of in&hyphen;principle acceptance of the recommendations of the Reid committee report, when it comes to the actual `where do we go next?', there is still to be a lot of talking and a lot of discussion with state and territory governments and no guarantees yet that they will agree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that, in the four months that this government have had, they would have been out talking. I would have thought that they would have called a meeting of small business ministers&mdash;unlike the last one that Geoff Prosser went to when he excused himself because of his conflict of interest. This minister could have sat down with all his counterparts from the states and territories and thrashed this out. But it has not happened. The response today says, `We'll get to it later. We'll do it later.' Whilst it is fine and well to say, `We adopt all these ideas in principle,' actually putting them into practice might be a little bit more difficult for this minister than he envisages. We will certainly be keeping an eye on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said a little earlier, in respect to many of these issues that were outlined in the minister's speech I think this government has done reasonably well. But there is some devil in the detail. There is a question mark over how some of these issues will be delivered down the track. For example, there are still some unanswered questions about access to low cost justice. It is all dressed up in here, but there are some questions about educational opportunities for small business people. What is being said is, `We are not going to duplicate what the states do, and if the states are doing something, we will not get involved.' But, again, no discussion has occur 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> red with the states and the Commonwealth at this stage to say what is necessary to give that education to small business people, even if they are starting up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing to see that money is being put in; it is pleasing to see that there are going to be commissioners put in place at the ACCC specifically for small business. I give a big tick to those items, because I think this is an excellent way for enforcement to be done, provided that the legislation that comes in here gives those benchmarks and gives the teeth that the minister has promised it will. We need to see all of that. We need to see that small businesses and micro&hyphen;businesses are going to find a balance as a result of this government's response to the recommendations of the Reid committee report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From our perspective, I say to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business that he has done well to get unconscionable conduct provisions and changes to the Trade Practices Act through his caucus and his cabinet. He has done well to talk about the issues of franchising with similar messages. He has done well with respect to the oil industry. He has done well with respect to misuse of market power. He has done reasonably well with respect to small business finance, although most of it depends on jawboning, and there is no compulsion in any of the elements in a lot of those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where the minister has failed abysmally is with respect to retail tenancy laws and retail tenancy uniform codes&mdash;particularly in shopping centres, whether they be in strips or regional shopping centres. The legislation which could have addressed that had been sitting in this place since May of last year, yet it was not picked up by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, when the legislation comes in, we reserve our right to see that it does all the good things that today the minister has claimed it will do. If we find that it does not go far enough, we reserve the right to move amendments to that legislation. If we believe that retail tenancy laws need to be beefed up, I put on notice here today that we will reserve our right to move amendments to enforce that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our view, those hundreds of thousands of micro&hyphen;businesses&mdash;small business people out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8778"> there in retail tenancy situations&mdash;are looking for help, for justice and for support. I think what they will find here, as I said earlier, is that they have been sold a pup. I think what we will find is that they will say, `This looks pretty good.' It is all dressed up in nice glossy documents with the faces of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business splashed all over them. There are a few press releases to go out to regional areas of Australia and there are a few little glossies about what is going on. But when you read the fine detail, perhaps it is not as glossy as people think it will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the House for the opportunity to make some comments on this matter on behalf of the opposition this afternoon. When we see the legislation which is to be introduced here later today, our comments may not be as generous as they have been so far. But in the main, I think the minister has done a pretty reasonable job in getting this stuff through.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On 15 October last year I made a statement in parliament about establishing the Defence Efficiency Review. The DER reported to me in March this year with a set of 70 recommendations and findings proposing a radical Defence overhaul.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On April 11 this year I announced the Defence reform program&mdash;a plan to put these 70 findings and recommendations into effect. Today I want to report to the parliament on our progress in implementing the Defence reform program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the program is to free financial resources for re&hyphen;investment in training, operations and equipment. It is refocusing Defence back on its primary task&mdash;to maintain and develop combat capability. It has already speeded up the decision&hyphen;making process and cut the size of administration and areas not related to supporting military capability.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Rationale for the Review</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I talk about the reform program's implementation, I want to outline the reasons why we undertook such a major task. The first reason was that there was a pressing need to improve the speed and quality of decision making within the Defence Force organisation and to reduce the size of bureaucratic structures which had developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason was that, over the last decade, Defence funding has been under great pressure. In that period it has declined as a percentage of Commonwealth outlays from 8.8 per cent down to 8.2 per cent. At a time when spending in the areas of health, education and social security have significantly increased, Defence spending declined from 2.6 per cent of gross national product in 1986 to 1.9 per cent in 1997. These factors have made it enormously difficult for Defence to maintain high levels of operational and training activities, and to buy and modernise equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the Efficiency Review, the Defence organisation was potentially facing a severe budget crisis brought on by a need to replace ageing equipment reaching block obsoles 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8779"> cence. The problem would have peaked after the turn of the century when our need to address that block obsolescence for major equipment across the services far exceeded the levels of resources likely to be available. The Defence Department was drifting towards a point where the only choice was to cut capability. Of course that is no realistic choice at all.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mixed record of reform</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government and the Defence organisation itself had been making attempts to reform, mainly through the force structure review and the commercial support program. The commercial support program in particular had made an important breakthrough in proving that the Defence Force could rely on the wider community to provide a range of support activities. The previous government also reduced Defence personnel numbers&mdash;some 15,000 between 1990 and 1996. None of these changes, however, was sufficiently far reaching to bring about the level of savings to overcome the problem I have described. They also did not address the need for major structural reform, and to reshape the organisation to focus on its key roles and functions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Key Reform Program Outcomes and Objectives</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Defence reform program is designed to overcome these limitations. First, and most importantly, these reforms will maximise the focus of all Defence activities on promoting the security of Australia and its interests. In particular we recognise that maintaining and developing combat capabilities is uniquely the role of the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ADF will, of course, continue to put a high priority on peacetime activities such as high level strategic dialogues, regional defence cooperation and peacekeeping. But our capacity to do these things comes from having a credible military force&mdash;one our friends and allies know is highly capable&mdash;and that depends on being able to pay for it. The performance of each area in Defence is now directed towards and assessed against its contribution towards achieving this mission.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Service Chiefs</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second outcome is to achieve a more corporate approach to Defence planning and decision making by establishing a joint and integrated Defence headquarters staff. We have enhanced the roles of the chiefs of service in strategic level policy development, and streamlined the Defence committee process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some uninformed people have claimed that because we have reduced the personal staffs of the chiefs they have lost their authority. That confuses mere ownership of resources with effective power. Under the system we have put in place the service chiefs have, for the first time since the military departments were brought together in 1975, real decision making authority in the Defence headquarters. This was an essential change, one our predecessors lacked the fortitude to make, and one which already has improved the speed and quality of decision making.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Long&hyphen;term planning</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A third key outcome of the Defence reform program is to establish an effective system for long&hyphen;term defence planning and capability development. This is necessary for us to make the most productive use of the resources to be freed by the reform program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our last key outcome relates to the management approach we need to realise substantial efficiency gains. We must move many elements of the Defence organisation away from the belief that they need to own and control the support services and organisations which support them. The difficulty with this old approach is that it leads to very costly and substantial duplication and overlapping of activities&mdash;for example, running three separate logistic support organisations, four personnel management organisations and so on.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Rationalising Support Functions</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Defence reform program maximises our rationalisation of support functions by creating common support organisations for education and training, logistics, personnel management, corporate information and corporate support. In some instances elements of these functions will then be market tested in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8780"> normal way through the commercial support program. Of course, the true measure of the reform program will be at the end of the three&hyphen; to four&hyphen;year implementation process and we have made all of the savings and efficiencies, changed the way Defence does its business, and enhanced our military capabilities. I am happy to say that the department has made very rapid progress down that track.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Savings target</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Defence has put a great deal of effort into assessing the cost and savings estimates in the Efficiency Review. The department identified some small areas of double counting of potential savings. However, these reductions have been offset by increases in the estimates of other efficiency gains, especially in relation to speeding up the commercial support program. Overall, the Defence reform program is still targeted to achieve one&hyphen;off savings of $500 million, and mature ongoing annual savings of at least $900 million. So the department's own costing of the DER recommendations already shows that we will considerably exceed the review's original estimate for recurring savings, which was $770 million. Depending on the final outcomes of market testing initiatives, these annual savings could be as high as $1,000 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Personnel Numbers</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes of this magnitude cannot be achieved without some impact on personnel numbers. Large scale change can be difficult for those involved. I accept that the reform program has made big demands of people in Defence, and some continuing adjustments will be necessary. The current estimate is that there will be 7,800 service and civilian personnel reductions. It is difficult to be precise about the eventual reduction in numbers because the final figure depends on the extent to which in&hyphen;house options succeed in commercial support program testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At least 2,000 of the affected service positions will be redirected from support to combat and combat related functions. Although the total number of people in uniform and Defence civilians will reduce, ADF personnel in combat and combat related jobs will increase as resources are redirected through elimination of duplication and stream 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lining of administrative functions. Since the end of World War II, the Australian military has relied on high technology to make up for small numbers. A country of 20 million people will never generate mass military forces in peacetime.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Enhancing military capabilities</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Defence reform program savings will be used to support new and enhanced combat capabilities, increased preparedness and competitive remuneration for service and civilian personnel.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later this year, I will make a separate statement to the House on the strategic review which has now been completed. This document presents the decision making and priority framework, showing how the reform program savings will be spent.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of capability priorities are obvious, including:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> acquisition of airborne early warning and control aircraft;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> increasing the weapons and sensor capability of the surface fleet;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> implementing the plan for restructuring the Australian Army with helicopter and ground transport;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> exploring submarine capability options; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> modernising the FA18s and F111s.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That by no means is the limit of the equipment areas being addressed. We will put more money towards exercising and operations. The government has identified shortfalls in training and readiness which need more funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the savings will be devoted to improving Reserve force training. The enhancement of the Reserves through our plan for restructuring the Australian Army is a particularly important Defence initiative. This follows the Army's own openly critical self&hyphen;assessment of their capability deficiencies in their `Army 21' study. Army will trial new concepts of embedded combat support elements, and new arrangements for integrating regular and reserve forces. The plan will make the Army more responsive, more mobile, better trained and better equipped to handle a range of contingencies, from the defence of Australia to offshore operations. And we need, as well, to properly compensate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8781"> our military and civilian Defence personnel for their demanding work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Continuous improvement</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reform objectives and outcomes I have outlined today and the recommendations of the Defence Efficiency Review will be achieved over a three&hyphen; to four&hyphen;year period. The details of the implementation of each of these initiatives will, of necessity, be developed progressively by Defence managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reform program is concerned with setting clear objectives and achieving targets, not with setting out detailed prescriptions. Far from being a static exercise, I hope the reform program will identify further areas where changes and efficiencies can be made. Our Defence people should think of reform as a dynamic and continuous process, making defence more flexible and responsive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Progress in implementation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the five months since I announced the Defence reform program, there has been a great deal of progress. The Defence budget has been developed and presented in the new program structure which puts the emphasis on defence outputs. The senior management teams of the new programs are in place and work is well advanced on detailed implementation planning and the initial phase of reform implementation itself. These implementation plans will be refined progressively in the light of experience with the actual conduct of the reform program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new higher Defence management and committee processes are in place and operating. The chiefs of service are already participating to a much greater extent than before in Defence policy considerations at the strategic level. I am determined that process should continue. The effectiveness of the new Defence headquarters and command arrangements was tested in the recent Cambodian situation. The verdict is that the arrangements worked extremely well. I congratulate those involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I acknowledge it has been a difficult adjustment, the required 20 per cent reductions in senior Defence Force positions&mdash;that is, from the rank of Colonel (equivalent) and above&mdash;has been made. These are being 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matched by the same reduction in the civilian areas of the Department of Defence as the implementation of the reform program proceeds. The planning baseline for the reform program has been re&hyphen;validated and the overall scale of expected savings has been confirmed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Programs are now being advised of their specific savings targets, and detailed consideration of the reallocation of realised savings has begun through the strategic review. Clear and accountable `client&hyphen;provider' relationships are being established between the commanders of Defence operational units and the providers of supporting activities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Defence facilities</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the disposal of the Navy property Tresco in Sydney, a start has been made on the reform program's asset sales. This is a particularly important area. The Australian Defence Force must be allowed to modernise its basing and facilities around the country. We cannot have a Defence Force able to fight on the 21st century battlefield operating out of 19th and early 20th century facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course all Defence facilities disposals are managed through an extensive process of community consultation, taking heritage and environmental values into account. The Defence Forces have been magnificent custodians of their facilities&mdash;many of which are valuable parts of the country's national heritage. But the ADF cannot be turned into a museum custodian for every one of its assets. Their role is to ensure the defence of Australia and its interests. Our facilities plan is an essential part of the overall reform program agenda.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">70 Findings and Recommendations</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I can report that there were 70 findings and recommendations in the original Defence Efficiency Review:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> of the 18 findings, 16 have been studied in detail and will be used to direct future planning.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> of the 49 recommendations, action is complete on 14 and is well under way on a further 31.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Demanding task</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not underestimate the extent of the reform task ahead of us in Defence. The task 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8782"> is difficult and complex and will require continuing commitment. By way of illustration, over 10,000 people will be transferred to new programs within Defence as part of this year's additional estimates. These personnel represent more than 12 per cent of the total strength of the Defence organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking to the continued welfare of these and other affected personnel is a clear responsibility of ministers, commanders and managers alike. Of equal importance will be the demonstrated productive use of these realised savings in enhancing defence capabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The experiences of the Defence Efficiency Review and my later visits to Defence establishments have confirmed to me that there is, in fact, great support for these changes across the Defence organisation. That does not surprise me because the vast majority of proposals for change in the efficiency review came from ADF and Defence civilians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The questions Defence people put to me are: `Why hasn't this happened sooner?' rather than `Why are we changing things now?'Contrary to some ill&hyphen;informed speculation, the effect of the reform program has been to boost morale in the Defence Force. Our Defence people understand the need to re&hyphen;emphasise their core role of enhancing combat capability. They are implementing the reform program with great enthusiasm. I have every confidence that the people of the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defence will use the reform program to enhance the ADF's capability and standing in the region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I think there are a number of important views which the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) and I share in relation to Defence issues. I think we both share a very strong respect for the men and women in the Australian Defence Force. We both share a desire to see the available funds efficiently and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> properly applied to the defence of Australia. We have a shared view about the need and desirability of improving our capability in the defence of Australia and, dare I say, I think we have a shared view, a realistic view, about the resources needed in order to achieve those outcomes. But we do not share the same view about the way in which we should go about achieving those outcomes. Specifically, we do not share the same view about the contribution which the Defence reform program and its parent, the Defence Efficiency Review, are contributing to that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say I am delighted to see the Defence reform program given some form here in this debate. For two rounds of Senate estimates committees the minister left the senior officers of the department swaying in the breeze in an effort to try to define for the Senate what it is that the Defence reform program was about. There was some embarrassment in watching senior Defence personnel simply unable to answer questions about what the DRP was. Although the minister had made many press statements about the issue, none&mdash;until today&mdash;sought to give it any form or definition. Belated though it is, I am pleased to see that the government has now tabled a document which gives some form to the concept of the Defence reform program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is necessary to go back and identify the genesis of the Defence reform program, which was the Defence Efficiency Review, that the minister announced following the election of the government. When that Defence Efficiency Review was announced in this parliament, I rose and, with some qualification, supported the establishment of the review. As I indicated, there is a shared view between the government and the opposition that it is important for resources to be allocated efficiently in Defence. It is a big organisation. It consumes about $10 billion a year from Treasury, and it is important that those funds are properly allocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I did flag at that time a concern, a concern that the nature of the membership of the committee might lead it to think that in their mind you can run a defence force efficiently in the same way you might run Coca-Cola or Western Mining or some other com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8783"> pany efficiently. Defence is not a business in the same sense as making coca-cola is. What is efficient business to Coca&hyphen;Cola is not efficient business in Defence. My concerns were highlighted by the composition of that committee. That committee of six consisted of only one person with any military experience and military knowledge. The committee consisted of an executive in the AMP Society, an executive at Western Mining, two Defence bureaucrats, one military person and even one failed National Party senator from Queensland. That is not the group of people whom I would recommend to make the sorts of judgments that they were required to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, at that time I lent support of the opposition for the establishment of the review because I thought it was an appropriate thing to do in assessing efficient application of resources. There are aspects of the Defence Efficiency Review, now the DRP, which I support and which go to improving the efficient use of the money. But there are a number of things in the DRP which the minister has referred to today that I have grave concerns about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me set a few of the myths clear at the outset. In talking about getting resources to the sharp end and improving capability, we should understand that the DRP, the Defence reform program, will actually reduce the number of full-time soldiers in Australia to its lowest level since 1961. In fact, the total number of full&hyphen;time uniformed troops in the ADF&mdash;that is, Army, Navy and Air Force combined&mdash;will be reduced under this program to its lowest level since 1963. We need to understand up&hyphen;front that the rhetoric about capability is actually mirroring, or hiding, a very substantial reduction in full-time troop capabilities, and that is in addition to the reductions that were in the last two budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last two budgets cut out in the order of 2,000 full-time military positions. In all, we will see about 5,000 full-time troops&mdash;military personnel, not civilian personnel&mdash;cut under the DRP on top of the 2,000 or so that were cut in the last budget and the one before. This is not a statement about expanding military personnel; this is a statement about reducing them. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to repeat also the context in which this review occurs within the defence debate. It occurs at a point in time when, for some 18 months now, we have seen a raft of uncoordinated decisions that, in spite of the minister's claims today, have rocked morale. What we have today is an effort to turn that raft of uncoordinated, unconnected decisions of the last 18 months into some sort of plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister announced today that, having cobbled those decisions of the last 18 months into a plan now, after the event, we will soon have a strategic review. In the context of defence planning, that strategic review amounts to the goal. That strategic review is your statement as a government of a nation as to how you see your defence strategic circumstances in the region and the world. Any sensible appraisement of how this business should have been done would have put those in the reverse order. The minister has got it all back to front in dealing with that. There should have been a clear, concise, strategic analysis followed by a force structure review. That should have then been followed by the decisions necessary to implement it. That was the model that was followed by Labor in office. It is the model, I might add, that is followed by like governments around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not aware of an example anywhere in the world where a government has set about this sort of efficiency review on this sort of scale without already having determined its strategic review. If you look at the case of the United States, when it went through a massive downsizing a few years ago it did precisely what I just recommended. It did precisely what the former Labor government did. It identified its strategic circumstance in the world. Having done that, it then set about scaling its troops down because it had reassessed its strategic analysis. This government has done it back to front. Some time later this year we will get a strategic analysis which will either be written to suit the decisions already taken or hopefully will coincide with them. In either case, we have had the cart before the horse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to some of the specifics that are mentioned in the document today. I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8784"> briefly want to touch on the issue of the service chiefs. When the changes were announced earlier this year to the role of the service chiefs, the position which the government and the minister put were more public relations spin than substance. That was not just borne out by political point scoring; it was borne out by the strongly held views of many people in uniform. It was borne out by the public knowledge, as it became, that the chiefs had a meeting with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to express their view about the impending DER release, not least of all being their place in the situation.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="McLACHLAN" NAMEID="HT4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HT4">Mr McLachlan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which I arranged.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the minister arranged for the meeting to occur. But the simple fact is that there was very serious concern only a few months ago that the chiefs of the services&mdash;of the Army, Air Force and Navy&mdash;were going to be sidelined under this new arrangement, sandwiched between a new and more powerful Chief of the Defence Force, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, Headquarters Australian Theatre, which had operational responsibilities for the actual tactical deployment of Army, Air Force and Navy combined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chiefs do have an important contribution to make. I am happy to hear the minister reassure the House that the chiefs are in fact playing a greater role in the strategic policy formulation and advice which goes to government. Collectively, they&mdash;certainly all those that I have had the pleasure of being associated with in my time in this place&mdash;are people of outstanding ability and integrity and, possibly more important than that from the minister's perspective, they are people of great knowledge and skill whose advice should be sought and, more often than not, should be heeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the minister has confirmed that that role for them is evolving. I might add that I think the changes do not of themselves do that. If anything, the changes run the risk of distancing the chiefs from it because it still relies on the CDF's determination as to the extent to which they participate. I do not think the changes gave them a greater participation, but if in fact in practice 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is occurring and that is the desire on the part of government then it is a desire that is shared by me and the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The list of capability priorities that the minister outlined to the parliament today I thought had one notable exclusion, which the minister will no doubt guess: the Collins submarines 7 and 8.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr McLachlan interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought it was very cleverly identified in the minister's statement as `exploring submarine capability options'. `Exploring submarine capability options' is code for things like: do you double crew them? What weapons do you put on them? I think it is code for saying, `We want to try to sweep submarines 7 and 8 under the carpet.' I think submarines 7 and 8 are important and they should be in that list of priorities. Kim Beazley and I have on a number of occasions made plain the Labor Party's commitment to it as an important asset for the defence of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to urge the government to revisit that issue sooner rather than later because time is running out. If we are going to actually get submarines 7 and 8, a decision has to be taken in a time frame of months, not years. If we do not do it in a time frame of months, we will lose some of the skills that are presently available in the organisation to acquire submarines 7 and 8 at the cost that we would want. If we take a decision after that, we will incur a cost premium, and that is not efficient management of limited resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Troop capability is one of the areas that concerns me greatly out of the DRP. The proposals that the government is pursuing under the DRP are going to degrade, and at this time are degrading, the capability of Army. Full&hyphen;time numbers are being cut now. They are being cut as we speak. They are being cut in this budget, they were cut in the last budget and they will be cut in the next budget. Full&hyphen;time numbers are being cut now, but the reserve capability, which the minister rightly refers to as so critical, is actually going to take some years to reach the required levels. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the next few years, the plan that the minister and the government have embarked upon will, without doubt, reduce capability at least of the land forces. There is no sensible transitional plan that the minister has put in place for these major changes in the organisation of our land forces. So we have a circumstance where we take a couple of thousand full-time troops out of the system before we actually improve the capability of the reserves who are there in the system and who over time, it is argued, will fill that void. That is fine in the long term if it all works&mdash;and I want to say something about that in a minute because I do not think they have the prescription to make it all work either&mdash;but what is beyond doubt is that in the short term they degrade capability, and that is no way to do business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very important issues about reserves. Reserves do play an increasingly important role in the defence of Australia, and that is a position which the opposition supports. In government it was something that the Labor Party pursued and, in many respects, introduced to a new level. You cannot have reserves playing an increasingly important role in the defence of Australia unless you address the fundamental problems that individual reservists face when the Defence Force requires them to do more. Reservists have other things in their lives to do. Very typically, they have full&hyphen;time jobs somewhere in the private sector doing things outside of defence. Like many others, they have families and other responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most significant things that needs to be sorted out before you go down the track of getting rid of your full&hyphen;time people is the civilian interests of reserves. You need to make sure that their civilian, employment and educational interests and their remuneration arrangements are actually protected and sorted out before you decide that you are going to get rid of the full&hyphen;time people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the shames that this government has in that respect is that the minister with primary responsibility for that, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), has been sitting on a major report on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this issue since August last year. If it is such a priority, and it should be&mdash;I have no doubt that is exactly what the minister has been advised because you cannot make the Defence Force work unless you address this problem, particularly under Army 21 and, more so, with the DRP pace of reform&mdash;why has the minister for personnel been sitting on a report for more than a year without giving a response? I would not worry about any action, I would settle for a response, but there is not even a response, let alone an outcome&mdash;an action. So much for it being, as the minister said, `a particularly important Defence initiative'. Yes, Minister, it is a particularly important Defence initiative and the sooner you get on with it the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This situation has been made worse by the abolition of the Ready Reserve. I make no bones about my support for the Ready Reserve scheme. It produced the best trained and the best equipped brigade in the Australian Army as at January this year. It was on the shortest notice to deploy of any brigade and it was abolished by this government against the advice of the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that in my home town of Brisbane&mdash;in fact in my electorate, which might be one reason I have more than a passing interest in it&mdash;the two army brigades were abolished. The 6 Brigade of Ready Reserve was abolished, even though it was the peak brigade in the Army. The 7 Brigade, also in Brisbane, was abolished by this government. The government replaced them with one single brigade that it called a task force. That was a show of mirrors and smokescreens that did not fool anyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The short of it is that there were two brigades in Brisbane, now there is one, and the government has called it a task force. What was two became one and, in the process, we lost the most capable brigade in the Australian Defence Force in January of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister made comments about morale and claimed that troops are happy about the changes and welcome them. I must say that that strikes me to be like the story of the emperor with no clothes. Either he has a myopic view when he visits the bases he goes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8786"> to or people tell him only that which they think he wishes to hear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments I made in the MPI last week were not simply a question of point scoring. They were views genuinely held from a range of inputs across the community, across the services and across different parts of Australia. If the minister honestly believes that these changes to which he has referred in his statement are warmly received and are boosting morale, then he is being very selective in the advice he takes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go to the question of defence industry, because there were some comments in the minister's statement about defence industry. I must say that I find any comments this government makes on defence industry to be pretty hollow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, the minister with primary responsibility for this is the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel and the truth of the matter is that the minister has not actually announced an industry policy. Here we are 18 months into the coalition government, halfway through their term&mdash;even without the events of last week, they are halfway through their term&mdash;and the minister has not actually announced a policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened is that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel advertised in the papers, asking anyone out there who has some ideas to let her know because next March she wants to announce a policy. Next March&mdash;two years after the government would have been elected and two years after she became minister&mdash;she is going to announce a policy, I assume, provided she gets lots of ideas from the public appeal for thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the Minister for Defence to come into the House today and talk about defence industry, when Minister Bishop has not to this day announced one skerrick of policy and was in this last month publicly advertising for someone to give her some ideas about it, is laughable. So I am afraid the comments on defence industry are hollow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make one reference about the situation of the CDF as the employer. I know there are arguments for and against this and it is an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issue that has been around for some time. I think the decision the government has taken to make CDF the employer is fraught with a whole range of problems. It is an issue which we on this side will watch carefully as it progresses. I trust that the problems that are created by having the CDF as employer will be carefully worked through rather than hastily imposed, as many things are within the DRP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to quickly contrast this with Labor's reforms. Under the Labor Party's reforms of the defence forces, we saw a gradual and measured way of getting efficiencies without destroying morale and without compromising capability. Those changes, according to the minister's own acknowledgment in former speeches, delivered $450 million per annum in savings, achieved without compromising capability and without destroying morale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is now proposing to make cuts which have a dollar value of more than twice that amount and to do it posthaste. He thinks that can be done without degrading capability, without impacting on morale and without impacting on the way Defence does its business. It cannot be done that way, and I think the minister would do well to revisit some of the Labor government's actions over the last few years and the way in which those savings were implemented by Labor. They were done without the sort of clumsy chaos that this government has created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The DRP is the accountants' answer to what is a very complex situation. Going back to my earlier point, this is the solution you get from business people who think they are good at running Coca&hyphen;Cola and Western Mining. They try to apply those principles with zeal to the defence forces and they do not always fit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I get a bit concerned when I hear senior people involved in Defence in support of this process say to me, `We could get rid of army logistics because companies like Woolworths store just as many items and transport them all over the country overnight. Why don't we just get them to do it, because they can do it cheaper than we in the defence forces can do it?' I start to shudder when people involved 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8787"> in the process put that forward as the sort of analogy that they think is the road ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be possible to get Woolworths, Brambles or someone else in the private sector to do the storage for many defence items. In some areas, that is sensible. The minister has acknowledged the commercial support program, the CSP, went down that track under us, but it went down it in a gradual way&mdash;not with the bull&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;China&hyphen;shop approach this government has adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to go down that track, that is fine, as long as there are no bullets flying around. I am not sure the people working in Woolworths will be too keen turning up on the Army doorstep when the bullets are flying around. There actually has to be a wartime capability in this. You can take the CSP program, the commercialisation of Defence, only so far. If you take the commercialisation program beyond that, what you do is end up with a defence force that can fight a war for a week. The pace and extent to which the government is now proposing to go stretches those boundaries. It takes us to the limits where we will end up fighting a war for only a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are only two other points I wish to make. Property sales were mentioned by the minister today, and I am pleased that he did this. I thought the one he chose&mdash;Tresco&mdash;was interesting, though. It is one of the commander's houses. It is all very well to go and bag the senior brass for living in a nice old house&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 April 1996, a tragedy occurred in Australia that is etched very deeply in the memories of us all. That was the day that we heard some 35 people had been killed and 20 wounded by a lone gunman spraying bullets around a peaceful part of Tasmania where, for years, tourists had gone with their families and friends. The youngest victim, Madeleine, was only three. Everyone knew someone&mdash;a wife, a daughter, a neighbour, a husband&mdash;who knew someone else who had lost a loved one in the massacre at Port Arthur. People became angry. They asked, `How could it possibly be that a man like that had access to that sort of gun and that sort of ammunition and was able to wreak that sort of havoc on innocent people?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The details of the Port Arthur massacre became a reminder of the Hoddle Street and the Queen Street shootings 10 years before and the shootings in Strathfield in Sydney in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nation looked to our leader, John Howard, who, speaking as the voice of the people, made a commitment that this government would do everything possible to reduce the chances of such a tragedy ever happening again. He knew that there would be opposition. His resolve was tested to the full over the weeks and months to follow. In particular, he understood the impact on the law&hyphen;abiding gun owners of Australia&mdash;the people who had fully subscribed to the laws and regulations of their states. In the case of Victoria, for example, gun owners were already required to have their firearms locked up and their ammunition separated, and they had to be licensed and registered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard also understood the impact on rural and farming communities where land&hyphen;holders who have responsibility for livestock use firearms as a tool of the trade to `take 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> care' of vermin and, when necessary, to destroy stock in humane circumstances. He understood all of that and he did his best over those early weeks in the parliament to emphasise that, despite the impact on the law&hyphen;abiding gun owners of Australia, it was essential that we had a regime across all states and territories that was consistent; that would ensure that every gun owner in Australia was checked in terms of their fitness and need to own certain categories of firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was obvious to our Prime Minister that, despite the hard times and the incredible backlash at times from people like the sporting shooters and those in parts of rural communities, for the good of the nation it was important for him to hold firm and take us from a situation of tragedy to one where at the end of the day we could say those deaths had not been in vain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only several weeks later, in March, that the specially convened meeting of the Australasian police ministers council agreed that all states and territories introduce consistent gun laws across Australia. At that first meeting there was agreement to a set of common principles so that the regulations in each state would have consistency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, 30 September 1997, is a milestone in that post&hyphen;Port Arthur commitment to do all that is possible to make Australia one of the safest nations on earth in terms of gun ownership control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we are marking the end of the national buyback scheme and the end of the amnesty on prohibited firearms. In a massive exercise across states and territories in Australia, hundreds and thousands of men and women have peacefully handed back firearms that they have purchased over the years according to the laws of their states. As well they handed in long prohibited guns under the protection of the amnesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all, 601,000 firearms have been taken out of the community to centres across Australia where those firearms have been destroyed. In all, over $292 million has been paid out in compensation to the owners of those firearms and to those whose livelihood was in the selling or maintaining of guns and ammuni 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8789"> tion supply. So the dealers too will be compensated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All working Australians can share in the achievement of today. The dollars that were available to help pay this compensation and make these centres workable came from a one&hyphen;off Medicare levy that was raised through legislation in this House. This is a day that all of us can be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response of my own electorate is an example of how rural Australians pull their weight, especially in difficult circumstances. When times are tough rural Australians will still make their contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the city of Shepparton, the home of sporting shooting, we have had over 15,000 firearms&mdash;both prohibited and non&hyphen;prohibited&mdash;handed in to the local collection centre. Over $7 million has been paid in compensation to those 15,000 firearm owners. It does not mean the end of sporting shooting in the region. The state laws of Victoria, like the laws throughout the rest of Australia, allow sporting shooters to continue in sports with categories of firearms that are permitted, as long as they are shooting in a highly regulated, safe environment. In the small town of Kerang, with a few thousand people&mdash;the home of duck shooting in the state of Victoria&mdash;some 800 non-prohibited and 200 prohibited weapons were handed in. In return, some $500,000 was paid in compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to acknowledge the enormous effort of my colleagues in this House and in the Senate who, over the weeks and months, especially in the March and April period following the tragedy in Port Arthur, spent hours explaining to our constituents just what this new gun law regime would mean and the need for universal and consistent laws throughout Australia. It was often hard for us when our sporting shooter fraternity or our farmers said, `But I have always been law abiding.' It came to be understood, however, that with the elimination of certain categories of guns from this country we would become a safer place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The education program that was used to support the buyback and compensation program was central to the outcomes we have achieved today. We did not simply stand back 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and offer money in return for guns to be handed back; we knew we had to change the culture of this country. We had to make sure that people checked the purchase of a gun for their son or daughter. In Australia, we now systematically ask the questions: do you need to own a gun? To what purpose do you need to put that firearm? If you do not have a legitimate purpose, if you are not going to undertake sporting shooting in a safe and regulated environment, then it is simply a fact that you do not need a firearm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today is a celebration for the whole of the nation: we have achieved a change of culture in this country. Research shows that a huge majority of people have supported the buyback and the compensatory regime. Information suggests that some 70 per cent of the firearms out there are now under some new control regime. All states and territories have consistent firearm licensing and regulation regimes. No more do we hear, with considerable concern, that someone has bought a Chinese assault rifle from Queensland and that they are going to bring it down to shoot some pigs in New South Wales. No more do we have to worry that another state south of Victoria has a regime where you can walk into the local shop and buy ammunition and a gun that today is prohibited on the mainland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, in Australia, the community can be more satisfied that if you own a firearm you understand the responsibility that goes with that ownership. You have been instructed to keep the firearm under lock and key and the ammunition in a safe place. You will have been required to go through a rigorous process to demonstrate that you know how to safely handle that firearm and you are a responsible and rational Australian citizen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Port Arthur was a tragedy. Before that, we had other examples of shooting tragedies. In Australia, we have a fairly safe society. In no way do we compare with the United States where families often have to raise their children behind security walls and where a lot of women believe that the safest thing to do after dark is to have a pistol in your purse. As a nation we celebrate the fact that, on the whole, we are one of the most secure count 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8790"> ries on earth. We have to work hard at keeping this environment. We have to make sure that our children understand that the gratuitous violence they see from time to time on television is an unreal circumstance and that, if they have anger and frustration in their lives, there are other ways to deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of this new gun control program, our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) recognised that it was not just a case of removing prohibited firearms from the community. He also stressed the need for us to review the issue of gratuitous violence portrayed in videos which are accessible to our children and our young people. He also understood the need for any mentally unwell in our communities to be better helped and supported so that in times of distress or at times when they are less responsible for their actions they do not find themselves with a firearm in their hands. We need to look at our screening programs. With the help of the medically trained, gun owner licensing bodies need to better identify those with a history of irrational behaviour. This may help to indicate where gun licences should not be issued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Twelve months after we set out on a very detailed program to make sure that the Australian population understood the need for a safer country and more rigorously regulated gun laws, we can say that we have been hugely successful. It is a great credit to our Prime Minister. As we would all recall, there was a great deal of opposition, especially from those in our regional communities who quite rightly protested that, as law&hyphen;abiding people, they had always been at the forefront as responsible gun owners. Unfortunately, the history of Port Arthur suggested that we had to be more careful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that when the Australian population realises that today is the last day of the compensation program, the last day of the amnesty, they will breathe a sigh of relief knowing that this process has taken an enormous number of firearms out of the community. One can look at the statistics on violence with the use of firearms and hope that in the future when people are frustrated and angry a firearm will not be so easily at their disposal. We can look to a safer future. I hope the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> surviving families and friends of those who were massacred at Port Arthur are thinking of their loved ones today. I believe that all the people in this House would hope that they understand that as a nation we have moved a long way in the 18 months since 28 April 1996.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in supporting this motion. I think the situation was summarised in an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  today:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the cumulative horror and disbelief felt by the public coalesced into a determination that Australia not allow a "gun culture" to take hold. It was this firm public resolution that John Howard articulated as a political leader. After some resistance, States and Territories agreed upon a systematic tightening of gun laws.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The editorial went on to say that the system:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . involves a new system of registration licensing, a system of uniformity across the nation and more effective exchange of information between the various police forces.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At the outset, I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) quite rightly did, and equally the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams), who obviously came under a fair amount of criticism during that period. The fact is that they had to persuade a number of more reluctant states to go along with the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if it is true that, if John Howard had not been the Prime Minister at the time, conservative forces in this country might not have had the courage to pursue this matter, it is equally true that they had the strong cooperation and support of the opposition. Historically, it is worth while referring to an article of 1 May 1996, written by John Cain about his experience in Victoria. In that article he commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our move to contain semi&hyphen;automatic weapons was challenged when, in March 1988, the Opposition majority in the Legislative Council used, for the first time, its power to overrule a Government regulation: it rejected the ban on semi&hyphen;automatic weapons.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He also spoke about the aftermath of the New South Wales election, the Unsworth defeat, which I think less perceptive commentators took as a referendum on gun laws rather than 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8791"> a referendum on the whole performance of the previous state Labor government. Mr Cain commented, that, after that election:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">support for further amendments to gun laws dissolved. The fear that the gun lobby had contributed to Unsworth's demise led to political jitters all around the country.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So today we should again record our congratulations to the government on what they undertook but, equally, face the reality that if they had not had the support of the opposition in implementing those measures then quite obviously they would not have occurred. In the history of gun laws in this country we see many instances of political opportunism rather than the needs of this country dictating what happened with gun laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this motion, having a very passionate interest in this policy area. In my maiden speech in the state assembly of New South Wales in September of 1984 I cited an article by Frank Zimring, who has been one of the leading US writers on gun laws. I had the pleasure, earlier this year, of corresponding with him on these matters. In that speech&mdash;and this is part of the answer to those people who have various defences of gun availability&mdash;I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interestingly, Frank Zimring calculated in an article for the University of Chicago Law Review that in Chicago's homicide cases, victims and attackers were related as family, friends and acquaintances in 68 per cent of cases, while 82 per cent had altercations&mdash;domestic, money and liquor&mdash;where intentions are frequently ambiguous and there is usually a lack of planning. Incidentally, he also indicated that over half the situations involved an offender or victim who had been drinking.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I further noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Returning to Zimring's work, he noted that 52 per cent of homicides involved the gun and yet there was a rate of 2.3 more serious knife to gun attacks&mdash;as determined from surrounding circumstances and nature of wounds. This meant that there was a five times greater death rate from gun than knife attack. He also provides convincing evidence for an understatement of knife attacks in police figures. These statistics are vital when one considers the prevalence of ambivalent intentions in many homicides. The effectiveness of guns as murder instruments leads to a higher proportion of success.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is part of the reason that we seek to tighten up gun laws in this country. In a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> further article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology</EMPHASIS>  in 1995, Zimring again returned to the lethal nature of guns in comparison to other instruments. He noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is novel in the recent past is the clear priority that life&hyphen;threatening violence has assumed in public concern about crime and its control. Until the 1990s, the focus of concern was with crime and criminals. Lethal violence was, of course, the worst case of crime that inspired community fear, but the larger problem was crime generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A more specific concentration on lethal violence leads to a greater emphasis on the role of firearms for a number of reasons. One is the question of relative prevalence: guns are known to be used in less than 5% of all index crimes in the United States, as the National Rifle Association is quick to remind us; but guns are involved in fully 70% of all criminal homicides. A shift in emphasis from crime to lethal violence makes firearms appear a much more important issue. A focus on lethal violence also steers attention to firearms because it concentrates attention on death as an especially problematic outcome; this helps direct attention to circumstances of attacks that might increase the chances that death will result. The rationale for special attention to homicide puts emphasis on factors that influence the death rates from assaults.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as previously mentioned, there is ample evidence that gun use is an important contributing cause to the high lethality produced by American violence. The serious assault rate in the United States is about 30% greater than in England. The homicide rate is 530% greater. Guns are an important part of the problem of lethal violence in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That does demonstrate the major reason for the need for licensing, registration and a general policy of restrictive availability&mdash;the fact that the gun is more lethal. Clearly, the statistics in regard to gun offences, suicides and accidental deaths show realities such as the fact that, whereas crimes in this country are far less prevalent in rural areas, coincidentally, in areas of higher gun availability and use&mdash;that is, rural areas of this country and of the United States&mdash;this is the one offence, the one problem, that is far greater in smaller communities. The fact of life is that the availability of guns has a clear correlation with young people suiciding and accidental shootings. Dr Arthur Kellerman, another expert in this field, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">US News and World Report</EMPHASIS>  of 15 August 1994 said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8792">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most gun homicides occur in altercations among family members, friends or acquaintances. In a heated dispute, few carefully weigh the legal consequences of their actions. They are too busy reaching for a weapon. If it's a gun, death is more likely to occur.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So this is the other relevant aspect that we really have to put strongly in this debate. It is also the reason why the government has acted in this way. The fact is that most of these deaths are not the result of the action of some armed criminals, and those against the restriction would say that these criminals would still obtain guns. Most of these deaths occur when neighbours become aggravated with each other and when there are domestic disputes in a household where a gun is easily available. That is the reality of where the gun is used most fully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, that is not to deny the sad reality of the pattern in the United States. Gun availability has reached the stage where it clearly has such a prevalent presence in the culture. That same <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">US News and World Report</EMPHASIS> of August 1994 reported that 35 per cent of Americans commented that guns in their very neighbourhood were a serious problem. A further staggering 47 per cent of respondents to that survey indicated that they thought the presence of guns was a serious problem in their local schools. It was also interesting that 37 per cent of people could comment that they had actually heard guns go off in their community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, if we do not do something about it&mdash;I think it is overdue; I think there should have been far more political courage far earlier&mdash;we do face that spiral evident in the United States, where there is a clear connection between gun ownership and people's attitudes to guns. There is a variety of surveys that show a clear connection between people's support of lax laws, no restrictions, and their ownership of weapons. So, as more and more people gain possession, you get a more and more entrenched group of people who are very determined to stop any kinds of changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the situation in the US where, as early as 1994, there were 260 million guns in the American marketplace&mdash;double the level of gun ownership as recently as 1970. A very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> large number of the people surveyed said they needed guns for self-protection. I, for one, question whether that is a good enough reason. In fact, 45 per cent of those in the United States who possess guns say that it is for personal protection. We do have to question a society which has reached the stage where vast numbers of people say that this is a significant social problem in their local communities and in their local schools. As it happens, more and more of them feel a need for self-protection, and more and more of them feel a need to obtain weapons. The spiral goes on, and it then impacts on people's attitudes toward the very need for restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another one of the claims is that guns do not kill people, individuals do. That ignores a statement of 2 May 1996 by Philip Alpers, who did a survey of the variety of mass killings in Australia and New Zealand. He noted in that survey that 73 per cent of the killers are now known to have had no previous history of mental illness; 87 per cent of the killers had no previous history of violent crime; two-thirds of the killers were licensed gun owners; 64 per cent of the victims died in a shooting where a military style semiautomatic was used. So in those 14 mass shootings over a period of 10 years in Australasia&mdash;which, unfortunately for those involved, involved the deaths of 124 people&mdash;there was no prior indication of the nature of the people. So to say that we can essentially have a policy which relies simply on weeding out a few of the more worrying individuals is not really the answer. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation was overdue. There was a meeting of the political parties in this country about it. I am pleased to say that there was determination on all sides. The government did come up with a scheme which, through the Medicare levy, was accomplished in a fairly intelligent fashion. We do have an opportunity here to ensure that the whole gun culture of the United States is not repeated in this country. We do have an opportunity to try to ensure that the changes put in place will do something to curtail that development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to cite very briefly in the last few minutes some of the other dimensions of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8793"> the problem in the United States. In an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">JAMA</EMPHASIS>, dated 12 June 1996, David Nelson noted that 10 per cent of adults lived in households with firearms that were always or sometimes stored loaded and unlocked. An estimated 6.2 per cent of households with children had firearms that were loaded and unlocked, and about 40,000 children lived in these households. Over 4.4 per cent of adults carried loaded firearms in the past month. Rural residents, males and those with less than a college education were the ones living in those households. So that is some indication of the degree of so-called preparedness of people who are involved with guns&mdash;which are, supposedly, to ensure protection of their own families&mdash;and the control in the household as to the storage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same journal, dated 12 June 1996, Nancy Sinauer looked at non-fatal firearm related injuries in US emergency departments during a two-year period. She noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of patients were male (87%) and aged 15 to 34 years (61%); 38% required hospitalisation. Injuries were most often to an extremity (73%), were self-inflicted (70%), involved a handgun (57%), and resulted during common gun&hyphen;related activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Further development of effective interventions are needed to reduce the risk of injury from unintentional discharge of a firearm during routine gun&hyphen;handling practices by those who own and use firearms. These injuries often occur during common gun&hyphen;related activities such as gun cleaning, loading/unloading, hunting, target shooting, and showing . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, once again, that is another aspect of this problem. Even those people who are the experts, even those people who say they do not need any controls, are in many cases in the United States, after examination of emergency ward entries related to gun problems, the sufferers. In conclusion, I commend the government for this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is only the second occasion in my relatively short parliamentary experience where we have had speakers from both sides of the House in accord. I recall the last occasion was also on the subject of the uniform firearm laws. On that occasion there 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was a considerable number of people in the House and, when the MPI was called on, large numbers on both sides of the House supported the matter of public importance debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) for her opening contribution and the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) for his careful contribution to the debate. As the member for Murray pointed out, it was the national tragedy at Port Arthur on 28 April last year which gave the necessary community and political resolve to put in place what had not been achieved despite attempts over many years&mdash;namely, a comprehensive system of laws relating to the registration and licensing of firearms and firearm owners across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The achievement of that goal, while only possible politically as a result of the tragedy at Port Arthur, was the result of a great deal of work and leadership from a number of people. As the member for Murray highlighted and as the member for Reid agreed, it was really the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that made it possible. He stood firm throughout the process of negotiation of uniform laws at times when uniformity appeared almost impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also in this connection I would like to commend those members and senators who were faced with the most significant opposition. They were mainly either members who were representing rural or regional electorates or senators who had their bases in those areas. Principal among them, of course, is the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), who stood firmly behind the Prime Minister in all that was done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The negotiations of the uniform laws took a number of months over a variety of different meetings. From my recollection it involved not only all the police ministers of the jurisdictions&mdash;the Commonwealth, the states and the territories&mdash;but also all the premiers and chief ministers as well as the Prime Minister. At the Police Ministers Council meetings, of which there were a number during 1996, there were significant contributions made by police commissioners and by senior officers of the different governments.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8794">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The firearms buyback draws to a close today. In the end, it is the Australian firearm owners to whom the community must be grateful. They have responded in an overwhelmingly positive manner to the new laws and have worked hard to make the buyback scheme a success. As the member for Murray pointed out, as of this morning more than 600,000 firearms had been handed in and more than $292 million had been paid to firearm owners. They are not the final figures in either case. It is anticipated that there will still be a significant number of firearms handed in as of today. Many will be surrendered on a contingent basis pending a licence application for category C or D being dealt with. It is anticipated that there may be rejections of some of those applications and, on that basis, the numbers may be even greater than they presently appear to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the money paid to firearm owners as compensation, an amount of $63 million has been paid to implement the buyback scheme and the accompanying education campaigns. This has been a necessary adjunct to the buyback scheme because without it the structure would not have been there to receive the firearms or to educate firearm owners in the need to comply with the rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dealers have been the subject of special consideration. As yet there is a great deal of work to be done in compensating those dealers whose business has dropped in value as a result of the uniform firearm laws. Their applications will be processed in the coming months and it is anticipated that it will take until the middle of next year for them to be completed. It will be only then that we will know how much of the money raised by the special Medicare increase from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent in the course of the last financial year will be left over. At this stage it is not anticipated that there will be a great deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Murray mentioned the independent research conducted by Newspoll on behalf of the government. This has clearly shown that the buyback has been a success in removing the bulk of the now prohibited firearms from the community. It has shown also that there is a fundamental change in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community attitudes towards dangerous firearms. The research was conducted in June and July of this year and involved surveys of a statistically significant group of 2,400 people aged 18 years and over across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The research found that about three-quarters of Australians who had in the previous 12 months owned firearms which are now prohibited under the new laws had by then already handed in those firearms under the buyback scheme. For more than 18 months, firearm owners have regularly reported to Newspoll that they intended to comply with the new rules. The percentage of firearm owners who said that they intended to comply ranged from 70 per cent some nine months ago to more than 80 per cent towards the close of the campaign. The research shows that the vast majority of the 1.2 million adult Australians who do own a firearm now own a legal firearm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overwhelming positive result of the 1996 national firearm agreement and the amnesty buyback is in those respects a very positive one for the nation. Since 10 May 1996 each state and territory in Australia has instituted the most comprehensive reform of firearm laws in Australian history. The buyback has been successful in delivering the first step towards safe, responsible and legal ownership of firearms under clearly defined and strengthened laws across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the May agreement, differing or non-existent registration and licensing laws meant that there were no accurate figures on the number of firearms in Australia. The Newspoll research shows that there are substantially fewer firearms than the four to 10 million predicted by some opponents to the new laws. The research indicates that there are approximately 2.5 million firearms in private ownership in Australia, that is, 2.1 per firearm owner for the 1.2 million&hyphen;odd who own firearms. It represents a significant reduction in the number of firearm owners in Australia by more than 100,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The research indicated that there is an incredible awareness of the new laws; it is virtually universal, with 96 per cent of those surveyed being aware of the laws. Important 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8795"> ly, the research indicated strong support for firearms reform. Seventy&hyphen;eight per cent of all adult Australians statistically are in favour in the laws and 56 per cent of people are strongly in favour of the new laws. The removal of dangerous firearms from our communities and the establishment of uniform registration and licensing systems, together with the introduction of comprehensive conditions for firearm ownership, mark a significant turning point in our nation's approach to firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the end of the buyback campaign, the Commonwealth and the states and territories will evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign. The Australian Institute of Criminology will be monitoring the effect of the new firearm laws over the next three years. Work has already begun on this project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In identifying achievements, I think we can point to the removal of more than 600,000 of the more dangerous firearms from the community; the establishment of a national register with national education schemes, storage laws and rules relating to dealing; and, a subject mentioned by the member for Reid, the change of culture. You now must have a genuine reason for owning a firearm; personal protection is not an appropriate reason. If you want to own a more dangerous firearm in category C or D, you must have a genuine need for that particular firearm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the future, we can look to the 400 to 500 firearm caused deaths that have occurred in recent years in Australia reducing. The bulk of those are suicides; homicides and accidental deaths are also contributory. But the availability of firearms has been reduced, and therefore the risk to the community of death or injury from firearms will be reduced. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This self&hyphen;congratulating piece of nonsense is, of course, consistent with a government and an opposition that have got no idea of the real problems Australia has. They would rather meddle around here, mess around in these waters, without attacking the real problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to deal particularly with the speech by the member for Murray (Mrs Stone). I was in Shepparton at about the time the gun 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> buyback campaign came in. They said to me, `Oh, our member is very strong. She's the chairman of our Save the Gun Committee.' I hope the constituents of Murray read the member's speech. The speech of the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) was, of course, more predictable. His views are very much city based Labor views. It is characteristic of them that they should adopt this attitude. The member for Murray spoke with the sincere, passionately held ignorance that you would expect from Labor people in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Murray talked about the  understanding of the Prime Minister. John Howard did not understand anything. It is quite clear that John Howard did not, in the beginning, know the difference between a self&hyphen;loading and an automatic weapon. Many members of this House, to this day, do not know the difference. I believe that John Howard, desperate for a measure to elevate himself as a strong leader, grasped this on the advice of his Sydney PR people. While it has been said that this measure was popular across Australia, it is overwhelmingly much more popular in Sydney than it is elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what one would expect if one looked back in history and recalled that John Howard, our Prime Minister, is the man who set off across Australia an unjustified wave of revulsion against the French when they resumed nuclear testing when he knew, every media person knew, every member of this parliament knew, that there was not one scintilla of evidence of any risk at all to Australia or Australia's interests from French nuclear testing. It was that wave of revulsion that led to acts of violence in Perth, for which the Prime Minister ultimately must bear the responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us analyse Martin Bryant. Martin Bryant was a lunatic&mdash;a certified lunatic. Even under Tasmania's laws he was not allowed to have a gun. It is alleged there were reports six weeks before Port Arthur of Martin Bryant indiscriminately firing a gun on his property&mdash;he was reported by neighbours. No action was taken. It is also alleged that gun dealers in Hobart reported him for trying to acquire parts for a machine&hyphen;gun&mdash;probably the breech for a Bren gun. Again, no action 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8796"> was taken. I do not think there is any doubt that Martin Bryant had access to a gun handed in during a previous police amnesty in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the history of guns. Since 1915, when records began being kept in this country, the incidence of gun related violence has continually dropped; it has been graphing downwards at a consistent rate. It was not a great problem for Australia. I think that, in the last year before this ban, 71 people were killed by guns in Australia. Far more were killed in many other ways. Far more, contrary to what the member for Reid said, were killed in Australia by knives and blunt instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) put his finger on it. He said most of them were suicides; they were&mdash;and most of them were in the country. With the exception of Martin Bryant's father, I do not know of anyone who has ever shot themselves more than once when committing suicide. So clearly an automatic weapon is not necessary. The reason for most of those suicides is stress caused by economic pressure; pressure put on farmers mainly by the actions or the lack of action of governments. This House is ultimately spending half a billion dollars of taxpayers' money on this PR exercise. I suggest that, had that money been applied to an interest rate subsidy or debt reconstruction, it would probably have achieved a much greater reduction in suicides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must also look at the facts. A lot of the guns that came into this country and that were causing consternation were automatic military weapons, for which I hold no brief at all. They are not much use for sporting. They are, in fact, designed and only used for shooting people at close range&mdash;the AK47 from China being a classic case; a cheap close range weapon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These weapons were coming into Australia by the container load with the full knowledge of both the Labor Party when in government and the present government. They were distributed mainly from Queensland, with the full knowledge of the governments concerned. No attempt was made to stop them when they could have been stopped at source at the time, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as they should have been stopped. I was talking to one gun dealer in Sydney who said that one of his main sources of customers were the Vietnamese. It is very unlikely that they have handed in their AK47s. Why would they, when they know very well that the government cannot protect them from crime within their own society? A complaint that I have often had from Asian migrants is that we do nothing to protect them from crime within their own society; we would rather say that it does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of guns in the United States shows that, unlike the situation in Australia, gun related violence is rising. It occurs at about twice the rate that it does in Australia and it is rising. But again, if you take out of the calculations five United States cities&mdash;New York, Washington, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles&mdash;the actual rate of gun related violence in America is significantly lower than it is in Australia. In those five cities, it is mainly the socio&hyphen;ethnic violence which is causing this mayhem. In some of those cities, the gun laws are prohibitive. It is virtually impossible to legally own a gun. That demonstrates how little effect this measure is going to have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, it has to be understood that many people who have handed in their guns have simply used the money to go and buy another gun&mdash;a gun which can be just as lethal if used incorrectly. There was an absolutely laughable suggestion about shotguns; here again, our Prime Minister did not understand that by choking a shotgun down to a two&hyphen;shot you had basically the same as a double&hyphen;barrel, but it took much longer to load it. The experience is&mdash;as anyone who deals with guns knows&mdash;that you can discharge far more shells from a double&hyphen;barrelled shotgun than you can from a self&hyphen;loading because of the time it takes to reload the gun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is so much nonsense said in relation to this matter. What do we do? We take out of circulation the .22 self&hyphen;loading rifle, which was universally used in the bush, but you can is still have a high powered rifle. When I was commercially shooting kangaroos, I used to use a .243 calibre. To site my gun in, I used to seek to group a magazine on a cigarette 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8797"> packet at 200 metres. I defy anyone to do that with a self&hyphen;loading .22. It just cannot be done. One bullet from that .243 has many times the impact of a .22. I speak as one who has for many years carried a bullet which I collected, and I am grateful it was a .22 and not a .243.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The laws in Western Australia were already very severe, but since these new draconian laws we have seen that the police have permission to enter your house and search it if they believe that you have a gun; there is no need for a warrant. This will be abused; it has already been abused; and, of course, it is going to be abused on an ongoing basis. We have gone further than this now. If you erode people's freedom a little bit, you might as well do so a bit more. Following this legislation, the police have the power to enter your home and take you away for a 60&hyphen;day psychiatric assessment if they think you are mad. Don't say that this is not going to be abused. It is a well tried technique. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Gulag Archipelago</EMPHASIS> was all about this. This is straight out of Russia, straight out of Nazi Germany, and it is now on the statute books of our own state. I think it is an absolute disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An Aboriginal fellow said to me recently, `This is another example of one law for black and another law for white. I can tell you, they won't come out into our communities and take the guns off us.' Of course they won't. He said, `If we take them to town we will lose them, but if we keep them back in the community, no-one will take them.' If you are serious about this matter, just consider this: the biggest cause of death amongst young Aboriginal women in the Northern Territory is murder, and it is not done with guns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sick of the hyperbole, of the nonsense that is being said in relation to this issue. Australia will not be one iota safer; indeed, I believe it will be less safe. If one looks at the United States, those states which give authority to carry concealed weapons have the lowest levels of gun related violence. The French have recognised the right to self-defence in one's own home. It is now obvious that the Frenchman's home is his castle. It is a sad day that our home is no longer our castle for our people.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have already announced the government's response to the report of the fair trading inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance&mdash;Towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> . The response, entitled `New Deal: Fair Deal&mdash;Giving Small Business a Fair Go', is the most extensive program of reforms on business conduct undertaken by any government in more than two decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997, deals effectively through legislative amendment with the concerns raised in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS> about the way in which Australian businesses go about their commercial transactions. This bill deals with fair conduct in business transactions between firms, big and small, which is a critical factor contributing to the growth and prosperity of commerce in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, fair trading is one of the key elements of this government's strategy, outlined in our 1996 `New deal for small business' policy statement, to provide an economic environment that rewards business for good commercial decisions to invest, innovate and employ. Already those outcomes are being delivered, through our fiscal and monetary policies and through the fundamental program of reform of small business regulation announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS> statement in March of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although not limited in its analysis, the committee was asked to have particular reference to the position of small business retail tenants and franchisees&mdash;areas of industry where repeated calls for action against unfair conduct had been made. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS> outlined the litany of business conduct issues that had emerged during the past decade in these areas and more general commercial transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee found that small businesses were often disadvantaged in their dealings with big business. It found that much of the unfair business conduct arises from inadequate disclosure of information and the imbalance of bargaining power between parties prior to making an agreement. `New Deal: Fair Deal' deals with these concerns. It represents the strongest message ever from a federal government to small business that fairness in the commercial relationship is critical to a buoyant business environment. Small businesses now have a national government that has listened, has understood and has acted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee recommended a number of specific measures, including legislation, to induce behavioural change on the part of big business towards smaller business, and to provide to small businesses that are unfairly treated adequate means of redress. The government has accepted these conclusions and, through `New Deal: Fair Deal', is acting on each of the seven areas of reform identified by the committee, namely, unfair conduct, retail tenancy, franchising, misuse of market power, small business finance, access to justice and education.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8800">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I have introduced this legislation into the parliament today. This government is strengthening the Trade Practices Act 1974 to better protect the legal rights of small businesses, to ensure that small business can confidently deal with large firms in the knowledge that the rules under which they are operating are fair, and that there will be proper redress available when those rules are broken. By adopting these measures the government will achieve the desired outcomes without unduly impacting on the operation of the open market, compromising the basic principles of contractual relations or creating undue commercial risk, concepts which remain at the core of our free enterprise economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context, a series of information packages will be developed for small businesses. Small businesses should be aware of their rights and responsibilities leading to and in the course of contractual arrangements. The government places high importance on improving the quality of information, education and training available to small business about business conduct and fair trading issues. Notwithstanding the government's commitment to strengthened legislation and enforcement mechanisms, the adage of prevention being better than cure remains true&mdash;especially for small businesses with limited financial resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pivotal to the government's response and this bill is an acceptance that the Trade Practices Act must be made to work for small business. The government's approach will strengthen the substantive legal rights available to small business against unfair business conduct and, as well, improve enforcement of rights and access to remedies for small business. The government will achieve these objectives through legislative amendment of the Trade Practices Act in four areas:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">. a new provision that will give small business genuine access to protections against unconscionable conduct;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">. a new provision that will allow industry designed codes of practice, in full or part, to be prescribed as mandatory or voluntary codes, and enforced under the act;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">. a new provision which will allow the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, ACCC, to take representative actions against misuse of market power; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">. a new provision which will give small business interests equal importance to consumer interests when appointments are made to the ACCC. Strengthening the Trade Practices Act in the above manner will provide for open and fair competition, which is a key focus of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill implements the first two measures. The government will be consulting the states and territories on the latter two measures, as is provided for in the conduct code agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories, with a view to further legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will provide a new substantive legal remedy for small business against unconscionable conduct in the Trade Practices Act. The government has accepted the principle that small business people are entitled to a legal protection against unconscionable conduct which is comparable to that accorded to consumers. This is an approach which has been recommended by a parliamentary committee to previous governments, but not acted upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, the government will mirror for small business consumers, in a new section of the Trade Practices Act, the legal rights available to consumers in section 51AB, and incorporate a range of additional matters, set out in recommendation 6.1 of the committee's report, in order to ensure that the new provision achieves its purpose of protecting small businesses. Existing consumer protections will not be affected by the new provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business conduct which is unconscionable, having regard to the enumerated factors, will be prohibited by the act and give rise to a broad range of remedies under the act. This new provision will extend the common law doctrine of unconscionability expressed in the existing section 51AA of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill uses the expression `unconscionable conduct' in order to build on the existing body of case law which has worked well in relation to consumer protection provisions of the act and which will provide greater certain 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8801"> ty to small businesses in assessing their legal rights and remedies. As this is a new provision targeted to small business, the new provision will be limited to transactions which do not exceed $1 million. Publicly listed companies cannot instigate action under this new provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matters additional to the section 51AB considerations to which the Federal Court will be able to have regard to better assess whether conduct is unconscionable will be: the extent to which the supplier's conduct was consistent with other transactions involving similar business consumers; the requirements of a prescribed code of practice or any other code of practice with which the business consumer reasonably expected the supplier would comply; the extent of disclosure of intended conduct and unforeseen risks it may pose to the business consumer; the supplier's willingness to negotiate; and the good faith of both the parties. As with existing section 51AB, the commencement of legal proceedings in relation to a contract or transaction will not, of itself, constitute unconscionable conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure also will provide an avenue under the Trade Practices Act for some small and specialist retailers to pursue remedies where retail leasing contracts or conduct by retail landlords was unconscionable. It will be particularly beneficial to retail tenants as it allows a court to have regard to the relative strengths of the bargaining position of the retailer and the landlord in determining whether the conduct is unconscionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding this, the government would expect that the vast majority of commercial transactions would not be challenged under the new provision. The fundamental objective of the government in enacting this provision is, in the committee's words, to `induce behavioural change' where improved standards of commercial conduct are required and not a mere desire to create a more litigious commercial environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises that codes of conduct, or codes of practice, can offer flexible and efficient mechanisms to address issues of business practice. However, experience has shown that for some codes of prac 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tice legislative underpinning is necessary to ensure the effective operation of the code and to achieve the desired behavioural change in industry sectors. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will introduce into the Trade Practices Act a new part IVB which will enable the whole or a part of a code of practice to be underpinned legislatively as either a mandatory or a voluntary code after an appropriate impact assessment, consultation and approval process. This bill inserts new section 51AD into the Trade Practices Act to provide that a person bound by the act must not contravene an industry code that has been prescribed in the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A code may regulate the behaviour of industry participants towards each other or the behaviour of the participants towards consumers in the industry. The bill allows for flexibility in the type of code that can be prescribed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first types are mandatory codes. Once prescribed such codes will bind all participants in the relevant industry. The second types are voluntary codes. Once prescribed such codes will bind only those participants who agree to be bound by its provisions. It is proposed that the regulations will set out the methods by which a person may agree to be bound by a voluntary code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendment will allow mandatory codes to be prescribed only where self&hyphen;regulation has not worked or is inappropriate. A formal process of public consultation, which would include consumer and business representatives, will be required before any code may be prescribed. The requirements of the Legislative Instruments Bill and the regulation impact statement process are examples of what will be required prior to the prescribing of codes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A breach of a prescribed code may result in a range of sanctions under the Trade Practices Act, including injunctions, damages, requirements to give undertakings to the ACCC and orders to disclose information or publish corrective advertising. This measure will provide small business with dual advantages&mdash;the benefit of participation in the design of industry regulation addressing unfair conduct and meeting best practice and the security that mandated codes or provisions of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8802"> codes may be directly enforced under the Trade Practices Act itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business has been described as the `engine room' of the Australian economy. Small business accounts for over 90 per cent of all businesses in Australia and 46 per cent of the business workforce. In 1995&hyphen;96, small business accounted for 65 per cent of net new job creation. It is a vital source of enterprise, innovation and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is committed to improving the commercial environment for small business and this bill, and its related package of measures, clearly restates this government's commitment. The government has responded in a direct, positive and unambiguous manner to the committee's findings and recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislative amendments provided in this bill are key elements of a multi&hyphen;dimensional reform which, once implemented, will constitute a landmark change for all small businesses. It will improve business conduct in the Australian economy and provide a more efficient and equitable basis upon which the forces of competition can operate. Together with the government's other initiatives, it will encourage Australian businesses to deal with each other fairly and reasonably and further build on this government's framework for a sophisticated, innovative and strategic Australian industry that competes aggressively in the global market and contributes to the growth of jobs and living standards for the Australian community. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Excise Tariff Proposal No. 4 (1997) and Customs Tariff Proposal No. 8 (1997) formally placed before parliament revises the arrangements for levying excise and customs duty on tobacco products following the High Court decision on 5 August 1997 which invalidated state business franchise fees. On 7 August 1997, the Commonwealth government put in place safety net arrangements for state and territory governments by increasing excise and customs rates of duty on certain tobacco and petroleum products and sales tax on alcohol. The arrangements for petroleum products and alcohol remain unaffected by these proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the need to implement a safety net at short notice, it was necessary to use the existing Commonwealth weight based duty arrangements for tobacco. At the time the Treasurer (Mr Costello) indicated that discussions would be held to consider other arrangements that would be neutral as between different manufacturers. Following the introduction of the safety net arrangements, the states and territories held discussions with the industry and have agreed to a revised level of taxation. These new arrangements will ensure that the effect of the safety net is as close as possible to the effect of the business franchise fees which applied prior to the High Court decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new arrangements which have been requested by the states and territories are contained in these proposals. The proposals introduce a `hybrid' ad valorem and weight based regime and reduce the revenue to be collected on behalf of the states and territories. The impact on the Commonwealth budget is revenue neutral. A summary of the alterations contained in these proposals has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House.</PARA>

I should mention at the start of my speech to the House that I intend to move an amendment to the bill which, in effect, proposes that the House decline to give the bill a second reading at this stage pending consideration of a report which is being prepared at the moment by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. I shall move that amendment at the end of my contribution. My reason for proposing this is that a number of issues have come to our attention in the lead&hyphen;up to the introduction of the bill by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in the House and as a result of events that have transpired subsequently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me set the scene in broad terms for honourable members. As part of the restructuring for some years now of the wheat industry and the marketing of wheat and as part of the overall reform of agriculture was a decision of the former Labor government that growers become much more involved in the marketing of the product and become much closer to the customer so that they could be more responsive to market trends and more involved and more informed about the various issues involved, including the financial arrangements in underwriting $2 billion worth of the wheat stockpile and the marketing of that both on the domestic and international markets. Prior to that, the operation was conducted by the Australian Wheat Board and underwritten by a government guarantee where growers grew their wheat and the Wheat Board guaranteed to buy it and it then became the responsibility of the Wheat Board and the government to sell it. Like many other areas in the Australian economy, this has been changing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In arrangements negotiated by former ministers Kerin, Simon Crean and Bob Collins, the former government set up the process which has led to the model that has now been presented in this House by the minister. I make the point very clearly that the process and the structure were models envisaged by the former government. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> detail of implementation was taken over by this government after its election in March 1996, but a few things have started to go awry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That culminated in the Senate taking a decision three weeks ago for the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee to conduct hearings into the bill with a closing date of 23 October, as it now is. It was going to be 2 October. There was sufficient discontent on the part of a number of growers and participants in the wheat industry for the Senate&mdash;and not just the opposition in the Senate but also the government members in the Senate&mdash;to approve the standing committee having a look at the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill and bringing down a prompt report dealing with a number of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, I thought that the government had decided to postpone consideration of this bill in the House pending the report back from that committee. It conducted its first hearing in Canberra last week. It is only conducting two hearings. It is a rapid inquiry. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), one of the better informed members of the government in relation to the wheat industry, made representations to that committee. I had assumed that the government was postponing consideration of this bill in this House while that committee went about its task and reported back so that we could all have the benefits of its consideration before this debate was brought on, which has happened tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now in the rather ludicrous position where we have the Senate legislation committee conducting hearings, bringing the players in, listening to their concerns and reservations and telling us that it is going to bring down a report on 23 October, which is only a bit over three weeks away from now, and all of a sudden the government deciding that it must bring this bill on now and pass it through the House of Representatives quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see the reason for that. I will voice a number of the issues that are under consideration by the Senate committee and make a plea to the minister that he reconsider taking the formal vote on this bill at the moment. If we are to take a formal vote, then 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8804"> I will move my amendment that we not give the bill a second reading at this stage but in effect defer it until we have the opportunity to consider the Senate committee's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the restructuring of the wheat industry, in particular the Australian Wheat Board, there were always issues involved in moving the government guarantee out of underwriting the funding of the cost of the Australian wheat pool. There were also issues about who would actually be on the new body which would actually oversee what we call the single desk. One of the things that has been adopted by the government and continued to be supported by the opposition, myself included, is the notion of the single desk&mdash;that is, collecting all of Australia's export wheat together and marketing it through a single marketing authority that operates on the international market on behalf of Australian wheat growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Formerly that Wheat Board was a body consisting of people appointed by the minister. Now it is being transformed into a grower owned company. Within that structure, or underneath it, we formed a body&mdash;I guess you would call it that&mdash;called the wheat industry fund, which has been funded since 1989 by grower levies. It now has something in the vicinity of $440 million in it. That is growers' funds that they have been compulsorily depositing in it with the view in mind, first of all, that it would provide some financial support at the time that the domestic market was deregulated and it became open selling within the Australian domestic market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It went past that phase and has now become the capital base that will underwrite the capital structure of the privately owned company that will take over from the Australian Wheat Board. It will have substantial equity in the vicinity of $550 million, which means that the grower owned body will have its own capital that growers have been saving towards, if you could use that term, since 1989. That was the structure that was envisaged by us and it is all falling into place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be some questions now about whether a company, in the normal corporate sense of the word, is the best structure. That 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is something that I hope the Senate committee is having a look at because one of the issues that has been raised is that it is intended at the end of this process for growers to be able to make a decision to leave their funds in the company as B&hyphen;class shares&mdash;in other words, their wheat industry fund capital base will stay there. But they may make a decision at the point at which they fully control it themselves to list it as a public company, which means institutional investors will then be able to buy shares and they may in fact buy out the shares of growers, if they want to sell them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of issues that then arise out of that structure. If, for instance, institutional investors become shareholders of the future grower owned company, the shareholders, by law, have a very direct responsibility and the directors have a very direct responsibility. That responsibility is to maximise the return to the shareholders.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if that same company has a second objective, and that is to maximise the return to the grower, you may well have a quite direct conflict of interest because the only way you can maximise the return to the shareholder is by squeezing the returns to the grower, thus increasing the profit of the company and therefore the dividend to the shareholders. While the grower and the shareholder are the same person, that does not matter very much but, if it seeks to list on the stock exchange, if it opens itself up to being a corporate body in that sense, these are issues that have to be resolved and have to be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the issues that also has to be determined by the government is that, during this period of growth of the wheat industry fund, the capital value of the shares of the growers that are held in it at the moment have actually improved quite substantially. When they finally come to be listed as publicly traded shares, or as internally traded shares, whether it is just growers selling to other growers and the sale of those shares is drawn back in, are they subject to capital gains tax? Having been required contributions by the government to underwrite the equity of the pool, when the grower actually gets his or her money back and has made a capital gain on them, are we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8805"> now going to say that they have to pay capital gains tax on those shares? That is one of the issues that is yet to be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So a number of people are putting to the government and to the Senate committee that they have quite serious concerns about the process that is being undertaken by the minister. The minister has brought in what we call the first tranche of the whole package. He has brought in the  Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997 , which sets up the transition stages from the Wheat Board through to the new grower owned company, but the bill does not provide any of those answers on those issues that will really have to be answered and resolved during the next 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many people saying now, `Hang on, you're expecting us to buy a pig in a poke. Why would you bring in half the show now? Why do you have to rush through half the legislation now? Why are we being forced to accept this model without our having a real picture of what might be the second half of the model?' So those concerns are now being quite strongly voiced&mdash;particularly by Western Australian grain growers, who are responsible for a substantial part of Australia's export wheat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not very often that I find myself here in the House quoting from the comments of the member for O'Connor. There are not all that many things in policy terms that he and I have in common, but I did see something like that in his evidence to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on 15 September. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first question to arise is whether the Wheat Board is ever going to be the same operation. Why are we rushing into this particular legislation, years before the full privatisation is proposed when the Wheat Board can continue to operate in its present form, while all the outstanding issues are resolved?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So a significant player in this issue on the government side is asking the same question I am&mdash;that is, why are we rushing into this? He also raised the question of the conflict of interest of shareholders. I quote again his words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . you get elected with a responsibility to the people who then own the shares&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">assuming that an outside institution or private investor has become a shareholder in this company; if that happens:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the law provides you must look after the shareholder. That means you maximise the profits of the Australian Wheat Board. To some extent, you can do it by your skill in marketing, but primarily you will do it by reducing returns to wheat growers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the member for O'Connor made exactly the same point that I am making now. This potential conflict of interest comes through the structure the minister is proposing and because he is presenting the first tranche of the legislation without giving us a look at the finer details of the next stages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue that concern is being expressed about&mdash;that is, the future holdings of growers in the wheat industry fund. This model is requiring that the $500 million not be accessible to growers at this point, and it will not be accessible for another two years. The member for O'Connor has again made the very valid point that, with a number of growers on the east coast of Australia facing long-term climate changes, they need to be able to access some capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point, the money in that fund is government guaranteed and can be used, for instance, as security if a farmer goes to a bank or someone else to borrow against  future crops. Many farmers would actually like to be able to withdraw their equity in the fund, and on average that amounts to up to $200,000. They would like to be able to draw on those funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we established this model back in the late 1980s&mdash;and I have had some discussions with some of the farmer organisations about this&mdash;interest rates in Australia were much higher than they are now. We had not put into the economic structure of the nation the long-term patient capital base that is now there in the form of $400 billion worth of superannuation funds. Now you find in Australia that there is quite a different investment climate and quite a different pool of capital available. It may be that growers ought to be able to exercise some choice about withdrawing their funds from the WIF because, with interest rates having declined to the levels that they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8806"> are now, it may no longer be necessary to have this degree of grower owned equity in the company or this degree of leveraging that we felt back in 1989 would be desired in the model.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not giving a definitive answer on this. What I am saying is that things have changed. There are calls by some growers who want access to their funds now because what they invested in was a government guaranteed and controlled fund with no risk. They always knew they would get their money back dollar for dollar, full value. Now their fund is being transformed into a free enterprise risk structure and, while I would say at this point it is quite unlikely that there would be any diminution in their capital value, the fact is that this legislation does provide that the new holding company can have access to funds from the WIF to do some of its tasks during the next two years. If the new holding company performs badly, it is possible that it could run down the capital value of that equity in the wheat industry fund. It is also true that, with government underwriting being withdrawn, the wheat industry fund, the Wheat Board and the holding company do not have the same access to three-star, AAA rated, government backed funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is a commercial risk. Of course there is. We are transforming this whole thing into a grower owned, private sector operation with a government sanctioned export single desk, but that carries with it the normal commercial risk. Some of those growers are saying, `Hang on. I didn't put my money in for it to be that. I put it into a government guaranteed and operated monopoly. I would like to take my money out now.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am personally quite relaxed about that. I believe there is a case to say that we ought to be rethinking this restriction on their access to the funds because I do not think the circumstances warrant that it be locked up in that form any longer. A number of issues on the table before the Senate committee really require a little bit of extra consideration before we make a final decision on this bill in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry participants and the growers have already faced some disappointments. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They traipsed to Canberra for the committee hearing the other day. It has been reported to me that they were very disappointed in the interest shown by one of the government members of the committee, Senator McGauran&mdash;not the former minister for science, but his brother. They tell me that during the whole hearing he read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I suppose he was reading about his brother&mdash;taking no interest whatsoever in any of the submissions to the committee and then he wandered out. For a National Party senator who purports to have an interest in rural and regional matters, he did not make a very flash impression on his country constituents who were making presentations before that committee. I will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that his mind was on family matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is where we are at. The minister has for some reason brought this bill on quickly now, knowing that, in the Senate, the government members supported the formation of a committee to look at the bill and, under the direction of the chairman, Senator Crane, to make rapid progress in bringing down the report by 23 October. That being the case, I would have thought that the most sensible thing for this House to do would be to wait to hear what suggestions the committee has to make on what changes we ought make to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A little earlier, I touched upon the question of tax treatment of capital gains and other elements. I wish to reassure you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and those opposite that this is not just the opposition making mischief or trying to find some way to delay this just for the sake of it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">They have asked the Senate committee to specifically note their concerns and produce some answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to the point that I mentioned earlier concerning conflict of interest, which Mr Moffet also touched on strongly in his presentation: the fact that once you become a shareholder with a responsibility to shareholders, if they are institutional investors, their returns can only be gained through the diminution of the returns to growers or at the expense of growers. These issues are real. They are being raised by key players in the industry. I think the House ought to be taking account of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, I want to make it very clear that, from the Labor side of the House, we totally support the general thrust of what is happening here in the restructuring of the Australian wheat industry&mdash;the transition from a complete public sector owned and operated monopoly with a single desk to a grower owned structure where Australian wheat growers are responsible for their own destiny in that sense&mdash;in fact, we started it, and we took it most of the way down the process. It got handed over to the government with the election in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The structure that the government has now put in place, particularly the A&hyphen;class and B&hyphen;class share structures, has taken a lot of resolving. Quite a lot of conflict is going on at the moment among the grower organisations&mdash;particularly the Western Australian grain growers and the Grain Industry Task Force&mdash;about who is who and how the domestic and international share of the market will be divided between various growers, and these other issues that I have raised now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) would have been listening to those grower concerns. Having presumably approved the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government members in the Senate cooperating with and chairing the committee that is analysing all this, I would have thought that he would have had the political sense and the political decency to postpone consideration of this bill in this House pending the handing down of the report by the Senate committee on 23 October.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R309">Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill</XREF>  is a belated response by the government to the private member's bill with respect to a cap on aircraft movements at Sydney airport that was introduced the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) some time ago. I think it is fair to say that, without that action by the honourable member for Grayndler, this legislation on the part of the government would never have appeared before this House. But we should not be too churlish about it. Better late than never, I suppose, is a fair way of assessing the legislation that we have before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation establishes a cap of 80 movements per hour on the operations of Kingsford Smith airport, subject to certain exemptions relating to matters such as military needs, emergencies and the like, none of which the opposition has any complaint about; it provides for Airservices Australia to monitor the compliance with the cap and also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> establishes a slot system to ensure that there is a more diffuse distribution of aircraft movements than currently applies at the moment; it provides for fines of up to $220,000 for infringements of the cap and slot arrangements; it establishes a framework for allocation of slots but provides that the detail for that process will be in regulatory arrangements that presumably will be put before the parliament in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is based on an IATA model, although there are some variations which are worth noting at least. Firstly, I am pleased to say that there is protection for the interests of regional airlines, which is critical to the economic and social existence of many parts of rural and regional New South Wales, and which ensures that the slots available for regionals cannot be interfered with or diminished. Secondly, 50 per cent of the unallocated slots will be available for new entrants, which thereby ensures that there is an encouragement to greater competition in aviation services, which I am supportive of. Thirdly, there is a strict compliance regime, as I indicated, with fines and compliance&mdash;courtesy of Airservices Australia&mdash;which also are clearly necessary in order to make sure that this regime works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a slot manager and a compliance committee appointed by the minister to ensure that the system functions properly. Fines will potentially be triggered if planes are outside the 15&hyphen;minute bandwidth of their designated time period, although there will be certain circumstances in which that will not apply. The cost of the administration will be borne 90 per cent by airlines and 10 per cent by the airport currently owned by the FAC, of course, but eventually it will be owned by a private owner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that, if there is an average of 70 per cent yield level on movements, the additional costs for major airlines will be in the vicinity of half a cent per passenger per journey&mdash;in other words, negligible&mdash;and for smaller airlines somewhere in the vicinity of 15c per head per journey&mdash;again, pretty limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition supports the legislation with one minor caveat, that is, we have had it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8809"> available to us for only a few days. As you would appreciate, we have had one or two distracting issues in the last few days relating to the late, unlamented former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), which have made it a little difficult to give intense scrutiny to legislation in the intervening period. Nonetheless, we have scrutinised it but we do reserve the right to consider pursuing some amendments in the Senate, if further scrutiny reveals the need to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I point out that the Labor Party very strongly supports the notion of a cap at Sydney airport and also the current curfew arrangements. It is critical that relief is provided to people living in the immediate vicinity of Sydney airport. I ask honourable members who are a bit cynical about Sydney airport issues&mdash;and there are some&mdash;to go and visit places like Sydenham, to stand there, to visit people in their houses, as I have done, to actually experience what it is like to live immediately under that flight path with the ever increasing level of aviation traffic. It is an extraordinary experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The suffering that many people have to go through because of the massive increase in the use of Kingsford Smith airport is not going to change. The projections tabled by the minister in recent times&mdash;the projections associated with the EIS into the proposed Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy alternatives for a second Sydney airport&mdash;indicate that there will be a steadily mounting level of aviation traffic for Sydney. Commonsense suggests that that is precisely what is going to occur. If that continues to occur at Kingsford Smith airport, life for many people, which is already very difficult, will just simply become unbearable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sobering experience to visit places like Sydenham, to see the businesses in the shopping centre that have effectively been wiped out. Most of them have closed as a result of the substantial purchase of large numbers of homes in that area where life literally became unlivable because of the third runway and the increase in traffic that that entailed. It is a sobering experience.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to note on the last visit that I made to the area that there is a degree of backsliding by the government with respect to insulation matters. For example, one place that I visited was the Stanmore Baptist Church. It was originally promised insulation and has been engaged in something of a tug of war with the minister since that period, trying to get proper insulation for what is a desperately needed requirement, that is, to be able to do basic things like conduct church services, weddings and funerals without having to interrupt them every two or three minutes as a plane flies over. That is literally what has to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can you imagine what it is like on your big day&mdash;your wedding day or the day when you are farewelling a loved one at a funeral&mdash;when the service has to be interrupted every few minutes because the noise of an overflying plane is so severe that it is impossible for anybody in there to be heard? That is what people have to put up with in that church.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a ludicrous response from the government that they will insulate one church building. Apparently, according to the government, all churches are the same: they have one major building where people worship and any other buildings associated with it really are nothing to do with worship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this instance, there are two major buildings, both of which are used for worship purposes, both of which do need insulation. There is also a third building which probably should have it as well. But it would appear that, in the government's view, only one is qualified for insulation. They should stand firm with respect to the commitment that was made previously to insulate both buildings at the very least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter, where the government does not deserve any blame, is the diabolical consequences that have been suffered by the businesses in Sydenham. It is an issue that has gradually unfolded&mdash;I referred to it a moment ago&mdash;and has really hit a peak in the term of office of this current government, although it did emerge in the latter period of the former Labor government. Something like 13 businesses&mdash;ordinary businesses like milk bars and newsagents, hardware stores and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8810"> things like that&mdash;have closed down. There are people there who have lost an enormous amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the anomaly where people living above their businesses are deemed not to be in residential accommodation and therefore do not qualify for insulation or purchase, even though the location would otherwise qualify them. So there are one or two people in that situation in the businesses as well. Their situation is an appalling one. I urge the government and the new minister to look very carefully at trying to do something to assist those businesses. Through no fault of their own, their economic hinterland has been laid waste. The local base from which they drew their custom has been destroyed, and most of them have closed down. It is a tragic situation and one that really does deserve some assistance from government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth commenting on the situation with respect to Sydney airport more generally. As far as the opposition is concerned, the new long&hyphen;term flight plan that has been introduced by the government is totally unfair. It is designed primarily to relieve the burden on the electorate of Bennelong, the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), which, prior to the last election, he was a bit nervous about losing. In the past we had what was referred to as the Bennelong funnel. We now have, courtesy of the new arrangements, the Bennelong triangle&mdash;the place where the aeroplanes disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you actually look at the maps, when you see the flight paths that are now proposed or are now operating, you will see that they head off in a triangular sort of pattern: north of the airport there is a gap that opens up and it just happens to consist of the electorate of Bennelong&mdash;the electorate of the Prime Minister. That is the primary objective of the Sydney airport long&hyphen;term operating plan&mdash;to relieve the pressure on the electorate of Bennelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a variety of features of this plan which I think are worth referring to. The first is the use of the concept of aircraft movements as a basis for determining the distribution of noise. That sounds, superficially, a reasonable proposition, but it is not, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because not all movements are the same. Take&hyphen;offs are quite different from landings because take&hyphen;offs involve more noise; but take&hyphen;offs are more flexible in where they can head, once you get a few kilometres away from the airport, than are landings which, by definition, have to come in both low and straight. Secondly, in terms of impact, there is a difference between the movements of major jumbo jets&mdash;for example, 737s, 767s and so on&mdash;and small commuter aircraft. Yet these are all defined as movements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is by no means an accident that this is occurring. The proportion of take-offs&mdash;the most noisy, intrusive form of movement&mdash;by major planes over water, over Botany Bay to the south, has been significantly reduced. Again it is not an accident. It has been reduced. The number of landings from the south has been increased. The reason is that, when you have take-offs to the north, it is easier to avoid the electorate of Bennelong because they can, and they do, head off to the left and to the right. But they cannot do that with the landings. So it is all about protecting the Prime Minister's electorate, the electorate of Bennelong. That is exactly what is occurring. It is very blatant when you actually look at the detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that this also involves significant breaches of election promises. There was a promise that there would be no northern take-offs from the third runway. Do we remember that promise? That promise has been abandoned. Also, there was the promise that there would be no additional aircraft noise for Lowe. That promise has been abandoned. Guess where the planes are heading? The inner north-west is copping a beating as a result of the new arrangements, and the eastern suburbs around Coogee and Randwick are copping a beating because the northern take-offs from the third runway are doing a hard right 30&hyphen;degree banking turn to head in an easterly direction in order to ensure that the Prime Minister's electorate does not cop the brunt. I might add that that includes the rest of the North Shore, which is represented by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), at the same time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8811">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is this unfair but it also raises significant safety questions. The experts will tell you that it is perfectly safe to do the hard banking right-hand turn, but it does raise a question in your mind along these lines: if there is an emergency at that particular point, isn't there a risk that the chance of avoiding disaster is less than if the plane is level? A significant question that this government has to address is whether or not there is a diminution in safety&mdash;it may be only slight&mdash;as a result of the insistence on the hard banking right-hand turns on take-offs from the third runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ironic that the former minister, Mr Sharp, who introduced the long-term operating plan, became a victim of it in May. He discovered that one of the consequences of the long-term operating plan is that it causes planes to bank up in a queue. Planes have to circle in the sky for quite some time, waiting in a queue. On 17 May this year he was in a small plane waiting to land, and he got a bit frustrated. So he rang them up on his mobile phone. The pilot did not contact the control tower. It was not the pilot. No, it was the minister, the passenger, who rang the control tower. He did not ring them via the radio&mdash;the normal open line which other pilots can hear. Why? Because he knew other pilots could hear. He rang on the 1800 number&mdash;the private line. That private line is there for another purpose, which is for pilots to ring in to lodge flight plans before they leave the ground.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is your best defence that this is old? It is only a few months old. Three times he said, `Can't you do better than that?' He is the victim of his own arrangements. It was a blatant attempt to misuse his ministerial authority to get preferential treatment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all seen in the past few days how the attitude of the honourable member for Hume, the former Minister for Transport and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Regional Development, to the performance of his duties and to questions of accountability and public responsibility has brought him undone. This was just one step in that process. This was one indicator of his attitude, his arrogance, his willingness to defy the rules and constraints and proper forms of behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a lesson for people in Sydney to see the real attitude of this minister that he was prepared to send planes over places that had not had them before and had been promised that they would not get them. He was prepared to get into all sorts of convoluted arrangements in order to ensure that the Prime Minister is totally safe in his electorate and that people in Bennelong do not have to worry about such mundane matters as planes flying overhead. He was prepared to do that but, as soon as these arrangements impacted on him, straightaway he was prepared to use his ministerial authority to try to get preferential treatment for himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worthy to note in the context of this debate that this government&mdash;committed, supposedly, to the notion of a second airport for Sydney at Badgerys Creek&mdash;decided after the election, having said nothing about that before the election, that it was going to consider Holsworthy as an alternative site. There is a whole range of possible reasons why this was added. Of course, the electors of Hughes and other surrounding electorates were not informed of this prior to the election. According to the government, that is a minor detail, but they were not informed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in spite of the fact that under Labor an EIS process found that Holsworthy was a crazy place to put an airport, this government decided that it would do an EIS again. Five million dollars later, it worked out the same answer. John Sharp found that Holsworthy is a crazy place to put an airport&mdash;with massive amounts of taxpayers' money down the drain, thousands of lives in and around the Holsworthy area seriously disrupted and, incidentally, further significant delay in the provision of a second airport for Sydney. In total, you have a Sydney airport policy disaster on the part of this government, which has talked long and hard and made promises which it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8812"> has broken all the way along and, in addition, has done things by deceit, which it did not disclose at the previous election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note the government members on the speakers list for this evening. First we have the member for North Sydney, the beneficiary; then we have the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit), the victim; then we have the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), the man who does not quite know what he is; and, finally, we have the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), the new minister for transport who will have to clean up the mess. That is a superb line&hyphen;up to come in and tell us all why John Sharp did a great job, why the performance that he put in on this issue should be sustained and why the long-term operating plan&mdash;and I will be interested to hear what the member for Lowe has to say about it&mdash;is a great thing for Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support this legislation. It is long overdue. The Albanese bill should have been allowed to be implemented and be passed through this parliament when it was first introduced rather than sitting around for months, as the government has allowed it to do. We will wait for the detail with respect to regulations and consider the regulatory structures on their merits in order to determine whether or not the implementation of the legislation through the regulations is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will continue to oppose the unfair, mendacious approach that this government has taken with respect to operational arrangements and flight paths at Sydney airport, which are all designed to benefit people living on the North Shore and the people living in the electorate of Bennelong at the expense of a variety of people living in Sydney who were promised before the election, `Don't worry. We'll look after you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997  is a good bill, but the attitudes of the government to Sydney airport, its functions and its operations are very definitely not. This government stands condemned for the approach it has taken and for the biased and grossly unfair approach it continues to take with Sydney airport matters.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I relish the opportunity to follow the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R309">Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997</XREF> . It is a very important bill because it delivers to the dotted `i' and the crossed `t' the policy of the Liberal Party prior to the last election which was entitled `Putting people first'. That is exactly what we are doing; we are putting people first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1.5 million people in the Sydney basin whose lives are affected by aircraft noise are better off as we progress through the delivery of the policy that we promised prior to the last election. That policy had a number of components. The first component was to reopen the east-west runway&mdash;the one the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) closed some time ago in order to punish the people of Marrickville, Sydenham, Leichhardt, Drummoyne&mdash;and I note the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) is here; he is always representing very vigorously the views of his electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith sought to punish the people of Lane Cove, who are in my electorate, and the people of Hunters Hill and Gladesville, who are in the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and also a number of people in the electorates of the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and the member for Sydney (Mr Bob Baldwin). The member for Sydney has been particularly quiet on this issue, which perhaps is not surprising given that he is quiet on every other issue as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are doing is delivering on the second component, which is to introduce a cap of 80 movements an hour on the airport. We already introduced the cap in policy terms. What we are doing now is delivering the legislation that we promised prior to the last election. And we are delivering lock, stock and barrel. It is more than what people bargained for because we are delivering a slot system, which Mr Albanese's bill did not have in it, which is going to ensure that the cap of 80 movements per hour is feasible. Secondly, we are ensuring that a certain number of slots are reserved for regional airlines. Thirdly, we are ensuring that, basi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8813"> cally, 50 per cent of slots are available for new entrants. I notice that the member for Melbourne congratulated us on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area which is a very important part of the bill is the discretion left for the minister for transport to reduce the number of movements per hour through regulation if he so chooses. That is a very important component because it ensures the long-term viability of the long-term operating plan for the Kingsford Smith airport. That is a plan that has gone through enormous community consultation over the last few months. It involved significant consultation involving a bipartisan committee which I chair&mdash;the Sydney Airport Community Forum. The member for Barton (Mr McClelland) and the member for Lowe are both members of that forum and have made a very active and important contribution to the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a third and vital part of our policy which is yet to be implemented. That is the commitment to a second international airport for Sydney. I had become aware over the last few months, particularly the last few days, of the gross hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party on this issue. It is now becoming an open sore for the Labor Party, particularly given that this weekend they have got the New South Wales state conference where there will be a motion put forward about whether there is going to be an endorsement of the federal policy of the Labor Party to support Badgerys Creek as the option for the second international airport for Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alan Ramsay wrote a very revealing article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> some weeks ago. Rather than go through the very well&hyphen;researched and detailed article, I think it is important to get on the record some very important dates referred to by Mr Ramsay. The Australian Labor Party's hands are all over Badgerys Creek and we will find out, in quite a revealing series of quotations, exactly how the ALP proposes to debate this issue both publicly and for the people of western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Alan Ramsay suggested, on 17 February 1986 Bob Hawke announces: `Badgerys Creek has been selected as the site for the second Sydney airport.' On 11 March 1986, Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Arthur Gietzelt said in the Senate: `The Hawke government has bitten the bullet.' On 9 May 1990, Bob Collins refers to the construction of Badgerys Creek. On 18 April 1991, John Faulkner, the now Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, in a question to Bob Collins, who was the Minister for Transport and Communications, asks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it still anticipated that the first runway and associated services will be available at Badgerys Creek in 1992, in accordance with the 1990/91 Federal Budget?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To which Senator Bob Collins replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No. Preliminary design work on the proposed new airport indicates [it] would take some 27 months to complete from the time a decision is made . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 10 December 1991, Senator Bob Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to announce the Government will spend $58 million over two years on a general aviation facility at Badgerys Creek . . . to handle small to medium-sized jets by 1994.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 29 April he again reconfirms the commitment to Badgerys Creek. On 26 June 1992, Bob Collins unveils a sign at Badgerys Creek and announces that more than $100 million has been spent on site acquisition for Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here they come&mdash;the big hitters. On 21 August 1993, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), noticeably absent from this debate, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Councillor Latham said Australia needed an international airport which could operate 24 hours a day without noise curfews if it wanted to enmesh itself with Asia, and only Badgerys Creek could provide that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 9 September, there was a press release by Senator Bob Collins, the former transport minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Bob Collins, today reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the staged development of Badgerys Creek as Sydney's second major airport.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In December 1993, Bob Collins turns the first sod at Badgerys Creek&mdash;there has not been a second sod. It gets better. On 15 December 1993, Liverpool City Mayor Mark Latham said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With signs of an economic recovery underway, this is an outstanding chance to capture private sector 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8814"> investment for the airport and provide a huge employment boost to Sydney's West and South West.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor MPs in West and East Sydney, most of whom are strong supporters of an international airport at Badgerys Creek, will now have a feasible plan to promote within the Caucus and Cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was a press release presenting the joint Liverpool&hyphen;Penrith Council action plan for Badgerys Creek airport to the federal government. We will come back to Penrith Council in a moment. It goes on and on. On 24 January 1994, there was Laurie Brereton's commitment. Listen to this: on 21 April 1994, the member for Chifley (Mr Price)&mdash;I am going to come back to the member for Chifley&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An international airport in this area would create countless opportunities for the areas people and businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone agrees on its benefits. Why is it then that we only seem to be engaged in discussions&mdash;why aren't we seeing some action.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what the member for Chifley said. The member for Chifley was up in this House the other day complaining about the government's commitment to Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are further comments. We have got the ALP on this. We have got you on this. We know what you are up to. There is a whole lot more here: 4 May 1994 from Laurie Brereton; 5 May 1994 from Roger Price; 8 May 1994 from Laurie Brereton; 26 November 1994 from Bob Carr; 29 November 1994 from departmental advisers; 6 December 1994, Warwick Parer in a question to Collins; and so on. The list is continuous. The turning point really came on 21 May 1996. Lindsay Tanner, in a question to John Sharp, asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can the minister guarantee that his decision, announced today, to consider Holsworthy as an alternative site will not substantially delay construction of Sydney West airport?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was the previous speaker in this House tonight, the member for Melbourne, who was pushing forward the issue. We said that we were going to look at the alternatives, and that is why Holsworthy came in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our election commitment `Putting people first'&mdash;which we have done&mdash;we gave an unequivocal commitment to the people of western Sydney that we would have another 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> EIS. That was never the intention of the Australian Labor Party. When they saw our policy they said, `Oh, we should really have a second EIS on it as well.' Our delivery of a second EIS on Badgerys Creek is exactly what the Labor Party promised at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could live with the comments of the federal Labor Party, but I cannot live with the comments of the state Labor Party. The state Labor Party is a party that basks itself in hypocrisy and unctuousness of distraught people who happen to feel the political pain of holding marginal seats at Badgerys Creek, Penrith and in the Blue Mountains. Do you know what? After all the comments of the past, the New South Wales Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning, Craig Knowles&mdash;my colleagues will be very interested in this&mdash;in a press release on 3 September this year said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The New South Wales Government cannot support the three options for Badgerys Creek which will form the basis of the new EIS.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Note that the first option, option A, is the same option that the Labor Party took to the last election. Craig Knowles is now saying, `Hey, ho, we can't support option A.' He said that on 3 September 1997. We will come back to that&mdash;I am having fun here. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people around Badgerys Creek will have the full support of the New South Wales Government in their fight against John Sharp's airport proposals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In an interview with Clive Robertson on 4 September 1997, Mr Knowles said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it's fair to say an outside of Sydney Basin airport would be marginal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, Mr Knowles, which way are you flip&hyphen;flopping today? On the one hand you are saying, `Well, we really don't want Badgerys Creek but, on the other hand, we recognise that an airport outside the city basin won't work. But, on the other hand, the secret agenda of the federal government is to extend Kingsford Smith airport. But, on the other hand, we don't want a second airport in the Sydney basin. But, on the other hand'&mdash;he is an octopus by this stage&mdash;`really we don't think an airport outside the Sydney basin will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8815"> work.' Where do we go? Mr Knowles went one step further. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People are absolutely fed up with the procrastination of successive governments over the selection of an airport.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said that to Phillip Clark on 2BL on 5 September 1997. We are watching you, Craig Knowles. We are watching you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all his statements, here come the beauties. Premier Bob Carr, the great flip&hyphen;flop man: remember the great promises of the last state election that the waiting lists would come down in hospitals and that they would lift the tollways and the various penalties the people of western and southern Sydney are charged? Listen to this&mdash;this is Premier Bob Carr's form on this issue. On 11 November 1993, Bob Carr described Badgerys Creek as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . one of the most exciting opportunities for business and employment in NSW.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's a desperate need for the 36,000 new jobs and the boost to economic activity that Badgerys Creek represents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Private sector involvement in building and owning an airport is going to make it happen sooner rather than later. Let's go for that. Let's go for the jobs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was Bob Carr on 11 November 1993. On 28 November 1994, Bob Carr said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State Labor has a strategy to build Badgerys Creek airport by the end of 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In a press release on 13 April 1995, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My plan to bring forward completion of the Sydney west airport honours another Labor election commitment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  of 14 April 1995 states:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">But wait, we have more. On 3 July 1995 in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> , Bob Carr is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You've got to look at long-term solutions here and the only long-term solution is to get a second international airport for Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 10 May, 1995, Bob Carr is quoted as saying: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fast&hyphen;tracking Sydney West Airport will create thousands of new construction and service industry jobs in Sydney's west.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on and on. I have quotes here from 11 May 1995, 23 September 1995, 21 May 1996 and 28 November 1996. That last date is of particular importance, because 28 November 1996 was nearly 20 days after we announced all the options for Badgerys Creek. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS>  of 28 November 1996 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only yesterday Mr Carr reaffirmed the State Government's position in support of Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So he knew the options. He had had 20 days to consider the options, and he reaffirms his commitment to Badgerys Creek. This is a weaseling Bob Carr. On 4 September 1997 he makes another commitment to Badgerys Creek on the Clive Robertson show on 2GB. Bob Carr has got form on this, but it goes further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A report was commissioned by Michael Knight, the New South Wales Minister for Public Works and Services in 1995. The Standing Committee on Public Works looked into the state infrastructure requirements for Sydney West airport. The chairman of that committee was Mr Paul Crittenden, and committee members included Mrs Dianne Beamer, the member for Badgerys Creek; Ms Sandra Nori, member for Port Jackson from the ALP; John Price, the member for Waratah; Tony Stewart, the member for Lakemba; and Gerry Sullivan, the member for Wollongong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee recommended that Sydney West airport should be Sydney's second major airport; that it should be curfew free and capable of handling major domestic and international jet traffic. The committee recommended that the master plan should include parallel runways of 4,000 metres and 2,500 metres and room for future generations of aircraft with 95 metre wing spans. Listen to this! They reaffirm the commitment to an airport with an ultimate annual capacity of 275,000 aircraft movements and 13 million passengers. It gets better, because the state member for Badgerys Creek, a member of the committee endorsing this Sydney West report, said in state parliament:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8816">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was gratifying that upon coming to government we had to come to grips with the need for an airport at Badgerys Creek. We had to plan for the airport which will be located in the centre of my electorate. I was happy to be involved in such a good task.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the Penrith press on 28 September 1993, Mrs Beamer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we will have to seriously push for the second airport at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It gets better. On 9 November 1993, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Penrith Star</EMPHASIS>  illustrates a gross hypocrisy. I will save it for another day. The hypocrisy is also reflected by the member for Chifley. I am running out of time, but I can say that on 16 September 1997 we know what Roger Price said to the Penrith edition of the Fairfax <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun</EMPHASIS> . We also know what he said in the Penrith press. The member for Penrith in the state parliament, Faye Lo Po&mdash;this is a great quote&mdash;said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is not a lot that the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) has said with which I disagree.

The position of the Australian Labor Party is to support the construction of a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. As the actress said to the bishop, `Just do it.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1995 budget, Mr Brereton, the Labor Minister for Transport, had allocated a total of $762 million to the government's commitment to the airport's development at Badgerys Creek, including associated infrastructure. The funding was not delivered because of the then Liberal opposition opposing the leasing of Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport which was to provide the funding for that project. If there is any doubt that the present government is aware that money had been allocated, on 2 June 1996 in response to a question by Glenn Milne in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Face to Face</EMPHASIS> interview, the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, said that the $600 million would have to be delayed `until such time as we know that we can proceed with Badgerys Creek'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact there is not one thing holding the government back; the opposition supports a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. Under Labor's plan it was going to be up and running by the year 2000. It would have been had the present government, when in opposition, not destroyed the funding base in about September 1995. The prevarication that this government has undertaken, including in particular that farcical EIS proposal for Holsworthy, has been nothing but a procrastination and a delaying tactic. One wonders whether the government has, as their current policy, that which was stated to be the case on 30 May 1988, where they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the emphasis on upgrading Kingsford&hyphen;Smith Airport, approval for the construction of a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek will not be granted until all the possible improvements to the capacity and safety at Kingsford&hyphen;Smith have been made and the need for an additional airport clearly defined.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are carrying on with a few mirrors and a bit of smoke in the background here, but 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8817"> one wonders whether they have a genuine commitment to Badgerys Creek. The facts of the matter are that it is not a state issue; it is a federal issue, so just get on with the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addressing the bill before us, I wish to note that the opposition supports the cap of 80 movements an hour. Indeed, we say it is substantially catch&hyphen;up politics consequent upon the private member's bill introduced by the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) on 4 May 1996. Be that as it may, it would be ungracious not to accept that this cap is a good thing. But the reality is that it is operating in a flawed, inefficient and unsafe system with the crossing runway configuration in such an extremely busy airport. I want to focus on those three issues: efficiency, safety and cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the efficiency of the airport and why it is vital for the airport to operate efficiently, in answer to a question on notice the minister advised me on 2 December 1996 that in 1994 Australian exports valued at $6 billion go through Kingsford Smith&mdash;`35 per cent of Australia's total airfreight exports'. The `income generated from tourism through Kingsford Smith' is $13 billion. It generates eight per cent of Sydney's total work force; $3.9 billion is directly generated by Sydney airport to the New South Wales economy and that has a $7.7 billion flow&hyphen;on to the rest of the New South Wales economy. The answer states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are 35,000 jobs directly related to operations at Sydney Airport, with a further 33,000 jobs attributed to the flow&hyphen;on from the airport.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In those circumstances you do not hamper the efficiency of an extremely busy and extremely vital operation. The Hume Highway to Canberra is a four&hyphen;lane highway with two major strips of road. Of course, if you put an intersection across that major highway you are going to impede efficiency. But we are not talking about cars going at 110 kilometres per hour, we are talking about massive jumbo jets going at about 300 kilometres an hour before they take off&mdash;effectively without brakes. Of course that cross&hyphen;runway impedes efficiency, and that was acknowledged in the minister's answer to me.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hence he said, effectively, that is why the east&hyphen;west runway can only operate in the off&hyphen;peak periods. The reality is that it is costing money, as the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) mentioned earlier. It is a cause of delay. The minister himself experienced that on 17 May this year when he was flying around Sydney because of the delays caused by the operation of the east&hyphen;west runway. In fact, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> reported on 12 August that Qantas Airways had lost just over $90 million from delays in 1995&hyphen;96. Qantas said that the departure delays at Kingsford Smith were 10 times worse than the average for Australian and overseas airports. That is a disgrace, and that has been caused by the inefficient crossing runway configuration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps even more vital than that are the safety repercussions. In an answer dated 15 May, to me, the minister confirmed that there had been 161 incidents between May 1996 and 31 December 1996. That is about five safety incidents a week that happened, and no doubt they are still happening at Kingsford Smith each week. We are talking about a very serious situation in terms of the consequences of a very busy airport now running with a crossing runway configuration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, between January this year and 26 May there were 116 aborted take&hyphen;offs. Throw aborted take&hyphen;offs into a crossing runway configuration and you are looking at a disaster. But they are not my words. Let us look at the words of the experts, the professional pilots. The Australian International Pilots Association spokesman, Bill Pike, said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> on Monday, 12 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you keep pushing the averages for long enough, you'll end up with an aeroplane in the grass.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was expressing objection to the fact that this minister is requiring planes to use the east&hyphen;west runway when the crosswinds exceed the international standard of 15 knots per hour. Indeed, a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  article on 25 April this year covers the same story: the objections to using the crossing runway in those crosswinds. The comment was made that Sydney was the only airport in the world, to the knowledge of the International Pilots Association, which operated above 15 knot crosswinds for noise abatement 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8818"> purposes. That is code for political purposes. We are putting lives at risk. We are risking putting planes in the grass&mdash;in other words, crashing&mdash;because of purely political considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other professional body involved, the air traffic controllers, in a letter to Airservices Australia&mdash;this is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of 25 March this year&mdash;blamed `intense community pressure' to spread aircraft noise for `unsound procedures'. The letter said `the changes did not undergo any risk assessment and were made against the advice of senior staff'. There was a similar report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> on Friday, 6 June:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Controllers are a lot more frustrated&mdash;they are working under pressure and are more likely to make mistakes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is in the context where the draft operating plan&mdash;the recommendation to the minister, recommendation 27&mdash;said that, as a precondition to implementing the long-term operating plan, it was necessary to have an independent safety expert from overseas, without connections to the Australian bureaucracy, conduct a safety audit of the proposal. That still has not been done, and I pity the incoming minister because a disaster is on his head because of the irresponsible acts of the former minister in not having a safety audit, nor, for that matter, from my constituents' point of view, any environmental impact statement procedure at all, despite the boasting about the EIS procedure which is happening at Badgerys Creek. What I am talking about is a very significant safety issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The really biting and telling comment that I have is a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 22 April by Captain Michael Glynn. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a pilot operating large aircraft out of Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. Last Sunday afternoon, when the wind was straight down the long north&hyphen;south runway, the duty runway was the much shorter east&hyphen;west runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason for this ridiculous situation is the political desire to "share the noise". Had I had a problem which required me to abort at high speed, the cross&hyphen;wind and downwind components on the east&hyphen;west runway could have placed in jeopardy the aircraft and the lives of 200 passengers. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The former speaker, the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), was a lawyer. He knows that that constitutes notice. Having been forewarned, to ignore that warning would make those responsible personally liable for the consequences of a tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have this to say, regrettably: if the minister continues to allow public pressure from the electorates of North Sydney and Bennelong to dictate what happens to the efficiency of Sydney KSA and the safety of KSA, there unquestionably and regrettably has to be a serious incident at KSA. The new minister, regrettably, is going to cop the consequences of that because of the completely irresponsible attitude of the former minister. As the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> said on 9 February 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . after all the ducking and diving over this issue, there is reason to suspect that the goal of winning votes&mdash;or at least of avoiding losing votes&mdash;has taken precedence over the goal of making the system work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is unquestionably the case. The government is not interested in the safe and efficient operation of Sydney Kingsford Smith airport. Where it is coming from is completely and utterly poll driven from the point of view of the electorates it wants to win. The effect it is having on my electorate is devastating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first speaker from the opposition, the member for Melbourne, gave some specific examples. I can tell you that I have parents ringing me up and telling me that their children's education is suffering because of planes flying over between 11.00 a.m. and 3.00 p.m.&mdash;bearing in mind that we are copping it all the time then because that is an off&hyphen;peak period&mdash;and then between 7.30 p.m. and 11.00 p.m., when their kids are being kept up and become so fatigued at school the following day that their concentration is suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This facade of sharing the noise is simply that. It is a fraud quite literally because the minister has confirmed in that initial question on notice which I read that the east-west runway can only be used in off&hyphen;peak periods. My electorate is literally copping a bombardment during those concentrated periods, together with the weekend period. In the great 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8819"> majority of instances that I have witnessed the wind conditions have been such that they can take off over the fishes in Botany Bay, not threatening or inconveniencing anyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are points that I would like the new minister to take on board&mdash;the safe and efficient operation of Sydney Kingsford Smith airport. It is too essential to the economy of our nation and it is too essential to the lives of people who live around the airport to let political considerations dictate the operations when the experts are advising to the contrary. I hope the new minister brings to bear some  commonsense in this situation. To allow other speakers to speak in the time allotted tonight, I will conclude on that point.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R309">Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997</XREF> before the House. Before I go into the major thrust of what I want to say, there are a couple of matters raised by the former speakers, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) and the member for Barton (Mr McClelland), that I want to make passing reference to. The honourable member for Melbourne tried to give the impression that no flights go over the electorate of Bennelong. That is absolutely wrong. In fact, all the northerly landings overfly Bennelong. What has happened is that there has been a very substantial reduction in the number of flights over Bennelong. That was just, and that was what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised in sharing the noise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter I want to raise is in regard to the member for Barton saying that in the last days of the Keating government $600 million was provided in the budget for the building of the new Badgerys Creek airport. The fact is that it was not in the budget; it was in the forward estimates. That is quite a different story, as the member for Barton knows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing it is important to draw to the attention of the House is that once again we have before us an opposition that is saying, `But if only we had one more year in government after 12 years we would have built a new airport.' When we came to government, and even prior to coming to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government, when the matter of Badgerys Creek was raised, the first question everybody raised was: where is the full EIS? There was no full EIS. The last EIS done by the former government was about 12 years ago. That was not upgraded. So how can you talk about a new airport being fast tracked by the Keating government when you had not even done a full EIS?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was why the $600 million was removed from the forward estimates. How could you put it in the budget when you have not made allowances for the EIS to be completed? The other thing the incoming Prime Minister said was that we were not going to sell off Sydney airport until the noise issue had been resolved. That was a promise made and a promise maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill we are debating today is another commitment from the Howard government that is a promise fulfilled. I refer to the Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill which caps movements at Sydney's KSA at 80 aircraft movements in any one hour. In my view, an equally important provision in the bill is for the development of a slot management scheme that is intended to administer the movement cap at Sydney's KSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that regional airlines will be guaranteed slots thereby fulfilling the coalition government's election commitment to ensure services for the commuters of regional New South Wales to and from Sydney airport. This also means that no government in the future can play around with the 80 movements per hour cap by replacing the regional and non&hyphen;scheduled flights with the biggest, heaviest, dirtiest and loudest of the jets so as to maximise the number of passengers. Of course, that can still be done by another government. However, the alarm bells would be ringing loud and clear and the one million Sydney residents would rise as one to fight against such a proposed measure which is unlikely to pass through both houses of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An additionally important measure incorporated in the bill allows the minister to reduce the cap after consultation with interested parties. We are now almost at capacity at Sydney airport. In fact, during peak periods, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8820"> the airport is already up to 75 movements per hour. It is also important to note that, when enacted, the bill includes very strict compliance requirements with penalties up to $220,000 per infringement for unauthorised flights. Repeated infringements could result in the airline losing an allocated slot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process will be overseen by a ministerially appointed slot manager whose role will be to administer a slot management scheme. The slot manager will be backed up by a compliance committee to develop and oversee the enforcement provisions. This now means that no-one should be under any misapprehension that the Howard government is anything but firmly and decisively committed to a new 24 hour international airport in the Sydney basin, and that is at Badgerys Creek. The die is cast. There is no going back. It is all systems go. Delaying tactics by anyone and/or by the New South Wales Carr Labor government are to be condemned by all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has developed the new long-term operating plan to share more evenly and fairly the burden of aircraft noise over Sydney and to maximise flights over water and non-residential areas. One million residents of Sydney have suffered aircraft noise and pollution for far too long. Tens of thousands suffered unbearable levels of noise and pollution under the federal Labor government, a torture that no Australian should have been subjected to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I well remember the closure of the east-west runway under the Brereton plan that saw the emergence of the Drummoyne corridor and the Bennelong funnel. All take-offs and landings were to the north of Sydney airport. The greatest winners were the constituents of the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), the then minister for transport, and Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the inner west of Sydney, where were the then federal Labor member for Lowe and the current state Labor member for Drummoyne? All we heard were some muted and reluctant criticisms but no action. There is one thing I am absolutely certain about with regard to Australians&mdash;that is, they have a basic and decent concern for their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fellow Australians. That is why they embrace the new coalition government's policy of sharing the noise and thereby sharing some of the discomfort. However, greater relief will only occur when a new international airport is built&mdash;a policy decision that was a model of procrastination and indecision under the former federal Labor government which stand condemned for not acting and not making a fair dinkum decision on this issue during the past 10 to 12 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there were some promising signs exhibited by the Carr Labor government, especially the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, who repeatedly called for the fast&hyphen;tracking of Badgerys Creek. I will not go through all the quotes that have been attributed to Bob Carr as the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) has made very extensive reference to them. My general view is that these calls were much needed. Of course, when we came to government, the calls from the Carr government even intensified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that Badgerys Creek has been chosen; now that the Howard government is pushing ahead with Badgerys Creek; and since former minister Sharp made it public that there is nothing in the draft EIS to preclude Badgerys Creek from going ahead, the Carr Labor government has made a backflip of enormous proportions thereby stabbing in the back not only the million or so residents of Sydney but also his federal Labor colleagues, all for one sole objective&mdash;to save some of his western Sydney state seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor state members of parliament for the inner west of Sydney and their council colleagues were found wanting in the past. Some of them gave as an excuse the not unreasonable defence that they could only do so much as the federal Labor government could override them. They cannot continue to use that excuse as the federal coalition government wants to proceed with Badgerys Creek as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The veto is coming from none other than their own state Labor government. Yet where are those Labor heroes now in standing up for the inner west? They are abject failures in representing the people of the inner west of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8821"> Sydney. I do not refer to federal Labor members; I refer to state Labor members. I make quite a distinction on this very important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some two weeks ago I wrote to 80 local government councillors from the inner west and to five Labor state members asking for a bipartisan approach to the issue and for them to publicly state their support for Badgerys Creek. I wish now to place on record the results of the questionnaire which clearly demonstrate that three of the five state Labor members of parliament&mdash;the Hon. Paul Whelan, the Hon. Andrew Refshauge and Kevin Moss&mdash;could not be bothered to reply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst Sandra Nori only gave very weak and qualified support for Badgerys Creek, I must say that the greatest disappointment was the reply from the Hon. John Murray who waffled and made no effort to take a decisive stance for Badgerys Creek or to rebuke the state Labor leadership who are, by their very actions, attempting to condemn the residents of the Drummoyne electorate and the residents of the inner west to continuing noise, without hope of the huge relief that can only occur when the new 24 hour international airport is built at Badgerys Creek. For that, these five Labor members stand condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I foreshadowed earlier, I now list for the record the names of the councillors who have chosen to not reply or to oppose Badgerys Creek. They have been given the opportunity to stand up for their constituents and they have been found wanting. They have now forfeited their right to contribute with credibility on any debate on aircraft noise issues. They and those who refused to answer the questionnaire have failed to fight for our community and they stand condemned. I will list them by council.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I congratulate the people of Sydney's North Shore and the people of Sydney's inner city, inner west and east on the benefits this bill will bring them, while I join with the rest of the opposition members in supporting the government's intention to cap flights at Sydney to 80 movements per hour and while I congratulate the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) on his original private member's bill&mdash;which has now pushed the government into passing these cap restrictions and placing them in a situation where they had to bring it into legislation&mdash;I regret to say that, despite the bill's positives, it simply confirms for me that we have a government which is unwilling to extend a similarly sympathetic ear to the people of Sydney's west when it comes to the proposed development of Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill  reinforces for those us who live in western Sydney that we now have a government which is happy to pass strict legislation benefiting the residents of the North Shore and the inner suburban areas of Sydney, relieving them from the sometimes intolerable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8823"> burden of aircraft noise, but a government which is not willing to even consider alternatives or relief measures in regard to Badgerys Creek airport&mdash;should it ever be built&mdash;for our benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it would not have recognised it when putting this bill together, this is the latest in a long line of insults from this Howard government to the people of western Sydney. It is what it does not say in this bill that really counts for us. It is what it does not say in this bill that really hurts us in western Sydney. This piece of legislation at least proves that this Howard government is capable of being sensitive to the needs of Sydneysiders and their concerns. I am therefore left scratching my head and wondering, `What did we do wrong in western Sydney to deserve such opposite treatment?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is this Howard government willing to subject residents of western Sydney to unsafe and unreasonable noise levels with Badgerys Creek but it is now, with this bill, willing to alleviate the noise burden of residents around Kingsford Smith airport? Why is this Howard government willing to cover the residents of western Sydney with increased levels of pollution, contributing to the already disturbing asthma levels our kids in the west are suffering these days, yet it is willing to cut down on pollution by capping aircraft movements for the people around Kingsford Smith airport?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has double&hyphen;crossed and betrayed the people of western Sydney in relation to Badgerys Creek from pillar to post. It remains unmoved by reasonable suggestions to even look at alternative sites for the airport. It remains unmoved over the matter of Badgerys Creek's planned 24&hyphen;hour operations. Yet here it is in this House now making sure it does the right thing by the inner suburban residents of Sydney. Something is definitely wrong with this picture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have the residents of Sydney's west done to deserve such prejudicial treatment? Why is it that their need for nights free of screaming jet noises is not considered as pressing or as reasonable as those residents who are now bothered by Kingsford Smith's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> operations&mdash;complete with a curfew, I might add?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government would not dream of allowing Kingsford Smith to operate on a 24&hyphen;hour basis. Why is it then happy to subject western Sydney residents to just that? Why does the government continue not even to recognise that there might be at least a scrap of good sense in the proposal to build Sydney's second international airport at Goulburn in conjunction with the very fast train?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of western Sydney can come to only one conclusion as to why this Howard government extends the offer of an aircraft movement cap to people bothered by Kingsford Smith; why it quite rightly allows them to benefit from an airport curfew; why it listens to their concerns, yet why conversely it still refuses to take on board any similar concerns we have in the west&mdash;it simply does not think we are worth it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government is obviously more concerned about the people&mdash;or perhaps, I should say, the electorates&mdash;under the flight paths of Kingsford Smith than it is for those people who will be swamped by planes using Badgerys Creek, if it ever gets built there. These are the only conclusions we in the west can now draw, because the government has done nothing to convince us otherwise. The bill before the House, despite the good it may do, does nothing to change that belief. If anything, it merely rubs salt into our wounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the coalition's hands, the plans for the Badgerys Creek site&mdash;which were originally, I might add, for an overflow airport in support of operations at Kingsford Smith, with aircraft operations limited to 270,000 plane movements per year&mdash;were thrown out in favour of plans to build an international airport of enormous size, complete with 360,000 operations per year. New runway plans were added to the proposals. Plans for the original runways were also lengthened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within weeks of the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) taking over the job, he was on Sydney's airwaves, betraying promises made just a few weeks prior to that election in March 1996 and fanning the flames of fear 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8824"> and apprehension felt by western Sydney residents over Badgerys Creek. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Warwick Parer, our Shadow Minister for Aviation prior to the election, indicated that if . . . the EIS said that it was the wrong place for an airport, we'd have to take that into account before we went ahead with it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, what Senator Parer said prior to the election was that, if the EIS result proved negative, a coalition government would not&mdash;and I emphasise `not'&mdash;go ahead with the construction. The former Minister for Transport and Regional Development was now saying that he would merely `take it into account' before he built at Badgerys Creek. A very different kettle of fish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next came the government's alternative plans for Badgerys Creek&mdash;option B and option C&mdash;each with a third major runway as part of their plans. Yet none of this was mentioned prior to the election. Just as the now rejected plans for Holsworthy were conceived in secret and without the knowledge of the residents of western Sydney, so too were these new options which promised a much larger development at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was becoming all too apparent that what this Howard government stood for was an airport at Badgerys Creek and hang the consequences. Whether it be option A, B or C, whatever the EIS turned up and whether we liked it or not&mdash;somehow, some way, Badgerys Creek was going to get up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What of the draft EIS process itself? When the former minister for transport announced the new EIS process last year, he said that it would be transparent and very fair. He said it would be his practice to encourage the public to participate and to engage them in every step of the decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what he said in practice. Then we have the reality. The draft EIS process has been shrouded in secrecy, closed to the public and swamped by cynical political manoeuvring. It has also led, according to independent analysis, to a series of incorrect and potentially disastrous findings in regard to Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former minister for transport has swathed the whole draft EIS process in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ridiculously paranoid levels of secrecy and security. For example, the auditors of the report, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, were subjected to the most outlandish rules and regulations by the former minister. The unparalleled levels of secrecy were such that the company was forced to make an official complaint to the former minister's office. So much for the open and transparent process we were going to get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even after the release of the draft EIS summary, the government's obsession with secrecy and keeping the public in the dark has continued. The government says that it plans to release the full draft EIS report for public comment for just 12 weeks. When? In the Christmas&hyphen;January holiday period. What kind of a cynical move is that if it is not intended to reduce the amount of public submissions and avoid as much controversy as possible?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the importance of the EIS and of Badgerys Creek, in such a climate the draft report is likely to be low on the priority list for many western Sydney residents who will be away during the Christmas period. As for only providing 12 weeks for the public consultation process, the draft EIS, despite its vast inadequacies, is a long and complex document&mdash;including some 15 technical papers. How does the government expect members of the public, let alone local government councils and the New South Wales state government, to subject the report to detailed and objective analysis in such a short space of time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A more adequate arrangement would be to allow at least six months for all the matters contained in the documents to be properly addressed. But that is not what the Howard government wants. These arrangements guarantee only the shortest amount of time for constituents to engage in local groups or to contact their local members in relation to the draft EIS report. The Howard government is intent on keeping a lid on the irreparable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8825"> damage that we now know Badgerys Creek airport will cause western Sydney, but this suits the government just fine. It does not want any comment. It does not want any criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After releasing the executive summary of the draft EIS, the former minister for transport was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The draft EIS completely dispels the concerns that many of us had when we came into office in regard to Badgerys Creek airport. The draft EIS clearly indicates that Badgerys Creek is a superior site.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet independent authorities have raised serious doubts about the authenticity of the EIS and the former minister's faith in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales government's Environment Protection Agency report into Badgerys Creek has found that Badgerys Creek will have a `disproportionate impact on photochemical smog' in the area and would be a major source of the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide. It also said that the noise levels generated by the airport would expose many people to significant noise levels which would `exceed Australian standards'. Finally, it said that the former minister for transport's draft EIS summary:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . did not demonstrate the real impacts on the community for any particular site option.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Director&hyphen;General of the EPA, Mr Neil Shepherd, backed up his report's findings by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are serious deficiencies in the Commonwealth's approach and the information available and the EPA is concerned about the implications of this development for air quality in the Sydney basin.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then there is the latest news which was contained in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  on Monday. A confidential draft state&hyphen;Commonwealth task force has reported to the government that to make Badgerys Creek and its rail links economically viable it will have to encourage population growth in the area by approximately 130,000 people. This will add dramatically to our region's air, water and noise pollution and exacerbate our already sky&hyphen;high unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's actions have shown not only that it is determined to expose western Sydney to perhaps the greatest envi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ronmental disaster in living memory&mdash;and, I might add, in a very secretive and underhanded manner&mdash;but that it is determined to do so in the shortest possible time and with the least amount of public consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to finish my contribution to tonight's debate by repeating something I have said many times before in this House&mdash;and I just add that all of us are meeting our obligation to keep the debate short tonight because the government is unable to get its business properly programmed in this House. In pushing against an airport at Badgerys Creek, in pushing for an airport at Goulburn in conjunction with the very fast train, I want not only what is best for my community but what is best for Sydney as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as I sympathise with the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit), the member for Grayndler, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) and the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) in relation to the noise burden their residents suffer at the moment, I do not see why I should support the same burden being passed on to the shoulders of the residents in my electorate or the electorates of the member for Chifley or the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield). Why should we subject our constituents to the problems that these members do not want in their areas? I do not understand why other members should support it either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Delivering the problems of Kingsford Smith airport onto western Sydney is not a solution; it is a recipe for disaster. We will not become the sinkhole for the problems of the inner city. Western Sydney will not accept the problems of the inner city area. All I am asking is that the Howard government show the same consideration to the people of western Sydney as it is showing to the people of the inner suburbs with this bill. Judging by its track record, I will not be holding my breath. The people I represent are very concerned about where we are going in the future with this particular Badgerys Creek proposal.</PARA></SPEECH>

It demonstrates that this government, unlike its predecessor, is prepared to put the interests of people&mdash;of everyday human beings&mdash;ahead of commercial and political self&hyphen;interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many Australians, including many of my constituents in the electorate of Bradfield, feel a deep sense of alienation from the political process. At times, for many, the direct relevance of one party governing as distinct from another is difficult to see or to appreciate. However, for over 44,000 Bradfield constituents, the election of the Howard government made a difference&mdash;a real difference. The election of the Howard government made a difference to their lives as the cruel concentration of air traffic over the western side of my electorate was eased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several months before the 1996 federal election, I went to a home at 2 Lovatt Crescent in West Pymble in my electorate. I went there at a quarter to six in the morning and, milling around outside, having heard that I was going to this home, were 30 or 40 people from the vicinity of West Pymble. At 6 o'clock on the dot, the first plane came over, and every 90 seconds there was another plane. It was so loud you could barely hear yourself think. The windows were rattling. It was extremely noisy and disruptive, particularly for young families. There were some people outside who were in tears. Had someone told me this happened 25 kilometres from the Kingsford Smith airport, I would not have believed it. I would have thought, `Well, this is nonsense.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people who still subscribe to the view that there is a class war in Australian politics and Australian life were quite dismissive, if not derogatory, of the impact of aircraft noise on people in my electorate. But it was so bad that, at one stage, I actually took a delegation of my constituents to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission because we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could not get the minister of the day, the current member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), to actually listen to the concerns of people in my electorate, many of whom&mdash;in fact 12,000 of whom&mdash;were severely affected by aircraft noise. Aircraft noise is much more to many of my constituents than one of a number of environmental pollutants. It is about what degree of control, if any, everyday human beings have over their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout that dreadful year in the lead&hyphen;up to the 1996 election, there existed a deep sense of alienation and powerlessness reinforced by the insensitive actions and words of the former minister, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith. In fact, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Aviation</EMPHASIS> in its November 1995 edition, editorialised by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sydney Airport doesn't have a noise problem. It doesn't have a third runway problem either. What it does have is a person problem. Namely that one man, unfortunately the Minister for Transport amongst other responsibilities, has his electorate at the western end of the runway. The entire problem of KSA begins and ends solely with Laurie Brereton and that problem will unfortunately not go away until he and his government are voted out of office. Simple as that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of this bill is to place a maximum limit on the number of aircraft movements per hour at Kingsford Smith airport and provide for the development of a slot management system to administer the cap at KSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There must be no more than 80 aircraft movements in any one hour, the compliance with which will be monitored by Airservices Australia with quarterly reporting to the minister. The report to the minister will be tabled in the parliament&mdash;somewhat different to the management conducted by the previous government and the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith in particular. A slot manager will be appointed to develop and administer the scheme with the support of a compliance committee to develop and oversight enforcement provisions. Stringent penalties will apply to unauthorised aircraft movements, although emergency and essential aircraft will be exempted from the slot system. Slot controls will relieve the problems associated with peak period cluster scheduling, while implementing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8827"> the government's commitment to cap Sydney airport at 80 movements per hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to stress that there are major policy differences between the Labor and Liberal parties on this issue. For many of my constituents, the change of government represented a real difference to the real lives of human beings who had lost every confidence that they should have had in any government, in particular the previous one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On election day last year, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>&mdash;for the benefit of the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), who seems to have some short&hyphen;term memory problems&mdash;published the policies of the respective parties on the Sydney airport management. It is worth reminding the House that Labor promised the following. There would be no reopening of the east&hyphen;west runway. They would retain the narrow flight corridors which unfairly and cruelly concentrated noise. Under Labor, there would be a capping of aircraft movements to an average of 85 movements per hour. That means that for some hours of the day you might have 40 to 50 movements but for other hours of the day you might have 100 to 110. In other words, not only were they prepared to continue the inhumane treatment of people along that northern, concentrated flight corridor but they were actually prepared to make it worse for some parts of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government is about fairness. It is not about picking favourites. It is not about doing the things that serve the particular interests of certain electorates that you want to hold. It is about governing for all people, whether they be people in a relatively privileged part of Sydney, such as my electorate, or whether they be people who live in electorates such as Werriwa, Barton, Banks, Prospect, Lindsay and seats in the outer west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor also said that the second airport would be open&mdash;and please do not laugh as I say this, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;by at least 2001, it would be a 24&hyphen;hour airport and construction would be reliant on airport privatisation. All this from a party which I understand has had, and continues to have, great difficulty with the concept of privatisation. The reality in relation to the second 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> airport, as distinct from the rhetoric, was that, out in the western suburbs of Sydney, Labor had gone to enormous lengths after the 1993 election to build a belief&mdash;a cruel belief, in one sense&mdash;that Badgerys Creek airport would be fast tracked to be ready for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. But as Mark Riley said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 23 January 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most people would reasonably assume that `fast tracking' involved something happening quickly.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is obvious to anyone who has been to the site that the only thing that has happened quickly is the growing of grass. There is also an information hut, a cyclone fence, the odd drain and a few bemused cows. The problem with the paralysed Keating government on this issue was that it did not want to take a risk. All it sought to do was give the appearance of action, of protecting residents from any environmental problems, as the cows, fence and growing grass were `fast tracked'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same way Labor deceived people in Sydney's west on tolls, they deceived people on the second airport at Badgerys Creek. The slot controls to which this bill gives effect should underpin schedule reliability, which should improve the confidence of business travellers getting in and out of Sydney airport on time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the airport is already handling up to 75 movements an hour during peak periods, slot controls will also help manage anticipated demand on Sydney airport. Each aircraft will need a specific landing and arrival time. Consistent failure to comply with the slot system will see airlines lose their slot allocation, or they will be fined and the size of the fine will increase exponentially after the first offence. Clearly, this is a superior piece of legislation to that which was proposed earlier last year by the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with the current system is that it does not prevent airlines from scheduling a number of flights at the same time, and we end up with cluster scheduling, which is one of the principal reasons that many business travellers and members of this House spend so much time circling around in the sky in a holding pattern, waiting to get into Sydney airport.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8828">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This cap on aircraft movements through Kingsford Smith, if it were a stand&hyphen;alone measure, if it were the only thing that we were doing, would, in the words of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper editorial of 31 January 1996, be `politically necessary but can be self&hyphen;defeating. By pushing up the effective cost of a slot, it encourages the airlines to bring in bigger and noisier planes at peak hour. The longer term solution must be some better combination of runways, flight paths and restrictions at Kingsford Smith Airport and, eventually, Badgerys Creek.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been delivered by this government and, in particular, the former minister for transport&mdash;and this was one of the tragedies of seeing him resign last week&mdash;is a coherent and coordinated policy for the management of air traffic in and out of Sydney. We are also in the process of delivering&mdash;despite some short&hyphen;sighted and self&hyphen;interested opposition from the other side&mdash;a long&hyphen;term policy, a long-term operating plan, for Kingsford Smith airport. We also have a strong political commitment to a second airport, which will probably be at Badgerys Creek, clearly subject to the appropriate environmental and economic impact statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not often agree with the member for Grayndler, but he put it so well and so honestly when he was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 1 February 1996 as saying that he felt a coalition government was capable of fixing the problem. He told ABC Radio on 1 February 1996 that `only a Labor or a Liberal government can fix the problem'. He also went on to concede that the then Labor government was responsible for the aircraft noise problem. In contrast to this outbreak of honesty, only 18 days later, in an opinion piece published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, the then transport minister and member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's policy is in stark contrast to the Coalition's plan to dramatically increase aircraft noise right across Sydney. John Howard's `share the noise' programme&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">as the then member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith then described it&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will allow aircraft</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to stray from the restrictive flight paths and will force Airservices Australia to reopen the east&hyphen;west runway. Not only will this reduce safety, it will spray aircraft noise all over Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Brereton continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">referring to Mr Howard&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">says there will be less noise for residents north of Sydney&mdash;but the Coalition now admits international wide&hyphen;body jets will continue to use the North&hyphen;South runway exclusively. Under the Coalition there will be no noticeable reduction in noise for residents currently affected.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is like so many things that have been said by the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith and by many on the other side in the hypocrisy of their political opportunism now in opposition. Aircraft noise, for the vast majority of people living in Sydney, is manifestly better; it is considerably better. There are people whose lives were on the verge of destruction, and they were suffering under a government that was so insensitive that it would not listen to the concerns of everyday human beings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I were to give the Labor Party just a little bit of advice on how to restore its electoral fortunes, it would be to actually listen to people, to listen to their everyday concerns&mdash;to not impose upon them, without adequate consultation, mobile phone towers, overhead aerial broadband cabling, aircraft noise and all sorts of things which make people feel that they have no control and no say over the things that are happening to them in their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding, I would like to pay tribute to some people in my electorate who are everyday people. These are not wealthy silvertails; they are people who are working, trying to raise families&mdash;I know that most are struggling with fairly substantial mortgages. I just name some of them. There is a lady called Vicki Riddy. The first time I met her she was pushing a pram with a young baby, and she had a toddler with her. She was in tears. She lives in Turramurra in my electorate, and she was exasperated. I do not know what her politics are, but I do know that she had not always been a supporter of the Liberal Party. All she was looking for was someone who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8829"> would listen. I think it is fair to say that she is grateful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also mention: John Clark, who lives in West Pymble and has represented my electorate on the Sydney Airport Community Forum; Valerie Bray, previously with the Ku&hyphen;ring&hyphen;gai Think Tank and an acoustic engineer who did some outstanding work in measuring the extent of aircraft noise throughout our electorate; Derek Frere, who has had numerous meetings with Airservices Australia officials, with the minister's chief advisers and with me; and Terry Insley, from the North Shore Aircraft Action Group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to recognise, in particular, the former minister, John Sharp. I always found him to be someone who was prepared to listen to a reasonable argument. Despite his extremely busy schedule&mdash;and, despite my best efforts, the very secure margin of Bradfield in terms of returning a Liberal member&mdash;he was even prepared to see individual members of my electorate who were concerned and on the verge of psychological despair over aircraft noise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to recognise Ernestine Gross, who did an enormous amount of work and regarded aircraft noise, under Mr Brereton, as `urban terrorism'. She wants Kingsford Smith airport closed for good. I do not know whether that is going to happen, but that is what she wanted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to pay tribute to Mr R.G. Stanley, who lives in West Gordon. He never hesitates to write an abusive letter. One of them started with the words `Another Sunday morning'&mdash;and I will not give the final word.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night, the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) told us of the proposal for Avalon airport, which was once used by the defence forces and is now used merely for training purposes. This airport consists of an 8,300 acre com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> plex, and it would be an ideal dedicated air freight hub that could service the whole of the south-east of Australia. Such an idea is being proposed by an alliance under the Habitat Trust. Since hearing the proposal over two years ago, I have been working closely with the member for Corio, and I believe this could be of enormous benefit to Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming from a rural electorate like Lyons, one of the major stumbling blocks to exporting for many of the primary producers is the transport of their goods. It applies particularly to perishables. I have seen for myself cartons of salmon sitting on the tarmac in the sun, waiting to be loaded along with a whole lot of suitcases. This works up to a point but, if something breaks down or there are delays, a shipment can lose its market very quickly and the goods are useless for sale anywhere else. Tasmanians could grow more and we could export more, if only we had a reliable and fast transport system from the farm gate to the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dedicated freight services are not new to the world. Israel has one of the most efficient systems that can export overnight to anywhere and any continent. Australia can do the same, but we need to gear up to do so. Such a development cannot happen in a great hurry but, if we have the system, the world can be our oyster&mdash;if not have our oysters within 24 hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A system has to be reliable, it has to be fast and it has to be able to be tracked right from the door to any particular stage of the transport system. The less it is off-loaded, the easier it is followed in the process. The customer needs to know where their goods are at any point in time. This can be established electronically, provided the freight company has the vision to apply the quality assurance standards like other industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far, I am less than impressed with Australia's freight systems. I think I have already told the House that it took me more than six weeks to bring a carton of wine from Tasmania to Canberra. The whole time it was in transit, I could not verify where it was. Even the mail to Tasmania is slow. It takes three days from Canberra. So I can imagine the frustration of primary producers who want 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8830"> to catch early markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong or Jakarta. I know of one company which became so desperate that it chartered its own aircraft, but it is not an economic thing to do on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe such a proposal as Avalon has these ingredients and could be the catalyst for Tasmania to become one of the major primary product exporters in Australia. We do a lot now, but we could increase our output tenfold, and later a thousandfold, if such a system can be developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a recent trip to Indonesia and Thailand, I made a point of checking the supermarket shelves in some of the major centres. A few of our packaged meat products are there, but most of the dairy products come from New Zealand and Holland. Other products come from Canada and the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why isn't Australia at the forefront? Indonesia is our nearest neighbour. Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and some parts of New South Wales could benefit hugely by having a facility such as that being described in the Avalon project. State governments must put aside their parochialism and start thinking together to develop a regional transport hub and put their energies into ensuring that the infrastructure is up to supplying such a hub. I would like to see an integrated system in Tasmania geared to this, using fast catamaran freight services, a dedicated aeroplane and train and truck transport system, and a link to a single port/airport with the primary task of moving freight fast and efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania has a long way to go to sort out its transport system. I do not believe we will do that in a hurry.

The rhetoric being trotted out again now by the other side is almost the same rhetoric, word for word, as you will find in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  for April 1976.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Across the waterfront scene, the government is really trying to talk about the container terminals of Sydney and Melbourne. In the loading of coal, we have some of the most efficient handlers in the world. Constantly, visitors from across the world come to look at the operation of my own port of Newcastle in the Hunter region because it is so good and it is so fast. Similarly, in the handling of iron ore, sugar and grains we are at world standard or close to world standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is really about trying to create political mischief in respect of the stevedoring industry. The stevedoring industry is, as I have said, really about the container terminals in Sydney and Melbourne. All our container terminal activity in this country put together does not equal one terminal operator in Hong Kong. That is how small it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with container terminals is that the people who use the terminals and the facilities of stevedores have little interest in the efficiency of those terminals or, more importantly, the efficiency of the transport 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8832"> chain to the terminal. The honourable member who rudely interjected earlier, the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), was a member of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure that inquired into that industry. Going back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to wharf</EMPHASIS> report of that committee, the Australian Shipping Users Group in its response to a question relating to the ignorance displayed by the importers/exporters community said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not a case of ignorance/disinterest as much as a question of priorities. Individual firms do not see the waterfront as a key issue compared with other more pressing problems (maintaining sales, avoiding industrial disputes) and so do not accord it, or its problems, a high priority.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Generally, for those people, transport cost as a percentage of total cost of the sale of a product is three to four per cent. So, therefore, there is no interest on their part.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the written submission of the Australian Shipping Users Group. You would not know, little fellow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that along the transport chain to the waterfront there are vast savings to be made&mdash;in excess of $1 billion a year in true micro-economic reform. Small changes in matching hours, better documentation, electric commerce, better arrangements and shift working arrangements need to be dealt with by the suppliers, the warehouse people, the freight forwarders, the customs brokers and all those parties at the stevedoring terminal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next to that is the work on the waterfront itself. There is room for improvement, but it is not going to be achieved by going about it the way we see this government doing&mdash;trying to beat up on people and label people. They do not really want a solution. As I said, go back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of April 1976&mdash;I will give those interested a copy of it&mdash;and you can see almost verbatim the same language, the same words, being used by those opposite who are not interested in improving performance. Rather, they are interested in political slanging matches and the old story of blaming somebody, because it is much more difficult 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to improve performance than it is to get up on your hind legs and brand somebody or label somebody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no better example of that than today. The coal companies in the Hunter region sell coal at a much faster rate than it can be loaded onto the ships so ships accumulate off the coast. Whom does the government blame? `It must be the trade unions.'

So, many of them are indeed welcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be said, however, that in the area of retail tenancies the government has squibbed what I feel to be one of the most important recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology Committee, and that is the adoption of a uniform retail tenancies code. Instead, the committee said, `We're going to take this issue back to the states. We're going to have a meeting of the relevant state ministers.' The committee talked about the constitutional limitations of the government and said, `Look, we can't legislate for this on a national basis.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is simply not true. The fact is that the corporations power gives Commonwealth governments the power to legislate in respect of corporations. It is almost certain that such a power would enable the Commonwealth to fix a uniform retail tenancies code with all the important provisions that such a code should have concerning disclosure, tenancy mix, the rights of retail tenants to form associations within shopping centres, and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that it is regrettable that the government has not acted in this area. I think it likely that retail tenants&mdash;who have, indeed, been waiting for some time for these recommendations and for the government's decision&mdash;will be kept waiting until we see the government's national benchmarks, until we see the action of the various state ministers when they are confronted by the federal small 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> business minister, until we see that state legislation. So we still have quite some distance to go in the area of retail tenancies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This comes against a background where the senior political adviser to the Prime Minister&mdash;at least until recently&mdash;Mr Grahame Morris, made all too clear what the government really thinks about business.

I would like to bring to the attention of the House a few of the issues that the subcommittee has looked at. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, I want to assure the House and Australians as a whole that this government ensures that people must have responsibility for the children they bring into this world. That is what we predicate our decisions on in this area. We ensure that there is accountability in this issue. We are deem 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing that any parent who has a liability for child support, regardless of their situation&mdash;be they on unemployment benefits or some sort of pension&mdash;be required to make a minimum payment of $260 a year. We have also broadened the base on which people have been able to limit their liability for child support payments by having such things as investment properties where they have been able to lower their taxable income and, in turn, reduce their liability to their children. This whole issue is about the welfare of children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also increased the exempt amount of income for those non-custodial parents who we acknowledge are finding it very difficult in these times to be able to get ahead and to restart lives. Not only has the exempt income been increased by 10 per cent but also we have acknowledged that where there is shared custody of 40 or 50 per cent, those same parents can then have another addition to that exempt income, recognising that they have a life to get on with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures that we have brought forward will not mean an end to this problem, with the difficulties of these emotional breakups of families; they are simply another step along the road that this government is taking.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Registration fees for export abattoirs will not increase from $35,000 per annum to $122,000. Registration charges for small to medium size abattoirs will remain at their existing rate of $30,350. The charge for large abattoirs will increase to $70,700, while medium to large establishments will increase to $60,700 from $30,350. New categories of small, medium and large have been introduced to ameliorate the impact on smaller establishments in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The statement that small abattoirs face a huge per unit cost per sheep compared to larger abattoirs is not correct. Exercises conducted by AQIS on the impact of the reform of the meat inspection service, including fee adjustments, indicate that the AQIS cost per unit varies from plant to plant regardless of size. The relative efficiency of production at each establishment dictates the cost per sheep or cattle unit flowing from AQIS's fees and charges. For example, many smaller establishments actually have a lower cost per unit of production than larger plants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The costs per sheep unit will not increase significantly for either small or large establishments. It is important to note that the larger establishments will have considerable scope to reduce their costs, as they will require less inspection units due to the outcomes being pursued under the reform agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) It is not true that the smaller export abattoirs are largely Australian owned and the large abattoirs foreign owned. Approximately 30 of the 73 export registered abattoirs are foreign owned. Of the top ten abattoirs in terms of volumes slaughtered for export, I understand that five are Australian owned and five are foreign owned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The justification of the fee adjustments is that they are one component of the Government's reform agenda for AQIS meat inspection services. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Other reforms have already commenced and for many participants in the export meat industry their combination with the fee changes will result in net reductions in payment to AQIS. The reforms, including the move to company-based inspection, will deliver significant savings and flexibility for the meat industry which will ultimately assist small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) It is not the intention to eliminate small abattoirs, indeed the new fee structure will assist in maintaining the viability of the smaller operators within the industry. The fee adjustments will, in the main, affect larger abattoirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) It would not be more equitable to impose the charges on a stock throughput or a per kilogram basis. The fees structure is designed to recover the fixed infrastructure costs through a registration charge and the inspection costs on a fee for service basis. All operators in the industry benefit from the inspection infrastructure in place to facilitate the export of meat, and as such, are required to contribute their share of the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) The reform agenda for AQIS meat inspection services is part of an overall betterment of the red meat industry. The Government is committed to delivering a substantial reform agenda for the industry, including substantial savings for processors through the restructuring of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC), Meat Research Corporation (MRC) and Meat Industry Council (MIC). The full package of reforms will ultimately enhance export competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The quantum of revenue collected by AQIS from industry in 1997-98 will not increase. The AQIS fee adjustments should therefore have no impact on prices being paid to farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) Prices paid to farmers, should not be affected by the AQIS fee adjustments.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The April, 1997 "Mykonos" verdict, issued by the German Supreme Court, was the first time that a court of law drew an explicit connection between a terrorist act and the Iranian Government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) The UN has documented and condemned the Iranian Government for human rights abuses, including against members of the Baha'i faith. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has called on Iran to resume its cooperation with the Commission, to abide by its obligations under the international human rights instruments and to implement fully the recommendations of the Special Representative and the Special Rapporteurs on religious intolerance and on freedom of opinion and expression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Guidelines do not cover Iran. They encompass those organisations and entities which Australia and most of the international community do not recognise as states; organisations and entities with which Australia and most of the international community restrict official contact; and organisations and entities where there may be

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I have no formal record of approach by the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV), however, I am aware of the RACV's concerns on such matters. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) prices are influenced by global markets. The Saudi Arabian government is the world's largest producer of propane and butane and therefore its "contract price" is used by most LPG producers as the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> marker price upon which exports and sales to wholesalers are negotiated. Since Australian LPG producers operate in a deregulated market, changes in international prices can be expected to flow on to local consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several factors influence the international price of LPG. LPG can substitute for naphtha (produced from crude oil) in those petrochemical markets where they compete as a feedstock. When naphtha prices increase due to tightness in the market, LPG is used by some petrochemical manufacturers for ethylene production, tending to drive prices upwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A seasonal increase in LPG demand (and with it, price) has occurred in the last three years with the onset of the northern hemisphere winter as LPG marketers rebuild stocks for consumption during the colder months. The severity of the northern winter will also affect demand. With the onset of spring there is a reduction in demand for LPG and consequent easing of pricing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prices are also affected by the value of the Australian dollar against the US dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, Saudi LPG is priced at $US172 per tonne, down $US158 per tonne from a peak of $US330 per tonne in January 1997. International observers suggest that prices have "bottomed out" for this year and rises can be expected over the coming months as northern hemisphere traders rebuild stocks.</PARA>
