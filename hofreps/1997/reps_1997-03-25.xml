<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has it been brought to the Treasurer's attention this morning that there is a further major problem with his 15 per cent superannuation tax package, caused in this instance by a botching of the amendment which was rammed through yesterday to correct a constitutional problem which he said did not exist? Has he been told that, in relation to a number of long established schemes, as the legislation now stands the burden of the new tax will not be borne by the high income earners themselves as intended but by the funds' trustees who can only recoup by reducing the earnings of all fund members, the vast majority of whom earn less than $70,000 or, alternatively, in some cases that that burden will have to be borne by the employers? Will he now acknowledge that he has made a comprehensive mess of the implementation of this legislation, and will he agree to withdraw and completely redraft it?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In my electorate of Lilley the landmark statement on small business by the Prime Minister yesterday was seen as a positive commitment by the government to small business and was very warmly received by small business in my electorate. Can the Prime Minister outline to the House what has been the reaction by small business at a national level to the raft of initiatives contained in the More Time for Business statement and can he indicate whether this package means that the task is now completed?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly can inform the member for Lilley, as I can inform all members of the parliament, that overwhelmingly the reaction of men and women speaking on behalf of small business to the government's package has been very positive. For example, Allan Handberg of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Statement will certainly have a very positive effect on small business growth and job creation in the medium term.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mark Paterson of ACCI said the reform plan would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . significantly reduce the compliance [costs] in small business and boost confidence . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ron Tomlinson of the Retail Traders Association of Victoria said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package would provide a substantial boost for employment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dr Ron Silberberg of the housing industry said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Initiatives in the Prime Minister's statement would significantly reduce the paper work and compliance burden for small business through liberalisation of FBT and unfair dismissal requirements. The government's response shows sensitivity to pressures facing small business. It will assist to strengthen small business activity and reduce regulatory costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Rob Bastian from the Council of Small Business Organisations, who on occasions in the past has not always led the chorus of praise for the parties of the coalition&mdash;in fact on odd occasions he has been found to say something mildly critical of the coalition&mdash;had this to say about the unfair dismissals:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2878">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That's obviously the jewel in the crown. That is one that will actually create jobs&mdash;and I am certain of it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The important thing to understand about the unfair dismissal reform is that something like 80 per cent of all businesses in Australia that employ people will have the benefit of this new unfair dismissal proviso. The new proviso will give new hope for the employment of young Australians by 80 per cent of all businesses in Australia. Those who are against this measure are against employing young Australians. That is what they are. Those who oppose it want to keep the kids on the unemployment list. If you think for a moment that that is a sinister, cynical and savage coalition attitude&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very plain that this package has gone to the heart of many of the concerns of the small business community. This package has more than delivered on our commitment. We have overdelivered on capital gains tax. We have overdelivered on unfair dismissal reform. We have delivered investment opportunities in small technology companies. We are well on the path to achieving our goal of reducing 50 per cent of the paperwork in our first three years of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, the Australian Labor Party is going around with a collective long face. They always look unhappy when there is good news for the Australian economy. You can bet on it. If you want to know how the Australian economy is doing, look at the glum faces opposite and you know it is doing pretty well. You are out of touch on this, as you have been out of touch on so many other issues.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the advantages to small business of the proposed exemption from the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I mentioned in the answer to the question asked of me by the member for Lilley that one of the significant features of the new unfair dismissal proposal of the government was that it would benefit about 80 per cent&mdash;I repeat: 80 per cent&mdash;of all the firms in Australia that actually employ people. That is a very high percentage of all the firms that employ people in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Dickson has asked me: what has been the reaction to the unfair dismissal provision? The reaction of small business has been very positive. The reaction of the opposition so far is a bit hard to work out. Perhaps, if we have a look at the reaction of the President of the ACTU, we might then be able to deduce what the reaction of the opposition is going to be. This makes very interesting reading. Last night, in an interview on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program, Jennie George, the President of the ACTU, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am assuming that the Labor Party will do the right thing and do what we're doing&mdash;opposing the extension of these unfair dismissal exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Labor Party senator was heard to say that the Labor Party would not be opposing the expansion in this exemption. I'd find that an amazing proposition for the Labor Party to be putting.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So there you have the riding instructions for the Leader of the Opposition. What everybody on this side of the House would like to know is: is the Leader of the Opposition going to oppose the unfair dismissal exemption or is he going to support it? Is he going to be told by Jennie George that he supports it? Is he going to stand shoulder to shoulder on a platform with Jennie George in opposing the unfair dismissal laws, like he stood shoulder to shoulder on 19 August last? You remember that very well. I think many Australians remember that. We would like to know from the Leader of the Opposition: are you going to do what Jennie tells you on this or are you going to have the guts to form your own view? Where do you stand? Yes or no? Are you for or against a measure that will help young Australians get work?</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

The second part of the answer is that, if you really want to share that aspiration with us, you will support this package&mdash;including the new unfair dismissal provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do not think you will. You know why? Because Jennie George has told you you're not allowed to. Jennie George has decided that you have to oppose this. It will be fascinating to watch the Labor Party writhe and wriggle and squirm on this issue. It will be fascinating to watch them. I will bet that at the end of the day you end up doing exactly what Jennie has told you to do&mdash;that is, oppose this measure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. In fact, the government's response to recommendation No. 27 for private certification of building approvals includes the inspection of the construction, self-certification and occupancy. I am sure that many members would know, and I am sure my colleague the member for La Trobe would know, that, in the building industry, delays in getting approvals, getting the certificates and even the certificate for occupation causes great delays and enormous costs to the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In responding in today's press on the Small Business Deregulation Task Force response, the Master Builders Association and the Housing Industry Association said that, for the building industry, the move has the potential of achieving savings of around $1 billion. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a very significant savings potential. The Building Codes Board, along with state and territory representatives, has made considerable progress in this area already under the existing arrangements in some of the state and territory jurisdictions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind them, in advocating the urgency, of those comments by Mr Bastian, who was the one person associated with small business here who has actually been quoted on what small business believed was the most significant thing that they could have. When interviewed, Bastian said, `Well, they want a tighter Trade Practices Act, and that is why we strongly support the harsh and oppressive conduct approach'&mdash;as indeed they do, because what we are talking about here is huge numbers of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you are talking about, for example, those potential beneficiaries of changes on the fringe benefits tax you are talking about something like six per cent of small business, not 94 per cent of them. There are a heck of a lot more, though, who find themselves franchisees and in any other situations where they are likely to be subject to oppressive conduct. But can the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs get this bill on here for debate? No, he cannot, because every time he does for the big end of town the Treasurer comes in over the top of him. With a great deal of energy he comes in over the top of him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one item that this government has actually managed to get a front page headline out of, as opposed to everything else they are doing, is their ability to sack people&mdash;not to create jobs but to sack people. The one front page they got today in an otherwise completely desultory result was their opportunity to sack people. Instead of finding opportunities to make Australians more insecure, what they ought to be doing is getting big business off the backs of small business.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. The financial system inquiry report, commonly known as the Wallis report, was commissioned some nine months ago and was asked to report by 31 March of this year. I expect that I will be in a position to receive the report and brief the government on the contents of it in the week commencing 7 April. I expect that therefore the report will be able to be released some time during that week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will of course announce its attitude towards the report at the time of release. There may be some things that the government responds to straightaway; there will unquestionably be a number of things that it will take some time for the government to develop a position on and announce a response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be made clear to all parties who conduct their commercial conduct that until the government announces a change of policy the current policy stands.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe that the financial system inquiry gives the government and the nation an opportunity to look carefully at the financial system to ensure that it is modern and efficient, that it caters for needs which are varied in a complex society and that it sets up a financial system which can be competitive and delivered to consumers for decades to come. That is certainly the way in which the inquiry has been approached. I see this as an enormous opportunity for the nation and the

I think it is very important that that be said and I think it is extremely important that that be said in defence of members on both sides of this House. I think all members of the House condemn abuse of privileges and all members of the House condemn anybody on the public payroll who takes advantage of a privileged

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for McEwen for her question and I acknowledge the significant contribution that she is making to the government's consultations on the work for the dole initiative. I am pleased to be able to report that there has been continuing enthusiastic support for the government's initiative and, of course, amongst the most enthusiastic supporters have been young people themselves. The government has already received numerous expressions of interest. Indeed, the number of expressions of interest we have already received in establishing pilot projects exceeds the number of pilot projects we intend to establish. We have not even called for submissions at the moment. So there is a great deal of interest out there in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the high level of community interest in this initiative, the government is consulting widely with community groups and on 27
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2884"> February, as part of this consultation, I met with 12 community groups. This was a very productive and constructive consultation and the government appreciates the input from all of those who attended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In answer to the member for McEwen's question, I did see a newspaper article yesterday which appears to have been based on the notes of one of the participants at that meeting. I must inform the House that the tenor of those notes does not actually reflect the consultation and, indeed, they show some misunderstanding of the nature of the scheme. Work for the dole is not a short&hyphen;term training program of the kind on which the previous government squandered so much of taxpayers' money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me illustrate the problems that arise when a journalist relies on one set of notes. I just quote one example of this. The Australian Council for Volunteering, which was incorrectly identified in that article as the `Volunteers Association', was described in the article as `one of the equivocators about the work for the dole scheme'. Let me quote for the information of the House from a letter I have received since that consultation from Mrs Margaret Bell, the President of the Australian Council for Volunteering, about the consultation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Council for Volunteering would like to thank you for your involvement of the community in the discussions and to congratulate the government on these initiatives.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pretty clear why this equivocation is taking place on the other side of the House. The Labor Party is under enormous pressure, and none more so than the Leader of the Opposition. We have just seen that they are equivocating for the moment on the unfair dismissal provisions in the small business package that the government announced yesterday. They are equivocating because they are under pressure from Jennie George and the ACTU. They are equivocating on their economic policies because they are getting pressure presumably from people like Gough Whitlam who says, `This is not the time to back away from Labor's traditional support for an open economy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for this is that they are not getting leadership and direction from the Leader of the Opposition. We recall the comments of former Labor senator and minister Jim McClelland in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 3 March. He made the point that `Kim Beazley does not seem to have the fire in his belly to lead his languishing party out of the wilderness'. That is where the equivocation is taking place.

Secondly, I say in absolutely loud and clear terms to the nation, particularly to southerners, that tropical North Queensland is open for tourism business again right now, for Easter and for beyond, and that the airports of Cairns and Townsville are fully operational again. The Bruce Highway is reopening and the rail links are reopening. The best thing people who want to make a contribution to the recovery can do is to recommit to their plans to visit tropical North Queensland, and sooner rather than later.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question. The honourable member is correct in saying that my portfolio is disproportionately represented in litigation before the Federal Court of Australia. This is despite the fact that immigration and refugee applicants have access to a thorough merits review of their cases by my department. If they are unhappy with that outcome, they are able to seek independent merits review before a tribunal, so they have every chance to put their case. In addition, they can also access the Federal and High Courts of Australia, giving them up to three levels of judicial review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of refugee determination is a matter of very considerable importance to me, as I have emphasised before. I want to make it clear that I expect that any person with well-founded claims would have them accepted by my department at first instance. The United Nations Convention on Refugees requires us to provide asylum seekers with a full opportunity to present their claims and to have those claims assessed. Many countries have accepted that this should include an opportunity for merits review. However, there is no requirement to provide this at both the administrative level, as we do, and at the judicial level, which we also provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 60 per cent of administrative law cases before the Federal Court are immigration matters. In the 1995&hyphen;96 budget, there were litigation costs, involving my department, of $7.4 million, and that did not include the cost of legal aid, nor did it include the costs of running the courts or keeping people in detention while matters are resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are currently 623 active cases involving the immigration portfolio before the Federal Court, the Full Court of the Federal Court and the High Court of Australia. We know that a substantial proportion of these cases will be withdrawn prior to a hearing. Of those cases that do go to court&mdash;that is, that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have substantive hearings&mdash;my department currently wins 89 per cent. Of interest to members might be cases where people test and retest the system in order to obtain benefits. We have seen people delay their departure while seeking work rights and access to Medicare. We know that some people are now using litigation to add to those delays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague the Attorney&hyphen;General referred to a case recently involving illegal immigrants who came here on a boat codenamed the `Albatross'. They used legal aid to pursue the case through the Federal Court, the Full Court of the Federal Court and the High Court without success at any instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member asks me what we are going to do about it. Let me say this practice has added to delays in the courts and costs the taxpayers many millions of dollars. Too many people are using court action to delay departure, and this is an urgent matter requiring redress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes the solution to this problem is to limit judicial review. Wherever a decision maker makes a decision outside their jurisdiction or without the power to make it&mdash;in technical terms, that is called a privative clause&mdash;the government has received advice from several leading Queen's Counsel that this is an effective way to address this problem. Applicants will still be able to access full and fair merits assessment and review of their claims, but we cannot stand by and allow this situation to remain out of control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know this is a matter of interest and concern to members on both sides of this House. I look forward to cooperation from the opposition and others to implement this very sensible and important measure to help restore integrity and public confidence in the system.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to the remarks made by Mr Prescott. It would be common knowledge on both sides of this House that for some time&mdash;stretching back to the period when the former government was in office&mdash;the future of the BHP steelworks at Newcastle has been under discussion. It would be my hope that BHP could maintain for as long as possible a steel making capacity in as many industrial areas of Australia as possible, and I know the concern of the member about the future of the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that Newcastle is a very different community&mdash;and the Hunter Valley is a very different economic region&mdash;of Australia now from that which it was 20 years ago. Newcastle has taken strides to diversify. It is no longer as dependent on the steel industry. Although it is very proud of its tradition as one of the great steel cities of Australia, it has nonetheless been embarked for some years on a process of economic diversification. And the general optimism of the people of the Hunter Valley is much greater now than it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember going to Newcastle a few months ago to launch the locomotives at Goninans with my colleague the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, and it was very obvious that the people of the Newcastle district&mdash;including people in the unions, people in the local chamber of commerce, the civic leaders and the business leaders&mdash;were looking positively to Newcastle and were preparing Newcastle for a different future than the sort of city it was during the years immediately after World War Two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say to the honourable member that we are concerned, as I know he is, about the future of employment in the Hunter Valley and in the Newcastle area. We will certainly follow policies which are designed to improve the competitive position of BHP and which are disposed to improve the viability and competitiveness of all Australian industries. One of the great things about BHP in recent
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years has been the way in which it has been able to increase&mdash;and maintain at an increased level&mdash;a magnificent export performance. The company deserves credit for that, the unions that have participated deserve credit for that, and I will not be stingy about giving some credit to Senator Button for what he was able to do in relation to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those early years the former government did set about putting down some reasonable policies in some of those areas. But that was a long time ago. It was over the last four or five years that you really lost your way, and you lost it very badly, but we now have a situation where what we as a nation have to do is take every opportunity to improve the competitiveness of our industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say to the honourable member that when you have an inflation rate as low as the one we have now, when you have got interest rates which are falling and when you have got an industrial relations regime which is moving towards full-blooded enterprise bargaining&mdash;and I note in that connection that, whereas you lot opposite flirted with enterprise bargaining, you are now walking away from it and from the more competitive thing&mdash;you cannot have it both ways. You cannot claim that the industry policy you espoused when in government was a good policy. You then repudiated the underpinning of that policy and you are now pretending that what you are doing is absolutely right and absolutely consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say to the honourable member that we will continue to pursue policies which are designed to maximise employment in Australian manufacturing industry. I know the member for Newcastle asks the question out of a deep concern for the people that he represents, but I would counsel those opposite who think that just by making a couple of statements on the floor of a motor manufacturing outfit in Adelaide they have in some way won back the affection of the working men and women of Australia. This is what Mr John Sutton of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor is still to realise that Paul Keating's big picture policies are what forced 700,000 workers to switch their votes at the last election.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2890">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They want economic nationalism, they want to know what is good for Australian workers and they do not want the economic policies and the rubbish that they were force&hyphen;fed with for the last 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So do not imagine for a moment that you have won back the support of all of those people. Can I tell the member for Newcastle that we will be following policies to protect Australian manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as the six pillars policy is concerned, I would not be surprised if that were the subject of comment by the Wallis report. As the Treasurer said, the Wallis report is going to be published in a couple of weeks time. Until a government decision is announced on that, the present policy of observing the six pillars is maintained, and I endorse the warning delivered by the Treasurer that players in the financial community should await government decisions and not committee recommendations before they take decisions.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

This action follows representations which have been made directly by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, me and others, and I acknowledge the Leader of the Opposition made a visit to India last year. Pity the Prime Minister of the previous government never found the time to go to India.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We said when we gained government that we would put a focus on the bilaterals in addition to the regional and multilateral activity. We have done that and it is now reaping a good harvest. In respect of the tariff on coking coal with an ash content below 12 per cent, that will be reduced from five per cent to three per cent, while the tariff on non-coking coal will be halved to 10 per cent. At the same time, the tariff on imports of raw apparel wool will be cut from 25 per cent to 20 per cent and tariffs on wool tops from 50 per cent to 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coal is Australia's principal export commodity to India, valued at some $710 million for this year. We now expect a substantial increase with the expansion in India's steel making capacity over the next few years and the current level of around 11 million tonnes

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2892"> Amendment (Male Total Average Weekly Earnings Benchmark) Bill. If we are able to do that, we would be able to finish at 10.30 and then have the usual adjournment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that to achieve that it might be appropriate for us tonight to sit through dinner. I think that is a good idea so that we do not have an extended evening tonight.

We are just waiting to see how matters pan out this afternoon, but members are on notice that we expect that to be how things will be handled for the balance of today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of tomorrow, the expectation is that we will sit very late tomorrow night and into the early hours of Thursday morning. The Senate whips and leaders are meeting this afternoon, and we will then have a better idea of progress of matters in the Senate. But our expectation is that, as we go into the wee hours of Thursday morning, we will have a series of matters coming across to us from the Senate, as usual.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make and impress upon members of the government is that it is in your interests to urge the Leader of the House to actually get some priority in what comes from the Senate so we can have some sensible discussions about how the proceedings after tonight are handled. It is the intention on our side not to require us to sit on Thursday because people have made arrangements to get home.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government has done many outrageous and indefensible things during its first year in office but the worst stain of all on its record, and one that will be remembered by future generations long after everything else is forgotten, will be the abandonment confirmed by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) last weekend of its $4&half; billion promised superannuation co&hyphen;contributions. Let's cut through all the jargon and all the complexity of this issue and focus on the three big, ugly things that the government is doing by this decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first place, it is guaranteeing that a worker now in his or her mid&hyphen;30s will have over $100,000 slashed off the superannuation package, or retirement package, that he or she would otherwise be collecting. Whatever else is involved in this decision, that is the bottom line. If the government's promise is implemented, ordinary wage earners now will then be more than $100,000 better off. If the promise is abandoned, ordinary wage earners will be more than $100,000 worse off than they otherwise would have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second big and ugly thing that this superannuation decision is doing is raising a fundamental question mark that goes really to people's sense of security for the long&hyphen;term future&mdash;a question mark as to whether, in future decades, members of ordinary working families will be able to be sufficiently looked after in their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that Australia's population, like that of most developed countries, is rapidly moving from a traditional pyramid shape, in which those who were retired were supported by a much bigger base of younger people who were still working, to something approximating a skyscraper shape in which there is a much more equal distribution across those age bands. Previously, when a large working population has supported a relatively small retired population, that meant that we as a nation could afford a relatively generous pension scheme. But there is now, because of that change in demography, a very real doubt about whether that capacity will continue in the future. By making the decision now, in 1997, to abandon the compulsory co&hyphen;contribution arrangements, the government is condemning those who are going to be retiring in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2898"> 20, 30 or 40 years time to dramatically reduced retirement packages&mdash;some $100,000 less, as I have already said, than would be the case for an average weekly earner now. Quite possibly, as a result of the change in demographic structure and the changing ability to generate pensions in the future, we are condemning people by this decision&mdash;if it is taken by the government&mdash;to a dramatically reduced overall standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third big and ugly thing about this particular package we are looking at today, this decision not to proceed with the superannuation co&hyphen;contribution, is the government squandering the best opportunity that Australia has ever had to fundamentally change the pattern of Australian savings&mdash;to have a massive shift into private savings and a massive expansion of the national savings pool. When the full three plus three per cent contributions are taken into account, aggregate superannuation fund assets will rise from under $300 billion now to over $600 billion by the year 2005 and to around $2,000 billion&mdash;$2 trillion&mdash;by the year 2020. I will come back to the implications of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How is the government seeking to defend itself against these very significant charges that we are making? Basically, by trying to pull six different swifties, each of which I will deal with briefly in turn. Firstly, it is not the government's promise, they say; it is Keating's promise. Secondly, the government has some kind of different mandate for savings support which would be more or less equally beneficial. Thirdly, the co-contribution scheme is unfair to workers because it involves deducting moneys from their wages and salaries. Fourthly, they say that dismantling the scheme will not harm the future retirement benefits of young Australian workers. Fifthly, they say that the co-contribution scheme is unworkable in practice. And, sixthly, they try to pretend that the scheme will not do anything much to benefit national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the first point, this extraordinary suggestion that this is not the government's promise but it is Keating's promise, it is Labor's promise, which we have heard repeated endlessly&mdash;including by the Treasurer
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> yesterday and on the weekend in his television performance&mdash;doesn't the Treasurer, Mr Costello, recall the statement made by him in answer to a question from me after the budget in August last year when he said, `Who is going to pay the l-a-w tax cuts? The coalition. We are going to fund them and we are going to pay them'? Doesn't the Treasurer also recall his own election policy, the coalition's superannuation policy released in February last year, just before the last election, which contained the following unequivocal language:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Coalition Government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> will provide in full the funds earmarked in the 1995-96 Budget to <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> match compulsory employee contributions according to the proposed <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> schedule;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> will deliver this Government contribution into superannuation or like savings . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will inherit both Labor's proposal and expectation that has gone with it. We will deliver the full benefit of the proposed contribution . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Just to add something else, doesn't the Treasurer also recall adopting this Labor policy to the extent of repeating&mdash;precisely, word for word, comma for comma&mdash;in his budget paper last year exactly the same description of the measure which was contained in Labor's last budget paper in May 1995? If you do not believe me, check for yourself. I seek leave to table the comparative document accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Mr GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you do not believe me, check for yourself the precise wording of the description in the 1995-96 budget statement on page 3&hyphen;131, paragraph 6.8, and the precise wording by comparison&mdash;it is exactly the same&mdash;for the 1996-97 budget statement on page 3&hyphen;121, paragraph 6.8. It would make even the member Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) blush their collective heads in plagiaristic shame when they looked at the language that had been employed exactly picking up the language of the original Labor proposal. The evidence is compelling. What the government is doing in abandoning the promised $4&half; billion contribution is not just reneging, as it claims, on a Keating promise but reneging on its own coalition  promise&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2899">ratting or dogging on its own coalition promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the claim is made that the government has some kind of different mandate to deliver this earmarked contribution of funds into savings vehicles other than retirement vehicles. Might I make it clear that that is manifest nonsense. The truth of the matter is that the only flexibility the government has given itself in its many statements on this issue is to proceed with superannuation or like savings measures. It has always been anxious to preserve some flexibility as to the precise savings measures in question, but there is only one possible reading of that term in the English language that I know when you talk about superannuation or like savings measures, that is, savings measures directed towards securing retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe the government does have a better way of delivering retirement income savings as distinct from savings generally than under the co-contribution model. If so, let us hear about it. But it is going to be one hell of a good scheme&mdash;it is going to have to be&mdash;to deliver better returns to ordinary working Australian families than the $100,000 that they will be receiving on retirement if the co-contribution goes ahead. It is going to have to be one hell of a better alternative scheme to make up for the more than $100,000 they will lose if that does not go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next suggestion made, the third swiftie sought to be pulled, is that the scheme is somehow unfair because part of it does involve a deduction&mdash;at first, one per cent, then two per cent and then three per cent&mdash;from workers' incomes. But, of course, the point about that is as follows. First, if the Treasurer implied yesterday that that was crook, that was some form of theft and indefensible for that reason, why on earth was the coalition's own superannuation policy, announced by it, by him, before the election and on a number of occasions subsequently, embracing exactly that same concept of matching compulsory employee contributions? The coalition policy states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Coalition Government will support the introduction of compulsory employee contributions to be phased in from 1997/98 . . .
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That has always been part of the scheme. The coalition has also embraced it. It is a nonsensical point to be now making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the Treasurer knows perfectly well that those employee deductions will go straight into workers' personal superannuation accounts. These deductions will go, without any further tax on the way in, straight towards the financial independence of retired workers. In the super funds, those employee contributions will accumulate at a faster rate than many other forms of saving for retirement due to the investment policies of the funds, tax concessionality for super and lower fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, not only will this money always belong to the workers who earned it and contributed it under our scheme&mdash;and the one endorsed by the government&mdash;but the point is that that money will double in value immediately as a result of the government co-contribution that is part and parcel of this whole scheme. Precisely because of the government's matching contribution&mdash;now sought to be abandoned; now sought to be welshed on by the government&mdash;that will no longer follow. Here we have this alleged outrage over the doubling of the future value of workers' retirement overnight. How unfair. How outrageous that is. How outrageous it is, in fact, for the coalition to be walking away from this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next swiftie we hear is that this will not harm the future retirement benefits of young Australian workers. Let me just repeat the point about that $100,000 package reduction that will be involved for the average worker. Where does the $100,000 figure come from? I put on the record the central case study last August that makes the point. The case is of a worker in his mid&hyphen;30s&mdash;34 years old to be precise&mdash;earning average weekly earnings of around $670 a week. He would retire at 65 years with a super benefit of around $265,000. Without the personal and matching contribution, this worker's final benefit would be around $160,000. That is a difference of not just $100,000 but $105,000. That is what is involved when you tear up this particular scheme.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2900">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next swiftie we hear from the Treasurer smirking away and arrogantly sitting over there is that this scheme is unworkable&mdash;that the Labor thing that the coalition picked up and unequivocally endorsed cannot work in practice. He says that it could never have worked. Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. The simple fact that he is making this point now is because he is utterly embarrassed by the unworkability of his own super surcharge system which has been demonstrated to be an unholy administrative and financial mess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system for administering the co&hyphen;contribution arrangement has the support of the industry which has to comply with it. That is in stark contrast to the industry's reaction to the surcharge collection method. If anyone knows what is achievable, it is that industry. It will not even involve the collection method for the co&hyphen;contribution exercise; it will not even involve the five steps that the Treasurer purported to identify yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The super funds would not need to get the tax file numbers of all their members because they do not have to claim the co&hyphen;contribution for their members. It is paid  automatically to the fund after the member's tax return is assessed. All that is necessary is for the fund to have the name and address of members and the employers name for the fund to pay the amount provided back to them by the tax office to the individual members. It is an absolute nonsense to suggest that this scheme is unworkable. It is very simple and very straightforward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we have the swiftie of the suggestion pool. This is largely sotto voce because the government and the Treasurer know how indefensible this aspect of the exercise is. There is the idea, the notion and the suggestion that the scheme will not in fact do much to benefit national savings. The truth of the matter, and the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) will further develop this point in what he says in this debate, is that, by hacking into super in this way, the government is tearing apart the most effective possible mechanism that any nation could possibly devise for boosting national saving and providing higher retirement incomes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures prepared by the Retirement Incomes Modelling Task Force and the Treasury show that, over the next 10 years, the matching government and employee super contributions will add $100 billion to the national savings pool. Our national saving each year will be boosted by 1.4 per cent of GDP by this measure. That translates into around $8 billion more saving each year within a decade, and the numbers keep building up from there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other super measures implemented by Labor&mdash;award super and the super guarantee&mdash;are estimated to currently boost national saving by about $3&frac14; billion a year. With the employee and matching government contributions kicking in, the combined super initiatives are estimated to boost national savings by over $10 billion a year by the year 2000, just three years away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Things dramatically accelerate from there. By the year 2005, with all these measures kicking in, total savings in the national pool will double from somewhere under $300 billion at the moment to around $600 billion. As I said, by 2020, you are looking at a national savings pool of about $2,000 billion. That is an enormous amount of extra saving to fund investment in Australia and to create jobs without drawing on the savings of foreigners, without driving up the current account deficit and without driving up the foreign debt, the debt that has actually been increasing since this government has been in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming back to where I began, by attacking Labor and its own $4&half; billion superannuation co&hyphen;contribution commitment, this government is acting in a way which will have it remembered for the shame and the stain not just in the current ebb and flow of politics but for decades and generations to come. This is one of the most profoundly irresponsible decisions that has ever been made by any Australian government.

Is there a policy in place that he is actually analysing? No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have said is that we will not be introducing the Labor Party's policy. Well, Labor lost the election&mdash;why would we be introducing the Labor Party's policy? Labor lost the election. If you wanted this policy to have been introduced, you should have won, but you did not. And it is not our task in government to sit around and say, `Well, where are all of Labor's policies? Let's implement them.' That is the one thing we will not be doing&mdash;and for a very obvious reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were to sit around and implement all of Labor's policies, at the next election we would probably meet the same fate as Labor did at the last election. On 2 March 1996 the people voted for a change. Here is an opposition that has actually been trying to say it is some kind of new Labor Party, Keating is dead, we have Keating out of our system, we do not have anything to do with him. And what do they do? They come back in here arguing for the Keating policies. And this is more of a Keating policy than any of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2902"> other policies that we could enumerate in relation to the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this policy has its genesis in the Keating infamous l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w commitment before 1992. You cannot understand modern Australian politics unless you understand the history of the 1993 election. In the 1993 election the coalition went to the Australian people and proposed a goods and services tax. In return for a goods and services tax, we said that we would reduce income tax rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paul Keating, who probably did not think he could win the 1993 election, produced a policy saying that he would match those income tax reductions without the introduction of any GST. He went to the election in 1993 saying that a GST was unnecessary and wrong because he would produce the income tax cuts promised by the opposition without it. And what voter would not go into a ballot box on the promise of being able to have income tax cuts without an increase in indirect tax from one side and a reduction in income tax with an increase in indirect tax from the other side?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Keating not only said that it was a promise to reduce income tax rates; he put it into law, l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w. He legislated it before the election. And I suppose much to his great surprise,  he won that election. And after the 1993 election he said, `And now what do we do with that l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w? What do we do with that legislation?' Those income tax cuts had never been affordable and never were. They sat down, and John Dawkins, who was the Treasurer at the time, decided it would be much more responsible to legislate them out of l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w than to blow the Commonwealth bottom line even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, at that stage we did not have any idea as to  how bad the bottom line would be, because the Labor Party was then engaged in a deliberate attempt to conceal the state of the Australian finances. In the mid&hyphen;year review produced by the Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), shortly before the 1996 election, he said that the Australian accounts were in surplus. In fact, they were $11 billion in deficit, with $10 billion deficits in all of the future years. But Dawkins at least, probably knowing what the real situa
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion was, determined upon a course to get rid of the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts, and he did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, coming to the 1996 election, the Labor Party, obviously stung by the fact that they had legislated tax cuts before an election and taken them away after an election and that this would come back and hang around their necks like a millstone in the course of the 1996 election, said, `Oh, we have got a new idea. We are not just abolishing them; we are not just taking them back. What we will do is pay them in the year 2000.' Forget about the year 1998&hyphen;99. In 1998&hyphen;99 it was one per cent. In 1999&hyphen;2000 it was two per cent and in 2000&hyphen;2001 it was three per cent. That is where you get your $4.5 billion&mdash;in the year 2001&hyphen;2002. So it was $1 billion in 1998&hyphen;99, $2 billion in 1999&hyphen;2000, $4 billion in 2000&hyphen;2001 and $4.5 billion in 2001&hyphen;2002.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Labor Party was now of course in a preposterous position. What had been l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w in 1992 was now on a promise for the year 2001&hyphen;2002. What they had not been able to deliver in one year they were now promising on a delayed lay&hyphen;by basis eight years after the event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we won the election, the first thing we did was sit down and call for the papers as to how the system that had been announced in the 1995 election was going to work. For example, the first thing that would have to be done is that employees would have to pay one per cent of their taxable wages from 1 July 1997 into superannuation, two per cent in 1998, three per cent in 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where were the plans as to how that would actually be implemented? `Oh,' the Labor Party had said, `We will try to get it into awards and buy it out with wage increases.' But where were the wage claims that could have sustained it? What would it have done to wage outcomes, inflation and interest? Oh, that had never been  modelled, that had never been looked at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what would you do in relation to people who were not under industrial awards? How would you possibly get their money? The Labor Party had said, `If necessary, we will legislate.' Well, how would you legislate? You would not be able to legislate a contribution to a third party out of taxable  income
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2903"> under the industrial power. There was only one way in which it could have been done&mdash;by an increase in PAYE taxation. That is, in the name of delivering income tax cuts, in order to make the legislative model you would have had to legislate income tax increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is acknowledged by all of those that had been around in the framing of the 1995 budget&mdash;a budget, I will remind you, that tried to maintain the myth to the Australian public that the accounts were going to balance in that financial year&mdash;what was also clear is that there had been no consideration and certainly no idea at all as to how this could ever be implemented. And I have said that there would be massive logistical problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first, of course, is: how would you get the money out of the employees, except under an income tax increase? That is the biggest problem of all: how would you get it out? Secondly, how would you match up an employee's contribution to make sure it was an after&hyphen;tax contribution against a government payment, except by matching individually all taxpayers in the work force, because you had to match it amount for amount? The third problem is: what happens if you start making co&hyphen;contributions or even employee contributions into defined benefit schemes? How would that possibly work? The fourth problem is, as everybody said: why was it that the benefits were being skewed to middle and higher income earners? The Keating answer to that was that they were the ones that were going to get the value of the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth problem was: what about people who are outside the work force? If you got to 54, you got a contribution for one year and then it ceased? Was that the way in which it was going to operate? All of these questions met wry chuckles when one asked how all these problems were going to be met. You would look at them and you would say, `Surely this had all been contemplated.' Nothing had been contemplated. Nothing had been put in place, and it could not have been workable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You come in here and say, `Oh, well, ASFA says that they would have been quite happy to make it work.' Of course ASFA
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would have been quite happy to make it work because they wanted the money. I have never seen an opposition run by an interest group in the way this opposition is run by the ASFA. The ASFA does have a lot of industry funds and they have a lot of trade union representation on them, but they are not all trade union funds. You do not have to take your orders from ASFA because only a part of ASFA is the trade union movement. But you come in here in relation to this amount and you say uncritically, `ASFA said it could work.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who do you think was going to get their hands on the money? What do you think happens in these superannuation funds? It is not just administration costs. Have you ever heard of fund managers? If you are talking about $600 billion under management with fund managers taking one or two per cent, have you any idea of the money that is being made in this industry? What is more, it is a unique industry. This is an industry where by law they get income. These people do not have to go out like a bank or a share trader and say, `Come to me; I have a good product.' This is an industry where you have legislated a steady stream of income which goes into management and is under commission. This is a guaranteed legislative income operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You come in here and say, `The ASFA would have been quite happy to make work an extra three per cent legislated income plus a three per cent government income.' Of course they would have. There would be no person in Australia who would look back and complain if you gave them six per cent of income in Australia which they managed for a profit under funds management on commission. Who would complain about it? It is one of the richest industries that has been set up in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said that we will not be introducing this scheme. You do not know what we will be introducing, but it will be guided by all of the things that I have said before. It will be guided by fairness, it will be particularly directed to ensure that there is more fairness for the lower income earner, because you were skewing benefits to middle and higher income earners, and it will give more flexi

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer (Mr Costello) says that we are doing this because there is nothing else we could raise, it is of no significance and our heart is not in it. Let me repudiate all of those comments at the outset. There is great significance in this issue, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) has said. Our hearts are very much in it. This is an enormously significant issue for this parliament and for this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government is doing is ratting on the most important savings scheme that this country has ever seen. Indeed, there is probably nowhere in the Western world that has had a savings scheme of this significance, and it is being destroyed by a government which promised to introduce it. This is another broken promise by a lousy government which continually breaks promises, especially this Treasurer, who has broken promise after promise on taxation: no new taxes, no increases in any tax. He has broken that umpteen times and now breaks another one, the biggest of all, because his party promised to introduce this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just Labor's measure; you endorsed it. You said it was your policy. Don't sit there and say, `This is Labor's; it has nothing to do with us.' It has everything to do with you because you said it was your policy. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has read quotes which show that that is unambiguously the case. Let me just add to them. In the superannuation policy issued last February, they issued a comparison of Labor's policy and their policy. It said on employee contributions to superannuation, `The Labor policy is phased introduction of up to three per cent of employee contributions through enterprise agreements and awards. Our policy: no change.' And yet you stand here and say it was not your policy. It was absolutely a policy you told the Australian people was your policy. And now you are squibbing and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ratting on it once again, as you have on so many other policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it came to the government co&hyphen;contribution, the $4&half; billion, what did they say about that? They said, `The coalition will meet the government's co&hyphen;contribution commitment.' That was their promise, which they are now walking away from. It is an outrage that they can stand up here and say, `It was never our policy'&mdash;hand on the heart as though we should believe them. How can you believe anyone who walks away from such unambiguous comments as that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, they always had a few slippery slide words and they said, `We reserve the right to vary the delivery mechanism to provide the most effective and equitable payment system.' They never said what that meant. But it certainly does not take away from the fact that they promised to introduce the co&hyphen;contribution&mdash;to pay it. And they are not doing it. This is an outrageous step by this government, from whom nothing surprises you any more. But I am amazed that they can be so blase about something of such enormous significance to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They say that this system would not work. There is absolutely no reason to believe that, because the fact is that this system would work. It would work because all it requires is for the awards to be changed. The unions had agreed to that. Do you think the commission was not going to agree to changing the awards or that the employers would object? Of course not. Once the awards had changed, the employer deducted the contribution of the employee as per the award, paid it to the ATO and that was shown on the group certificate. The employee sent the group certificate to the Taxation Office as normal, they saw the amount of payment by the employer for his super and they paid the matching co&hyphen;contribution, depending on his income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is relatively simple. It is absurd to say that this is something that could not be introduced. Indeed, the then opposition said that they would legislate in respect of this. They said that employee contributions may be legislated depending on how implementation progresses. In other words, if awards are not good enough, they will legislate to make sure
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2905"> it happens. They were going beyond our policy, yet now they are saying that they will not do any of it. He is also saying that legislation would not work, having promised that he would do it, if necessary, before the last election. This is a total abandonment of any credibility that was ever left with this Treasurer. There is a total loss of credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer also said yesterday that the Public Service did not know how to implement this. That is absolute rubbish. The fact is that the Treasurer was involved in the development of this and the officer, the key person, most involved in developing this is a person regarded by this government as of such importance that he is the secretary to the Wallis inquiry. If he is such an idiot, if he is such a fool that he produces an unworkable scheme, why did you appoint him to such an important job? Why did you give him a position of such great significance if he is such a complete fool to produce an unworkable policy? Obviously, he is not. He is an extremely well credentialled officer who is respected by all who know him. The policy that was produced is a workable policy. It is complete obfuscation to say that this is an unworkable policy when trying to develop some excuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that what is happening here is quite deplorable. The broken promise point has been made, so with time disappearing I will quickly move on from that. It is incredible that we continue to see these broken promises. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said, this ruins a very good retirement incomes policy which gave workers the prospect, in the 21st century, that they could retire on their full incomes&mdash;that is, on average weekly earnings or below. It will take years to develop for someone who goes into the work force at the beginning of the next century and spends their working life paying these contributions, but at the end of it they would walk away with their wages as their retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not having that means, in terms of a lump sum in today's money, a loss of $200,000 in real benefits. To say that there is no loss to people is just absurd. There is an enormous loss in retirement income. As the Deputy
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Leader of the Opposition said, with the ageing of the population it is doubly extraordinary that the government can just abandon a scheme of this order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This country needs to have an important savings scheme. We all know that one of the key points of this scheme was to improve national savings. Why do we want national savings improved? We want to reduce the savings investment gap so that we can get the current account deficit down and have that lifted further off our shoulders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is obviously agreement around the parliament that we should have a better savings effort. The question is: how do you get there? Here was a savings scheme which was going to provide a tremendous long-term boost to savings. All the figures were given by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; I will not go over them. The government are throwing all that away. It is extraordinary that they could be so blase as to throw away something of such crucial importance to the future. They say, `We will have another scheme, which we will announce in the budget.' That scheme will not have compulsory contributions by employees. Therefore that element of the savings boost will not be there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is not for retirement purposes but is some sort of a working life savings vehicle, whereby one can be in it for several years then access it, you will get enormous leakage of the savings. This is nothing like a savings scheme that superannuation provides. So you do not get that boost to savings, you do not get that improvement to the national economy in the medium&hyphen; and long-term that this scheme was going to give. To abandon it is total economic irresponsibility and represents ideology gone crazy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does that sit with the budgetary policy? We have seen swingeing cuts in so many areas. We have seen the slashing of labour market programs, of higher education, of small but important areas like legal aid. We have seen tremendous cuts and pain inflicted all over the country and we have had all the broken promises on tax. What is that said to be for? Because we need to boost the national savings. Yet whilst you are doing all  that&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2906">creating all this pain, breaking all your promises to boost national savings&mdash;you are destroying a program which is there to boost national savings. It just does not make any sense whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I can see, this is the most outrageously stupid decision that any government has made in the history of this country. It is a total and direct breach of promise to the Australian people. In a few weeks time this Treasurer will stand up in this parliament and say that he needs to do more things&mdash;to inflict more pain, make more cuts and increase taxes to increase national savings. Yet he is here today saying, `There is no need for this scheme because it would not have worked anyway and we don't care about national savings through superannuation.' He says that he has got this other vehicle, which presumably he will announce at the time of the budget, but it will not have anything like the impact of the previous scheme. This issue is a matter of tremendous importance to the Australian people and it is tremendously important that this issue has been raised in the parliament today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand why the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has got so excited over this issue. It was the member for Gellibrand who introduced this policy idea in 1995 called `saving for our future'. One of the most important things that we have to remember about this subject is that this policy that the opposition today have raised as an MPI is their policy. It was this side of the House that was voted in in March 1996. We do not have to accept the policy that they laid down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at it in detail. Let me go back to superannuation. I believe that superannuation is one of the most important vehicles that we have in this country to not only increase national savings but also to give individuals the opportunity to contribute to their own future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other day in this place I rose to talk about a similar matter, the superannuation surcharge. One of the greatest ways to ensure that people make a contribution towards their future is to make sure that they make a commitment, and a major commitment, in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their own right. When we look at the superannuation system prior to 1983 we see that the incentive for people to make a contribution was to get taxation benefits by doing so. But the most important thing that happened was that people made a contribution of at least 50 per cent in savings for their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this proposal that was brought in in 1995 that the opposition is saying the government must adopt, we can see that, since the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy in 1983, the employer contribution has been climbing towards nine per cent. The co&hyphen;payment system as introduced by the now opposition in the 1995 budget involves the employee building up to a total of three per cent. The co&hyphen;payment contribution means that the government, the taxpayers of this country, will put in another three per cent. Where is the equality in that? At the end of the day we are looking at 12 per cent from the employer and the government, and three per cent from the employee&mdash;not a bad little system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But where is the incentive for the employee to make that contribution and to make a decision about providing for their future from their own income? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) talked about the pyramid. It is true that, back in the 1960s and the 1970s, the ageing population narrowed to a very high peak in the pyramid. That is flattening out today. But we have to look at it very seriously and very conscientiously to see who is going to pay at the end of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure it is the average taxpayer who will also be the recipient of co&hyphen;payment superannuation. So, for the government to make a contribution in the form of a co&hyphen;payment to a funded scheme, it means the government has to find the three per cent. Where will they find the three per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, we have heard a lot in this place about unfunded schemes. The current government scheme for the bureaucracy is unfunded. It does not need to be funded, but this proposal is to fund it. So where will the funds be found? Obviously it will have to be funded from revenue. If it is going to be funded from revenue, there are
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2907"> two choices: cut services or raise taxes. Is that what the opposition is seriously saying to us?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, we have to help people for the future, but we have to look at how we go about it in a very serious way. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it appears that the way the opposition is heading towards actually delivering this co&hyphen;payment is very much in the dark. While they thought up a good scheme, where is the detail on how they are going to deliver it? I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it will put pressure on wages and it will put costs onto jobs because somebody else is trying to find the money. I think that is the basic flaw in the opposition's argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we did not break any promise. The promise was made by the opposition in 1995. I can understand that the member for Gellibrand is very upset; it is obviously a proposal he passionately wants to get forward. Now he is looking for somebody else to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the administration of it. In the last couple of days in this place in relation to the superannuation surcharge, we have heard that there will be enormous expense involved in administering it. We are talking about four per cent of employees in this country who are likely to be paying the superannuation surcharge. In co&hyphen;funded superannuation, we are looking at 94 per cent of workers in this country paying three per cent. Who will have to administer it? It will have to be administered by the government and by employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the government side. They are going to make a contribution. First of all, they will have to make an individual contribution in some form to every worker in that 94 per cent of employees in Australia. Is that going to cost twopence? Will that cost a few cents? How many millions of dollars will it cost?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What extra cost is going to be added to the taxpayers of this country to enable this to be administered and delivered? When would it be delivered? Is it going to be delivered per pay packet? Is it going to be delivered per month? Is it going to be delivered per quarter? Is it going to be delivered, as I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans)
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said, possibly once a year at taxation time? How is that going to take place and what is the cost of delivery&mdash;that three per cent co&hyphen;contribution? How many millions is that going to add to the budget every year to be able to deliver this and what difference is it going to make to the outcomes and the benefits that are going to come to the recipients?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's look at one type of scheme: a defined benefits scheme. A defined benefits scheme does not require an employer to contribute, so long as there is an audited amount remaining in the scheme that will guarantee the payout for all the employees. If a defined benefits scheme has the amount, is the government, as a co&hyphen;payment, going to be liable to continue paying even though it is not required to pay under the rules of a defined benefits scheme? These details have not been clearly displayed and I believe the opposition today certainly have not displayed their case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill has the specific purpose of establishing administrative procedures to support the implementation of income testing arrangements that have been deemed necessary by this government as part of its changes to aged care. However, its provisions can only be properly understood in the full context of  those changes to aged care which were an
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2908"> nounced by the government in the last budget. These changes are primarily contained in the Aged Care Bill 1997, which the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) informed us in her second reading speech will also be introduced in this sitting and which will supersede the bill currently under debate once it is passed. This bill is inextricably entwined with the provisions of the Aged Care Bill, which I understand from the minister will be introduced this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party is opposed to the proposals contained in this Aged Care Income Testing Bill 1997, just as it is implacably opposed to the proposals contained in the major Aged Care Bill. That, of course, is not to say that we are opposed to measures to upgrade nursing homes. The history of Labor in government was one of continuous, positive reform and upgrade of care for older Australians. We have seen the minister rant and rail on this point, but she should just go and talk to any one of the many people involved in the aged care sector and they will certainly tell her otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are opposed to the bill because it seems to us, just as it seems to a large number of people and organisations concerned with the wellbeing of older Australians, to be about the most inappropriate way of going about this task of financing aged care. It is inappropriate because both bills&mdash;the bill that is under debate today and the Aged Care Bill proper that we will see later in the week&mdash;will have serious adverse consequences for older Australians needing nursing home care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our opposition to this bill, as with the Aged Care Bill 1997, is based on two fundamental points. The first is that the Australian Labor Party believes that quality health care and quality nursing home care should be available equally to all Australians on the basis of need. Secondly, we believe that this government's changes to aged care amount to a blatant and cynical abdication of government responsibility that will impact most heavily on the vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) did promise that, whatever measures his government felt compelled to take, one group that would not suffer would be the most vulnera
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ble. Older Australians in nursing homes fit into that category. But those older Australians will, as a result of these changes, be left to conclude that when it comes to the Prime Minister's promises, as the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) so eloquently just put, their welfare was never a core promise and, therefore, is of no concern to this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Aged Care Income Testing Bill 1997 allows the Department of Social Security to collect information about the income of nursing home or hostel residents, including those who are not pensioners, in anticipation of the introduction and passage of the Aged Care Bill 1997. This information will be used to calculate how much of a daily fee of up to $64 a resident will be required to pay from 1 July this year. This income testing bill is the first step towards the introduction of user charging in nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the opposition I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> deplores the government's decision to charge a daily fee for nursing home residents which will ultimately lead to the creation of an `economy, business and first class' system of nursing home care; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is of the opinion that as well as enshrining a flawed and unjust policy, the Bill fails to:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provide that all determinations should be appealable through the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or the Veterans' Review Board to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">While we oppose the bill and will be voting against it, the government could at least consider this serious amendment. Part (1) of this second reading amendment deplores the charges in nursing homes because of the disastrous effect they will have on access to nursing home care and to the various stand
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2909"> ards of care that will depend on how much people have to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the amendment, part (2)(a), is necessary because a large number of nursing home residents require the assistance of a third party acting on their behalf in business dealings. More than 60 per cent of people admitted to nursing homes come from public hospitals or other acute hospitals after experiencing major illness or injury. This amendment simply acknowledges their right to have a competent person look out for their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part (2)(b) changes the emphasis of this clause from one of presumed guilt to one of presumed innocence. As it is currently drafted, this clause means that if the secretary does nothing about reviewing a determination for 90 days after a review has been asked for, then the determination is confirmed. The amendment reverses this so that if no action is taken for 90 days then the secretary is taken to have decided in the person's favour. Given the amount of restructuring that is going on in the Department of Social Security&mdash;forced by this government&mdash;such a reversal of emphasis seems not just fair but a matter of natural justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see the minister at the table and will remind her that this is the second time that we have had to move such an amendment. I acknowledge that the first time, in relation to child&hyphen;care legislation, she accepted the opposition's amendment. It is very important that we do not have legislation that allows government officials to sit on decisions and then to find in favour of the bureaucracy rather than to find in favour of the older person as this bill does. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is Labor's view that the changes embodied in this bill, and the changes we expect to see in the Aged Care Bill to be introduced later in the week will be a disaster for aged care in this country. It seems to be the view of everybody involved in the industry that implementation is going to be chaotic because the time involved is just too short.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The central fund raising proposal, too, is that people needing nursing home care have to sell their homes to pay an entry fee. It is not just unfair, it is callous and insensitive in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its effect on older Australians. In my view, it is also unfair that the first generation of entry fee payers will most certainly receive no benefit from their fees, given the time that capital improvements usually take and the time that people generally stay in nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will, of course, facilitate the charging of an additional daily fee of 25c in the dollar of private income earned above the pension&hyphen;free area of $98 a fortnight for single people. There are two important issues to be raised about the effect of this new daily charge. The first is the effect that it has on the marginal tax rate of retired Australians. Whether they are pensioners, part&hyphen;pensioners or self&hyphen;funded retirees they will have to pay this additional fee. Figures supplied by researchers in the Parliamentary Library show that a pensioner with $10,000 of additional income above the pension&mdash;that might arise out of superannuation&mdash;will pay an effective marginal tax rate of 94 per cent as a result of the additional fee that this bill will see them pay. Ninety&hyphen;four per cent! Who else has to pay this sort of effective marginal tax rate? It is an outrage that these sort of tax rates will apply to people in nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fees will also cause large reductions in the personal disposable income of residents. This issue becomes of increasing importance as nursing homes and hostels detail the services that they will determine will be fee&hyphen;bearing extras. Things like clothes, fruit, fruit juice, soap, shampoo, and even toilet paper, we fear, will come into these categories. The bill also opens the way for the fee to increase beyond its current level of 25c in the dollar, with all the additional hardships that that fee will bring for nursing home residents. It is hard to imagine that the fee will just stay at that level and I know that many involved in the nursing home sector have already raised this concern with the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will it go higher? Will this government, at some future date, feel the temptation, just as we now see with the increases in the Medicare levy? Will we see the government increase this fee by 30c or 35c in the dollar? The minister must, if she will not throw all the other mad ideas out in this bill, particular
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2910"> ly in the Aged Care Bill, give a guarantee on behalf of the government that the fee will at least be pegged at its current level. Failure to give that guarantee would be tantamount to foreshadowing fee increases in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern with the fee is that not only will it increase but also variable fees will be linked to variable standards of care. We will see different nursing homes&mdash;in fact, as the Aged Care Bill envisages, different wings in the same home&mdash;offering different levels of care to residents. The way it has been put to me by one nursing home resident is that some will get orange juice, some will get orange cordial and a few will only get water. While this might sound a trite example, it does represent the thin end of the wedge that will very quickly drive up the cost of aged care. Just as we have seen in other areas of the health sector of the United States, if fees are allowed to become variable and rise unchecked at the top end, the result inevitably is upwardly spiralling health care costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is also an example of callous cost shifting from a shared cost, undertaken by everybody in the community through the public system, to an onerous discriminatory charge on those who unfortunately do need to go into nursing homes. Let us remember that it is only a very small number of people that this applies to. It is only three per cent of the population over the age of 70 who will ever need to be admitted to a nursing home. Such a shift from the public purse to the private purses of those who need nursing home care will be hard enough on those who have assets such as a family home. But, of course, it will be much more serious for those without income or savings because it is they who will miss out on access to nursing home care or will receive a very second-rate standard of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second concern I have is about the way the new fee calculations are affected by the level of the entry fee charged when the resident enters the nursing home. That is the way in which these two fees are intimately linked. Residents who pay nursing homes an entry fee in excess of $88,500, to be indexed, will not be eligible for the pensioner supplement payment. This means that those residents
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will have to pay a higher base fee of $26.40 a day. Per fortnight, this is $421.80, which is higher than the value of the full pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Residents in such homes would need to have income from other investments of at least $21.80 per fortnight just to meet the higher daily base fee. Then there is still the matter of the extra income to purchase the items that, in my view, will no longer be supplied by the home. The inevitable result of this requirement to pay a higher daily base fee is likely to prevent many pensioners accessing homes charging these very high entry contributions of over $88,500. We are already hearing spokespeople for the industry saying that fees of $100,000 or $150,000 will be charged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point to consider is the effect on pension entitlements for those people who are forced to sell their homes to pay the entry fee. For those with money left over from the sale of their home after paying the entry fee, this money will be deemed by the Department of Social Security to earn a minimum of four per cent per annum on the first $30,000 and six per cent on amounts above this. This will obviously affect the level of pension paid to the resident and their liability and capacity to pay the daily fees to be tested under this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to work through a couple of examples to illustrate the impact on part&hyphen;pensioners in particular, as I believe these people are likely to be especially disadvantaged by this legislation. The examples are based on current Sydney house prices and assume that in both examples we are talking about single part&hyphen;pensioners with superannuation assets of $150,000, meaning that after the assets test a part&hyphen;pension of $235.26 is received. The examples assume an entry fee of $90,000 and $10,000 in transaction costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first example: a three&hyphen;bedroom home in Strathfield sold for $344,000. In this instance, the person going into the nursing home would have to pay the higher daily fee of $26.40 plus, as a result of this bill, the Department of Social Security would assess them as being liable to pay an extra daily fee of $9.93. Most importantly, because the home was sold and generated extra assets, this
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2911"> person would fail  the asset test and would lose their part&hyphen;pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second example: a three&hyphen;bedroom cottage in Erskineville sold for $350,000. In this example, after paying the entry fee, they would also have to pay the higher daily fee of $26.40, plus in this case they would be assessed by the Department of Social Security as having to pay an extra daily fee of $14.28. As with the first example, this person would lose their part&hyphen;pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In both of these examples, the person going into the nursing home would have to invest the balance of the home sale price so that that money plus their superannuation benefit would provide an income stream to pay the additional daily fee and also to give them money for the extras like medications&mdash;not something that I would consider an extra&mdash;fruit, toiletries and all the other things. We see from the document which the opposition released a couple of weeks ago that this government intends taking away the tax break for nursing home residents to help them pay for these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the resident would have an increased tax liability as a result of the extra money invested. These are very, very serious changes that are going to impact on people who are very vulnerable and who at this stage have no idea that this will be the impact on their part&hyphen;pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern that has been voiced is that the investment return may not cover the increased tax liability plus the extra and higher daily charges and the loss of the part&hyphen;pension. It is felt that residents will be obliged to dip into the capital from the sale of their home&mdash;the capital that might be left after paying the entry contributions&mdash;to pay for these additional costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two other points that are most likely to cause concern for part&hyphen;pensioners and for self-funded retirees as a result of this bill. One is, of course, that they will increasingly have to come to rely on the advice of financial advisers. The second is that they will come under close and detailed scrutiny by the Department of Social Security&mdash;the first time for many self-funded retirees.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An issue of great concern that was raised with me on Friday is whether or not people who are in the know will in fact pay the full value of their home to a nursing home to avoid the tax impact, the assets test and income test impact and the additional daily fee impact&mdash;all of these additional fees that the government is introducing. One way that nursing homes are thinking about getting around this with their residents is having the whole value of the home paid over as an entry fee. I understand the Department of Social Security has cottoned onto this problem, and it would be very helpful if the minister could outline in her response later this evening how this loophole will be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are further concerned about is something that will be available to wealthy people but not to lower and middle income people&mdash;the trend of putting the ownership of people's homes into trusts. People will still live in their homes but not own their homes, so the homes will not be assessed for the purposes of entry fees and they will not be seen to have money to pay these additional daily fees&mdash;yet another loophole that we hope will be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another fundamental reason for our opposition to this bill is the blatant dishonesty it represents. In her second reading speech, the minister talked about `the level of charges that they'&mdash;that is, the older Australians needing nursing home care&mdash;`will face when the aged care bill is passed.' If the government were honest about that, we would have the true word used. This of course is yet another tax. Just like the superannuation surcharge that was debated last night, we are today debating yet another introduction of a tax in this place, a tax from a government that promised no new taxes. Yet another broken promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have just heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) and the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) outline one of the biggest broken promises so far as superannuation is concerned. Now we have another example where the government is introducing what it calls in this bill&mdash;and what it will call in the Aged Care Bill to  come&mdash;fees or accommodation bonds. These
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2912"> are all the new words that have been invented: surcharges, bonds, charges, fees. These are all the new words that really spell `tax'. Certainly, older Australians know it is a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A great concern to the proprietors of aged care facilities is the fact that this government is proposing to turn nursing home proprietors into tax collectors, because it is these nursing home proprietors who will be collecting the fees from the residents. I would like to quote by way of example the views of the hostel operator of Brisbane Water (NSW). The chief executive officer of that hostel says the following about the collection of income tested user contributions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Brisbane Water (NSW) Legacy does not support the proposal that service providers collect the income&hyphen;tested user contributions from residents. The time delays, circumstances surrounding many admissions (especially to nursing homes),&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">a point the minister still has not acknowledged&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the additional complexities relating to direct collection of monies resulting from an income test could be avoided if the Government was to reduce pensions by the amount of the income&hyphen;tested user charge at source.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But that would require the government to come to terms with the fact that they are introducing a new tax. The operator goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless this recommendation is accepted, we would expect the Government to accept full responsibility for the collection of debts arising from non-payment of income&hyphen;tested user contributions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless these matters are satisfactorily resolved, we are concerned the quality of aged care for residents on the Central Coast . . . of New South Wales will almost certainly deteriorate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That represents very much the views of older people in this country. What this legislation represents is yet another example of the government taking more and more out of the pockets of older and sicker people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish my comments by reiterating the first part of the second reading amendment that we have moved to this bill. We do deplore the introduction of these new nursing home fees. They will mean the introduction of an economy, business and first-class system to our nursing home care sector, something
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is to be deplored in Australia and something that we will certainly argue strongly against and vote against in this House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me start by congratulating the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) on her economy. By writing this speech, she has managed to avoid writing a new speech when the next Aged Care Bill comes up. She has floated all around the place today covering every aspect of aged care&mdash;here, there, accommodation bonds&mdash;and wandered totally off the legislation, which, as she briefly pointed out in the beginning, is to facilitate the administration of the legislation that will come in in July this year. That will let people know what they will be expected to pay in the user pays system of the nursing homes. This legislation allows an assessment of that income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us pick up that line, shall we, that the member for Jagajaga referred to. The user pays system, she said, as if it was some sort of dirty word. Can we have a look at what was happening under the Labor government? The present cost of residential nursing home care is $2.1 billion. That is an awful lot of money that this country cannot afford, especially in light of the debt the Labor government left this country. Nursing homes cost $2.1 billion. The government is paying most of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Up till now, we have asked people who can afford it to pay 87&half; per cent of the pension. What is that equivalent to? $184. What is the cost of a nursing home bed per week? $630. That is a lot of difference. It costs $630 per week and we are asking people to pay $184. The pension covers that and, for those who do not get the pension and who have independent means, they pay that out. But there is the gap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you about a situation that existed in one of the aged care facilities in my electorate. We will call the gentleman Mr C, for obvious reasons&mdash;so as  not to identify him. Mr C had a condition where he was in this nursing home for 10
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2913"> years. He paid $184 per week to be in that nursing home. The taxpayers of Australia paid the remaining $446. They subsidised Mr C in the nursing home by $446 a week. Who was it who was paying the taxes? It was the families out there; the battlers, the families with small kids who had to pay their taxes to make up that $446 a week Mr C was not paying as part of his accommodation cost in the nursing home.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MARTIN" NAMEID="8I4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr Martin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was he a pensioner?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CU4">Mrs GALLUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, he was not. This is the whole point; he was not a pensioner. And when he died he left $8 million to his children. So while the battlers out there, the men and women with small kids, were fighting to pay their taxes to pay the nursing home bills of Mr C, paying $446 per week to keep Mr C in the nursing home, his children accumulated $8 million, which they got when he died. Where is the justice in that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was the system that the Labor Party perpetuated. It did not matter whether you could afford to pay your own way; you could go into a nursing home and the poor suckers out there who were paying taxes would keep you, so when you died all the funds that you had accumulated while you were in the nursing home would go to your children. Where is the justice in that? What sort of Labor Party asks the poor people in the country to pay taxes to pay for those who can afford the cost of living in nursing homes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga says with contempt, `This looks like a user pays system.' Yes, it is a user pays system. It is about time it became a user pays system because, frankly, we cannot afford in this country to have anything else. We cannot afford for the government to be subsidising people who can afford it to the tune of $446 a week in nursing homes. It is simply not possible. Yet the member for Jagajaga, on behalf of the opposition, comes into this place and says, `We oppose the income testing aspect of this legislation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, she is saying to the people of Australia, the people who are fighting to pay their taxes, some of whom are giving up on basic necessities of life just to survive and bring up their kids the way they want to, `We
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> want you to continue to pay for the wealthy when they go into nursing homes.' When the member for Jagajaga, on her salary, finally ends up in a nursing home&mdash;as perhaps we all might&mdash;she does not want to pay for her own fees; she wants the people out there who are on salaries of a half, a third, a quarter of what she is getting, to pay for her to live in a nursing home. If that is Labor's policy, it tells us a lot about what the Labor Party stands for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga, in her rather discursive speech that went right across the whole gamut of aged care and way away from this legislation, touched on the history of the Labor Party. I did not quite get the exact quote but it went something like this: `The history of the Labor Party is the history of upgrading nursing homes and of quality care.' This is what the member for Jagajaga said. As she introduced this into the debate, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to address those remarks of the member for Jagajaga, because maybe she did not see the 1994 Gregory report on nursing homes under this Labor government, this report which showed the absolute disgrace of what was going on in the nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take a minute to say what I found when first elected to this House. As the then member for Hawker, I took up my responsibilities and went around the nursing homes in my electorate. What I found was that there were some extraordinarily good nursing homes, some absolutely fantastic nursing homes, where the residents had first&hyphen;class care and first&hyphen;class facilities. But I also found places where I would not want a dog to live. I found places where there were six to eight people stuck in a room, rooms without windows, with absolutely no privacy at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I walked into one nursing home and a woman grabbed me and started babbling to me. I did not know what she was saying. It turned out she was Thai and could not speak English and she had not one person in that home to talk to&mdash;not one. The nursing staff said, `Don't mind her; she tries to grab everyone to see whether somebody will speak  Thai to her.' And there was no&hyphen;one and there never had been anyone. In another nursing
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2914"> home the only place out of the wards where they were not stuck with six people in a room was a corridor; and there they were, lined up in the corridor, in front of one television set. And this was the standard of nursing home care of the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The standard of some of the buildings was appalling. The Gregory report said that 70 per cent of the homes needed upgrading at a cost, simply of the buildings, of half a billion dollars&mdash;$521 million, simply to bring up the buildings to health and fire standards. That is what had happened under the Labor government&mdash;the standards had dropped. Yet the member for Jagajaga dares to come into this place and question the need for an accommodation bond. It is those accommodation bonds that are going to allow nursing homes to change what was an absolutely disgraceful situation, a situation where 39 per cent of the residents were in rooms with four or more beds per room. How could the Labor Party live with that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Gregory report looked at the Australian design standards. Let me read some of the faults which it found in nursing homes, which, without accommodation bonds, did not have sufficient funds to upgrade their buildings. Amongst the main faults found were: small or insufficient bathrooms or toilet facilities and lack of lever taps and shower seats. There were no shower seats! This was the standard of nursing home care under what is now the opposition&mdash;the then Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The list of faults continues. There were narrow corridors&mdash;I have told the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) how I saw people in those corridors watching television. There were small rooms, inadequate ramps and lack of wheelchair access and there were multi&hyphen;storey homes without lifts. How were the residents going to get out if there was a fire? Remember, one of the big problems with the homes was that they did not have sufficient fire standards. And yet they had multi&hyphen;stories and no lifts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the outcome standards that this opposition&mdash;the then Labor government&mdash;lived through and was satisfied with. The member for Jagajaga said, `We had a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> great reputation. We are happy with what we did in nursing home care.' The report says there were toilets not large enough to allow assistance for residents with frames or wheelchairs. How do you think they got in? They had a frame or a wheelchair, and they could not get into the toilets in their own nursing homes. I presume the nursing staff had to physically lift them off their chair and carry them into the lavatory. How demeaning was that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report goes on to list: too few toilets; inadequate access to basins for residents and wheelchairs; small rooms; multi&hyphen;storey buildings with&mdash;again&mdash;no lifts; inadequate heating and cooling, so in summer they were too hot and in winter too cold; and rooms with no external windows. You have to remember that a lot of people in nursing homes cannot move out of their rooms. Those rooms are where they spend their lives&mdash;yet they were spending them with no privacy and in rooms without any windows. This was the standard of care that the member for Jagajaga says the Labor Party was so proud of. She said, `We did not need accommodation bonds'; what does the Gregory report say other than, `For heavens sake, put more money into nursing home care'? Accommodation bonds are certainly one of the ways to go about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under fire authority orders the report lists lack of fire doors, smoke fire detectors and a fire main. Under health authority orders it lists inadequate laundry and kitchen facilities and inadequate pan rooms. A number of homes are described where the dirty laundry and the food were delivered through the same chutes. This was the system of nursing home care that the member for Jagajaga said the previous government was so proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga has made a lot of noise today. She has said&mdash;the absolute horror&mdash;`Some people might have to sell their homes', and she has cried crocodile tears. But wasn't this the Labor Party's policy? Didn't the Labor Party set up a system where people going into hostels sold their home to pay an accommodation bond? When I go round to hostels and ask what happens, they say,  `People sell their homes as they come into the hostel.' That was a Labor Party system. If it
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2915"> was such a great system for hostels under the Labor Party, how come suddenly it is such a bad system for nursing homes under the coalition? This is so typical of this opposition&mdash;it is totally and utterly hypocritical. This opposition brought down tariffs but now has an anti&hyphen;tariff policy. This opposition brought in accommodation bonds for hostels and is now opposed to them in nursing homes. Has this opposition no integrity at all? It is totally hypocritical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go one step further, you find that&mdash;under the present system set up by Labor&mdash;when people move into nursing homes they end up selling their homes anyway. Under their rules, social security may deem the home as part of the assets of the person for pension calculation after they have been in a nursing home for two years. That means that people lose part of their pension and, to pay what they have to pay, they sell their homes. That is exactly what happens now. People sell their homes to go into nursing homes, because, if they do not, they cannot get enough money because their pension is reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But people sell their homes anyway. If I moved to Sydney tomorrow, I would not expect to keep my home in Adelaide. I would expect to sell it to pay to move into Sydney. Why should it be any different when I move into a nursing home? Why should I keep my expensive home out there, costing $100,000 or $200,000, so that the taxpayer can keep me? Surely, if I move into a nursing home&mdash;just as if I move to Sydney&mdash;it is appropriate that I give up my home; unless what I really want to do is keep all my assets in one place so my children can inherit it all. My children would like that. My children would say, `Please mum, don't sell up the home&mdash;we want it.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a pleasure to follow the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) in the debate today, because she clearly does have a particular point of view to put. I always find it interesting to listen to members like the member for Hindmarsh because she has an electorate, she has travelled around Australia and she has obviously taken a keen interest in the whole issue of aged care. I say this in a very genuine sense. I do, however&mdash;and she will not find this strange&mdash;think that a couple of the points that she has made distinguish both sides of this parliament from each other in respect to aged care policy and, specifically, nursing homes. I will make a couple of comments about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my contribution, I particularly want to&mdash;and I am delighted the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) is here&mdash;make some comments on veterans and war widows because there are, as is indicated in the second reading speech, special protections for war widows and widowers built into the bill so that they will not pay any more than other people with an equivalent income. I think that is an important concession and one which needs some comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think, first and foremost, the point that needs to be made here is that as you travel around Australia and as you go to nursing homes or hostels, you will see variations in the quality of the care being provided. It simply is a fact of life that some are Rolls Royce type of operations and some have standards which we would all like to see improved. There is no doubt about that. Equally, as the member for Hindmarsh rightly pointed out, it is the financial imperative which normally is the basis for whether or not some of those nursing homes can be improved. That, I think, was the basis of her argument&mdash;that user pays&mdash;and accommodation bonds is one way in which that will be improved, certainly in the case of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Again, a difference in emphasis appears between the government and the opposition in respect of where those funds should come from. I accept that the member for Hindmarsh, by taking her cue as she did from the Gregory report, was able to point to some
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inadequacies in the standards and the quality of care that are provided in some of these establishments. All right, I think it is fair to say that the then government, the now opposition, must wear some of the blame perhaps for not taking a greater interest in, or not making provision for, some of those improvements&mdash;perhaps not looking at world best practice in terms of the delivery of care in some of those nursing homes. But it is a little unfair to say that the Labor Party did not care for those people. That simply is not the case&mdash;and I do not think she really believes that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that all of us in this place, whether we happen to be in government or in opposition, are concerned about aged care. The delivery of quality aged care that has measurable standards applied to it is something that we are all pursuing. It is just the mechanism, perhaps, of getting there is something that we disagree agree on. We would suggest that a government's role is a little larger than what the member for Hindmarsh and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) would want. They believe that user pays is an appropriate principle that can apply here. They believe that there is a need to move with respect to that and to try to, in some way, equate hostels with nursing home care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make these basic points. First and foremost, an issue which the minister likes to run occasionally is where she equates hostels and nursing homes. They simply are not the same. People make a choice in their later life whether they want to live in their own private home&mdash;whether they own it or rent it&mdash;or whether they perhaps want to go into some sort of a hostel, for want of a better term, which is an embracing term that might cover units where there are self&hyphen;care facilities provided for them, and they do sell the family home to do that. They are quite happy to do that. As time goes by, perhaps the children are off their hands, they have retired from the working environment and they want something that is a little smaller but they still want to look after themselves. But as I have remarked in issues associated with this&mdash;whether in RSL clubs around
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2917"> Australia or, I think, in other debates in this place&mdash;that is a choice that people make. In the case of nursing homes, however, quite often there is not a choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you one example, because the honourable member for Hindmarsh talked about a couple of nursing homes in her own electorate. The Illawarra Retirement Trust is probably one of the premier providers, if not the premier provider, of aged care accommodation in Illawarra and the south coast. It is a tremendous model. It was to the last government and I believe it continues to be so for the present government. It offers the mix when people make the decision to move into smaller, self-care units and also provides, associated with many of those complexes, the next level: nursing home care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nursing home care is often required by people not because they make a choice about it but because they really have no choice. They need it. It is a higher standard of care, more intensive care&mdash;care which, regrettably, at the end of the day, results in only one way that people leave those nursing homes. That is not the case in hostels or self-care accommodation. There is a basic difference between the two. The opposition is concerned about this issue. People need to find the wherewithal to buy a place in a quality nursing home when it is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing which needs to be said is that we could all go and find some examples, I suspect&mdash;although I do not think there would be too many down in Cunningham and Wollongong&mdash;of millionaires that have been subsidised by governments for going into nursing homes. Because of one or two examples of that, that points to the obvious disparity that there is in the system. But, overwhelmingly, that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also tend to forget people on the lower end of the socioeconomic scale. I must admit that I get a bit sick and tired of both sides of the parliament standing up hairy&hyphen;chested saying, `We are the only ones that represent the battlers.' We all do, let's face it. We represent all people in this country. We all try to make a couple of political points on the way through, but, at the end of the day, those that are in greatest need and those that need
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the care of government are the ones that are equally going to have access to it. Both sides of this parliament, when in government, are going to provide that care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people on lower and fixed incomes&mdash;that is, pensioners&mdash;do not own their own home. They rent or they are in housing commission homes. It is all well and good to talk about user pays, having to sell family homes and all that sort of thing and saying, `Why shouldn't they? If I'm the only one that's left and my husband or my wife has passed away and I need to go into a nursing home, it is fair and reasonable, although I am not going to leave any inheritance to my children.' That is fine, and there are people clearly in the community that fit that description. But there are a vast number of other people that do not. A vast number of people on fixed incomes or low incomes in housing commission homes&mdash;department of housing stock&mdash;around this country require subsidised rents and, if ageing, intensive care assistance. It is well and good that we recognise that from time to time we will get different examples advanced in support of one side of the argument or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The danger&mdash;and we are concerned about this&mdash;is that you tend to develop a system of care which goes from the Rolls Royce model to the `If you have a couple of bob, you're in this one, I'm sorry to say'. But the standard of care is not going to be as great; the standards will not be there. People will not come around to accredited nursing homes to see whether the appropriate standards are there, whether&mdash;as the member for Hindmarsh rightly pointed out from the Gregory report&mdash;the accommodation is six or four to a room, whether toilet facilities are appropriate, whether there is wheelchair access and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We definitely need Australian standards in place or we are in danger of creating two distinct types of facilities for people who need nursing home care&mdash;those who can afford it and go to the Rolls Royce model and those who cannot because they have had limited income in the past. If they have to buy a place, then they have to look at other aspects of how they might achieve that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2918">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have tried to question the minister in this place about that. We have suggested to her on information that we have received that, if these people do not have a home of their own to sell in order to acquire a place in a nursing home&mdash;for a minimum fee of, say, $26,000; many others are using estimates much in excess of that&mdash;other options should be open. What are they? One suggestion made last year was that perhaps family members have to borrow the money to put their beloved relative in a nursing home where care can be provided&mdash;and they therefore leave a debt to the children left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the sorts of issues that constantly need to be advanced in this debate. But philosophically we would say there are people that require care. We do not necessarily believe that it is unfair for the government to pay a contribution towards this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did say I wanted to comment about the whole issue of veterans and war windows particularly and how this might affect them. I am delighted to say again that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is in the chamber. I have said to him before&mdash;I know I have said it in his presence, and I have said it at RSL forums when he has not been present but when, I am sure, it has been reported back to him&mdash;that I felt that in the budget last year he did a very commendable job in maintaining the integrity of the veterans' affairs portfolio. He did a tremendous job in assuming that perhaps they were going to get cut and slashed like most other departments did but he was able to resist that and actually got a few extra dollars thrown towards some of the programs which he has announced recently. I commend him for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also said that regrettably veterans get picked up in the cross&hyphen;portfolio responsibilities that exist as governments&mdash;and, in this case, the Howard government&mdash;look to slash some of the funding so that they can bring their budget in on the levels that they have indicated to the community that they want to reach. Unfortunately, veterans are affected in the pharmaceutical area or by the nursing home entry fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the minister knows, veterans and war windows represent 15 per cent of Australians
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of those aged over 70. In 1995, there was a seminal report on the special aged care needs of the veteran community. It was published by the former government under the stewardship of Con Sciacca, the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The introduction to that report said something quite interesting about veterans, their special needs and entitlements and why we&mdash;I use that in a collective sense, because I think most members of this House go around saying the same thing to the veteran community: that we all owe them a debt of gratitude&mdash;should look after them every step of the way. The introduction of the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taskforce acknowledged that veterans have made a special contribution to Australia which needs to be recognised in a tangible way. Historically, veterans have been treated by the Commonwealth Government as a special group, with the provision of special benefits, income support, health care and compensation. The special status of the veteran community ought to be recognised as a `special community of interest' in aged care planning as veterans reach the final years of their lives and require access to a wide range of aged care services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is absolutely dead right, and I do not think many of us would disagree with it. But the veterans community have been caught by this entry contribution fee for nursing homes. I think it does fall a little short of some of the rhetoric of not my good friend and colleague the present Minister for Veterans' Affairs but people representing their side of politics who, at the time, said that if it were elected the coalition would maintain all existing veterans' entitlements. I have indicated, as I said&mdash;and I repeat it today&mdash;that the minister did very well in retaining most of the entitlements. But it is in cross portfolio areas where regrettably that has not happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that as the people who have defended this country get older&mdash;the TPI pensioners, the war widows and so on&mdash;they require that special assistance and acknowledgment. I would like to think that any government&mdash;whether it be the present government or indeed our government in the 13 years when we had control of these areas&mdash;recognised that that was the case.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2919">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to know and to note that as far as this issue about veterans and, more generally, aged care is concerned there was a fairly telling quote by Mike Seccombe in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> last year. In respect of this whole thing about whether there was a difference of opinion on different sides of the parliament in respect of how funding was found for nursing homes and the maintenance of the special needs of people in nursing homes, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let's not forget the way the Government has turned market forces loose in the nursing home industry. Family Services Minister Judi Moylan continued to sound entirely unconvincing as she denied elderly people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and I might interpose there, including veterans&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would have to sell their homes to pay the entry fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For All of Us was the Liberal election slogan. Now it looks like `caveat emptor', because, basically folks, you're on your own in the market place. Unless of course, you are fortunate enough to be a member of one of those small groups pf privileged people whose tendency to vote conservative is threatened by competition policy. Like newsagents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Well, I am not going to enter into debate about the last part about newsagents, although actually my newsagent is not a bad bloke and he reminds me about the commitment given by the coalition every time I go and get the papers. But it is important that that difference and the highlighting of that difference between user payers and whether or not a government contribution should be there, particularly for those least able to help themselves, do separate us on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister, my friend and colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), has in fact moved an amendment to this legislation in which she has clearly spelt out some of the concerns we have. She believes that this will lead to the creation of economy, business and first&hyphen;class systems of nursing home care. Honestly, I say to the Minister for Family Services and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that that is something which none of us wants to see. What we want to see is quality care for elderly Australians who require age care assistance, particularly those in nursing homes where that very
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> specialised, that very important and intense level of care is provided for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have a problem with this. As I say, we have moved that amendment which I have briefly touched on just there. I say to the minister and to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, my colleague across the table now, that we certainly would join with the government&mdash;no question about that&mdash;if we could establish clear and effective ways to provide health care for elderly Australians, particularly those people who have perhaps lived a very considerable part of their lives on fixed incomes and on low incomes. There is clearly in Australian society a group of people who do need special considerations. Into that I throw, quite obviously, veterans and war widows. We need to ensure that those special considerations are recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, I support the amendment which has been moved by my colleague the member for Jagajaga, but in doing so, to be fair, I acknowledge the contribution that the member for Hindmarsh made. I am sure that our colleague on the other side and others on both sides of the parliament who will speak in this debate will highlight their overwhelming concern for people and the needs of people in their twilight years and the need for continuing to provide adequate care and service for them. It is regrettable that we have on this occasion a fundamental difference as to how those funds should be made available. But then again, that is what makes differences between people; it does between political parties, and we have seen it again here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the member for Jagajaga was a touch unfairly maligned by the member for Hindmarsh saying that she was being hypocritical in some of the comments that she made. She was not indeed; she was putting forward some very deeply held beliefs from the Labor Party's point of view and, simply because she expressed them in such a forthright manner, I do not think she should be described as being hypocritical or perhaps not understanding the process. I think the member for Jagajaga does have that understanding. I think we all respect each other's rights to stand in this place and put a point of view about aged care or anything else. Often there will be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2920"> agreement but, on rare occasions, there is disagreement. This happens to be one such occasion, and our amendment is moved accordingly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) talked about a few of the basic areas of the aged care community in a very concise and monotone way, he did try to ensure that he mixed up a couple of things so that it sounded as if we were not addressing a couple of problems in relation to the question of age care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me address just a couple of those points. During his speech the member for Cunningham talked about the difference between hostels and nursing homes, as well as the differences across the aged care area. He also talked about the need, as he perceived it, to be able to cater for each of those segments of the industry. That is exactly the point we are getting at. What we are saying is that the aged care community&mdash;the people in our community who need care&mdash;do not need to be segmented off into different sections. They need to be looked at as one whole group of people and, within that group of people, they need to be given the level of care that they need at the time. They do not need to be told, `One day you will have to go and live in a hostel. Once your level of care need changes you will have to go somewhere else.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> History shows that, in a lot of cases, people have had to actually move not only across suburbs and cities but also, particularly people in rural and regional areas, across towns and regions. They went to places where they became isolated and they found it difficult. This package is saying that we want to develop a system where people can get the level of care that they need within their establishment and develop that level of care within the establishment. I am afraid the member for Cunningham did not quite cover that point. He still wanted to segment people. That is what the Labor Party want to try and do&mdash;and they always want to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cunningham also made a point about access. Of course, this is typical Labor Party scare tactics: make sure that you scare people by saying that access will not be
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> available. If they read the package of legislation they will see that access will be available across the financial spectrum. There is a guarantee that 30 per cent of places will be concessional for any demographic area. That is important. We are not ignoring the people who might not have those finances, whom the member for Cunningham wanted to then label as people who would suffer because they could not raise the bond to be able to go into care. There is the ability for 30 per cent access across the board and that will be monitored to ensure that those people who require that extra support will get that extra support and that the services they require at the level of care they require will be available to them. It is also worth remembering that we are talking about the government's commitment to aged care&mdash;and that commitment is $2.6 billion. We are not running away from or opting out of making available the care that is needed in our community. I think we should always keep that very clearly in our minds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise here to address the Aged Care Income Testing Bill that is before us. The word `clarity' is what comes foremost to my mind and it is exactly that point of clarity that I was just referring to in relation to the previous speaker, the member for Cunningham. To me, clarity means clearness&mdash;something we all hope for when we are facing that solid wall of bureaucracy. This bill sets out to restore some clarity to the matter of our aged care reform. Clarity is sorely needed because of the frenzy of fear whipped up by the opposition to purposely frighten our aged community into believing they were about to be rendered homeless. Let not any member of the opposition try and deny that point, particularly the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure the people of my electorate are clear on this particular bill, I point out that it will not lead to either a payment of a benefit or a reduction in a benefit. This bill gives no person or government department the power to take or give money. It is a housekeeping bill; let's say it is one for the accountants. We have seen only too clearly the result of bills hastily run through the House with no thought
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2921"> as to how the results are to be administered. This is a bill which establishes important administrative procedures to ensure the reforms introduced by the Aged Care Bill move smoothly into effect on 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was amazed at the fear campaign my constituents were subjected to last year when the Minister for Family Services, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), released her aged care reforms. I had constituents calling me in the belief they were going to be tossed out of their homes. Others were told they would not be able to afford to go into nursing homes. By whom? By members of the Labor opposition. And it is still going on. Two weeks ago, in my electorate, a Labor senator was running out a pro forma letter comprising five paragraphs, one sentence per paragraph, talking about four issues of federal government and two issues of state government. It was all about fear. Three&hyphen;quarters of it was about how to create fear within our elderly community about aged care. That these people were put through such unnecessary stress is nothing short of appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will clear the path to ensure that no resident of an aged care facility has any doubt as to the level of charges they potentially face after 1 July. It is a bill which will enable family services staff to ensure the operators of all aged care facilities know what charges they can levy. To keep matters even clearer, it also points out that this Aged Care Income Testing Bill, along with the reforms to be put into place on 1 July, will not result in a change of costs for full pensioners&mdash;the 30 per cent concessional pensioners that I talked about before&mdash;nor will it result in means testing or entry contributions for those full pensioners. Let us not forget that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill basically allows the bureaucracy a three&hyphen;month advance time to get its income testing books in order. There is no doubt there will be changes to the fee structure in aged care facilities from 1 July. The aged care reforms seek a greater contribution for aged care from those in the community who have the ability to pay. That is a very important point that we must remember. In the MPI today we heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) talk about the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pyramid flattening at the top because of the growth in the number of aged people in our community. We must have reforms in place to be able to address that important fact of life that is taking place in this country and must take place because of the current demographic structures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that there will be changes to the fee structures. The aged care reforms seek a greater contribution. The income testing bill will allow the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to start income testing residents in nursing homes and hostels before 1 July when our reforms will take effect. The bill allows department bureaucrats to check with each other and exchange data&mdash;a very important factor. I believe it is important that all residents and potential residents of aged care facilities realise that this assessment utilises the same income testing arrangements currently being used by those departments. The department of family services is not generating an income testing system of its own. The determination of income for these people will be based on information they have already given to Social Security and Veterans' Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thought of people in nursing homes and hostels being further confused by the Labor Party's misinformation machine is something that does not bear thinking about. Every day in this House the member for Jagajaga gets up to either ask a question or address one of the bills in this reform and it is all about driving fear into the community rather than saying, `Look I might have some objections.' At least we heard the member for Cunningham say, `I have some concerns in a couple of areas,' but he saw some merit in the legislation. We have all got to talk about the positives as well as the negatives. The member for Jagajaga consistently comes into this place and drives this problem of fear and misinformation that is disturbing people in my community and, can I suggest, people right across Australia.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2922"> Social Security or the Department of Veterans' Affairs to find out if their status has changed is not much better. This will not happen because the bill sets out to create clarity. It will mean that prior to implementation of the new income testing arrangements all residents will have received their assessment from either Social Security or Veterans' Affairs and so will the aged care facilities. Everyone should be well informed before changes are made. Hence, as I say, a return to clarity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The assessment could well mean for many residents of homes that they discover they have been paying over and above the required amount. As it stands, the bureaucrats do not know how much people are paying&mdash;not a tidy situation at all and certainly not efficient for the government, the taxpayer or the resident of the hostel or the nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am all for making procedures clearer and simpler. It is difficult enough for a person still in the work force to keep on top of the paperwork and information flow just to run the personal side of their daily life. For an elderly retired person in care it is almost impossible. Therefore, it is up to the government and those running the aged care facilities to make it as simple as possible. Getting the answer to the simplest question, particularly from a government department, can be time consuming, sometimes costly and almost always frustrating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this Aged Care Income Testing Bill can clear the pathway to the changes which take effect on 1 July then we will have saved many people a great deal of frustration. Thanks to Labor's scare campaign there is still a great deal of confusion in the community. It is not difficult to understand when you consider the income test has been set at 25c for each dollar of private income over and above the weekly pension plus the $49 of free income allowed. Once again, this reinforces the fact that 30 per cent of availability in nursing homes or in the aged care facilities will be available to concessional people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also allows for people to request a review of their assessment if their circumstances change. We have had to acknowledge that the aged care sector is in desperate need
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of reform because of the last 13 years of not being prepared to face up to the problems that exist and the demographic changes that are naturally going to take place in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ability to support those people who do not have an income or any assets at all can be maintained at a decent level only if those who have the means pay an equitable share of their care. I think the member for Hindmarsh covered that point exceptionally well when she talked about the families of aged care recipients who might like to feel that they deserve all the assets of their parents, rather than their parents being able to ensure that they can contribute some of their money, if they have got it, towards a quality level of care for themselves. This bill marks the beginning of restoring some clarity to the important matter of caring for Australia's aged community. I support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

The first thing she did was attack the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) on the point of irrelevance, saying that she wandered far from the main point of this Aged Care Income Testing Bill. Then the member for Hindmarsh started talking about toilet seats and anything else she may have struggled to attach to the issue of nursing homes and hostels. She ranged far more broadly than the member for Jagajaga did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My first job in this place tonight is to defend the honour of the member for Jagajaga. I can assure the House that the member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister, is a very genuine person with some real and sympathetic concerns about the future of those who are part of our aged community. The member for Jagajaga is not running a scaremongering campaign, as the member for Griffith suggested. What is scaring people is the uncertainty created by what is indeed policy on the run. I have not heard the shadow minister at any point misrepresent the position of the government, nor have I heard the Minister for Family Services, the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan),
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2923"> successfully challenge the member for Jagajaga on the accuracy of any of the issues she has raised in terms of the government's new aged care policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, it is the role of the shadow minister to highlight to the Australian community the inequities and faults within the proposed legislation. Governments make decisions within financial constraints. Ministers go to the ERC and they are often rolled. The policy that they eventually put to the parliament is not always the one which they would have liked to have presented to the parliament. But having been rolled they have no choice. There is no doubt that, having lost the fight, any piece of legislation which is funded with less money than the minister may have hoped will have some nasties in it. It is a simple fact of politics. Indeed, it is the first lesson in politics. The minister at the table knows that there are some nasties contained both in this bill and in the bill that will follow it. But, of course, as part of ministerial solidarity, she must come into this place and defend it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the role of the shadow minister to highlight the  inequities in the bill and I know that she will continue to do so and to do so very well. What she did particularly well today was highlight in great detail the financial impact this bill and the bill that is to follow it will have on the older members of our community, particularly part pensioners and non&hyphen;pensioners. What she also did by way of an amendment, which I rise to support, is point out in some detail just how this bill is flawed. The second part of that amendment states:</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which the honourable member for Jagajaga made in the amendment, nor do I need to go over again the detailed financial aspects of the impact this will have on older Australians. What I do want to do is speak a bit more broadly by saying that this Aged Care Income Testing Bill is the precursor to something very nasty. It is the first step to removing a longstanding principle in this country that aged care should be equally available to all Australians regardless of their means. It is also a first step by this government towards the total abrogation of its responsibility for the provision of aged care in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government began with the introduction of this bill is the systematic dismantling of the aged care system as we have known it to date. The bill seeks to put in place the necessary administrative arrangements to accommodate the Aged Care Bill, the detail of which we wait for with great anticipation. The Aged Care Bill will of course introduce a nursing home entry tax for the very first time. It will also whack nursing home residents with a new system of assessing daily residential contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government likes to call it a `bond'&mdash;I call it an entry tax&mdash;in the same way that the government likes to call the new superannuation tax a `surcharge'. But make no mistake about it: the Australian people are not fooled by these colourful names. They see them all for what they are. They know that the super tax, the nursing home entry tax, the reef tax and the additional Medicare tax are just that&mdash;new taxes, in blatant breach of the government's pre-election commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You and I both know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as all members of this House know, members of the Australian public dislike deceit very much. As I said in this House last night on another matter, it is true to say that at the moment the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) enjoys some credibility and popularity out there in the marketplace. But we also know that that popularity is absolutely underpinned by a perception that he is a credible politician, that he is Honest John&mdash;a tag that we on this side of the House applied to the Prime Minister in a derisory way but which, due to his good fortune, has now been picked up by
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2924"> the media as a genuine description of his approach to public policy in this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We all know that that perception is going to turn. We all know that once this measure starts to bite and once all those other fiscally restraining measures that were announced in the budget of last year start to bite out there in the electorate&mdash;many of those have not even taken effect yet&mdash;those polls are certainly going to turn on the Prime Minister. He will quickly learn that you cannot possibly seek to ride out a full term of government driven only by the polls and relying entirely on deceit. It catches up with you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No issue out there in the electorate will bite harder than the bill that follows this bill, the bill that seeks to introduce both a nursing home entry fee for the first time ever and new daily charges for those who reside in those nursing homes at their cost. Mr Deputy Speaker, the issue is already biting in my electorate and I am sure it is biting in yours. I am very sure it is biting in the electorates of the member for Hindmarsh and the member for Griffith because that is why they are in here so defensive today. That is why the member for Hindmarsh was almost out of control, grasping at any issue she could to try to divert attention from the main points in this bill and the one that follows it. They are, indeed, biting very hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aged in my community, and the families of those people who will be affected by these measures, are very worried indeed. I can assure you it does not take any scaremongering from the member for Jagajaga for that to be achieved. One only needs to look back upon newspaper reports in the months following the budget, and the minister's performance during question time, if one is seeking a source of the fear that exists within the community. We haven't needed the assistance of the member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister, to create that fear. The minister and the government have been doing a pretty good job of that all on their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who seek to defend the entry fee say that it is equitable because those who can afford to pay should pay to reduce the burden on the government's budget. Every nasty measure that gets introduced to this place
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> harks back to the so&hyphen;called deficit which was left by the Labor government. It is now more than 12 months since the election. The government is going to have to start taking responsibility for its own role in government rather than attempt to hark back to any deficit that may have been left it by the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They say they are going to do more. I cannot see any benefits for either current residents of nursing homes or those who might access them in the future. The member for Hindmarsh had a lot to say about some appalling nursing homes in her electorate. The member for Hindmarsh should be rather ashamed about all that. She has been in this House certainly a little bit longer than I have, and I would have thought that, if she was all that concerned about the standard of care being offered in her electorate, she would have been in here fighting and doing something about it&mdash;fighting for more funding to improve those facilities rather than whacking the aged in the community as a backdoor method of addressing those problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also says that all it is doing with these measures is extending the existing arrangements which the Labor government put in place for the nursing home sector. They have missed a very important point. The move to a hostel is a lifestyle choice usually made months or even years in advance. Unfortunately, when it comes time to enter a nursing home, there is no choice and often there is no forewarning. So there is a very big difference between the two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very weak argument to come in here and say, `This is fine. You blokes were just as bad. You did it on hostels. It is all right for us to do it to nursing homes.' That is a very poor argument indeed. They tell us that Australians need to share the burden of fiscal consolidation. I would have thought that the aged in our community would have been the last they would have turned to when seeking to reduce that fiscal burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The older Australians being attacked by this bill before the House today, and the bill which will follow it, have contributed to the income of this country for many years&mdash;for most of their lives&mdash;some of them significant
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2925"> ly. Governments raise taxes to redistribute that income to make a fairer society to ensure everyone within this nation has access to basic services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is basically done in two ways. Some of the money raised in taxes and charges is returned to those in need of assistance in the form of cash benefits, but much of it is returned in the form of non&hyphen;cash benefits by providing schools, road networks, hospitals, public housing and aged care facilities. The government uses the tax system to ensure that all Australians have equal access to these basic services and others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system is not about penalising those who have worked hard all their lives and saved in order that they may live just above the poverty line and pass on to their children and their families some of the fruits of that labour. It is not about that at all. Which of these two methods would you think plays the greatest role in narrowing the gap between the haves and the have&hyphen;nots in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who read the Australian Statistician's report last year entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The effects of government benefits and taxes on household income</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">will know the answer to that question. The answer is that it is the provision of non&hyphen;cash benefits which does the most to achieve a fairer society in this country. The Statistician's report tells us a bit more than that, and I thank the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald's</EMPHASIS>  Ross Gittins for his assistance in making sense of some of those figures in an article one Saturday last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Statistician took Australia's 6.6 million households and ranked them according to their gross income, which is private income plus cash benefits from government. He then broke them up into five quintiles and determined the impact on each group of the government's taxes and charges. The figures were based on the 1993&hyphen;94 financial year and showed that the poorest households had their average income increased by $220 per week and the richest households had their incomes reduced by $355 per week because of the impact of tax and non&hyphen;cash benefits. There is a significant effect there. The Statistician found that it is not the tax system which plays the greatest role in achieving this result.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Indeed he found  that the tax system plays very little role at all, mainly because of the impact of the regressive taxes and charges imposed by the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Statistician did find was that cash benefits reduce inequality in household incomes by about 25 per cent. Even more importantly, and bringing me to the point I would like to make, non&hyphen;cash benefits reduce inequality by about 20 per cent. This is what the Statistician found. And why? Because they are not means tested. Cash benefits have a certain effect because of their means tested nature. Non&hyphen;cash benefits have a different effect. So while the dollar value of these non&hyphen;cash benefits was found to be worth around $135 per week across all households, that $135 represented 74 per cent of the gross incomes of poorer families but only 8 per cent of the gross incomes of higher income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you see is this: by this government's constant attack on the provision of services&mdash;by virtue of the decisions in last year's budget, including this decision to charge entry fees and to change the arrangements for paying for accommodation&mdash;it is further increasing the gap in this country between the haves and the have&hyphen;nots. That is not what governments are about. Governments should be about decreasing that gap, ensuring a more equitable society. This bill and the bill which it purports to assist does just the opposite. On that basis the government should be really ashamed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this bill also does is put the cart before the horse. The government is asking us to accept a bill which will be used later to support a concept that the parliament has not yet agreed to. The government has no way of being sure that those nursing home entry fees and those changed arrangements in daily fees will pass this parliament. It can be sure that we will not be supporting it on this side of the House. Its eventual fate will rest in the hands of senators in the other place. But it puts the cart before the horse. In my view it is rather rude to ask us to support a bill that acts only to support legislation that has not yet enjoyed the imprimatur of this House. On that basis it is flawed. I oppose it and I

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Aged Care Income Testing Bill. It is, for want of a better word, the preface to the Aged Care Bill 1997 that, as the minister indicated in her second reading speech, will be tabled shortly. This bill establishes an administrative course by which the income testing arrangements for aged care reform that was announced in the last budget will follow. It is evidence of the government's spine. It sets in place policy which the opposition, when in government, were too afraid to touch. This legislation has responsibility stamped all over it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is part of the legislative agenda to implement the aged care reforms, endorsed by the former Labor member and minister Gary Johns, that were announced in the budget last year. The bill allows for the income testing of nursing home residents in advance of the Aged Care Bill, which implements those reforms announced in the budget. The purpose of implementing this bill now is to assist the Department of Social Security, which will require three months prior to the commencement of the Aged Care Bill on 1 July 1997 to undertake the assessments provided for in the bill. It will also assist residents of nursing homes and hostels in planning for their needs by providing them with their assessment and the charges they will face under the new reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important aspect of the bill. Following the budget last year we had many members opposite, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) in particular, misrepresenting the actual details of the budget in relation to residents of nursing homes. They went around telling people that they would be forced to sell their homes to enter a nursing home, amongst a plethora of other humbug. All the member for Jagajaga was doing was scaring those most vulnerable in our community, for which she ought to be thoroughly ashamed. The passage of the legislation will at least ensure residents of nursing homes are not scared witless by members opposite simply for the sake of scoring a few cheap political
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> points by ensuring that in advance of the commencement of the Aged Care Bill they are advised of the outcome of the income assessments and the level of charges they face when the Aged Care Bill is passed. This bill ensures residents are provided with detailed information and offers certainty about the aged care reforms on their individual situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 3 of the bill provides for the right of appeal if a resident is not satisfied with the outcome of the income assessment. The bill also protects the privacy of residents by imposing penalties if any information obtained under the authority of this legislation is used for purposes other than those required under the legislation. I note that these privacy protections have been drafted with the assistance of the Privacy Commission. As the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) stated in her second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When income testing is in operation after 1 July only those who can afford to pay a little more and make a fair contribution will be asked to do so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is nothing wrong with that, although the Labor Party does not think so apparently, from what be have heard here today. The Labor Party thinks that, whether you have $1 to your name or $1 million to your name, you should be treated the same. We are simply asking those who have the capacity to make a contribution to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have just heard the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) talk about the fact that we are promoting the haves and the have&hyphen;nots regime in this society. I would have thought, au contraire, we are doing precisely the opposite. We are asking the people who can afford to pay to pay. We are looking after the battlers that so vigorously abandoned the Labor Party at the last election. I read an interview with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in the Autumn 1997 edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent Retiree</EMPHASIS> magazine. The interviewer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When federal Labor was in office, many Labor MPs, when addressing our branch meetings, advised our members to dispose their assets and apply for the age pension.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That just about highlights the moral bankruptcy of the Labor Party. They wanted people to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2927"> relinquish their responsibility and let the government be big bother so they could pull all the strings and be totally in control. They wanted people beholden to the government, and that is irresponsible advice from the Labor Party, particularly given that we have an ageing society here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is reasonable to ask those who can afford to make a contribution to do so and to provide policies so that people provide for their retirement so they can look after themselves in retirement. I think that is an outcome that most of the people in the Australian society would wish for. The minister did go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Older people will not be asked to pay what they cannot afford for the residential aged care services they need.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is responsible policy from a very responsible government, and a particularly responsible minister. As I have said, this bill is simply to allow an administrative procedure to be undertaken in advance of the Aged Care Bill&mdash;that is, to allow the Department of Health and Family Services, in cooperation with the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs, to commence income testing and advise residents in nursing homes of the charges they may face. This is required well in advance as it will take some time to conduct those income tests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should wrap up by taking the opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Family Services on proceeding with this particular legislation. I have noted in the media some disparaging reports about the minister, but she has shown considerable spine in standing her ground with regard to this bill and the foreshadowed Aged Care Bill, which will introduce the charges for nursing home residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from the minister's performance being average, which the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper alleged, the minister has shown compassion, commonsense, responsibility and, I think, a total understanding of all the issues involved. The only average performance in this debate on nursing home fees has been from the opposition and the member for Jagajaga in particular, who has deliberately staged a fear campaign against very reasonable and consis
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tent changes proposed by the minister. The Labor Party has done this to scare those most vulnerable in the community in a cheap attempt, as I said, to score some political points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of things I would like to take up. I was tut&hyphen;tutting and clicking the old tongue in the office a few moments ago when I was listening to what the member for Jagajaga was saying, things that were clearly completely wrong. It has been suggested that the direct deduction of fees from pension payments by the Department of Social Security could provide administrative efficiencies. However, under the provisions of social security legislation, pensions are inalienable and direct deductions of income tested fees are, therefore, precluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Resident fees will necessarily be affordable since they are based on an income test. The variable fees system in hostels already demonstrates the capacity of providers to manage the administration involved in the collection of varying amounts from individual residents, and the administration skills required by the new system will be similar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister referred to effective marginal tax rates of around 94 per cent. This is an absolutely, completely, totally and utterly ludicrous suggestion. I do not know where this woman dreams up these figures from. Residential charges are not a tax. People in residential care pay for their living expenses just like all of us in the rest of the community. That is only fair. I think anyone would understand that is only fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in the community who are able to pay their own living expenses do not expect Australian taxpayers to support them. They do not imagine that, when they buy their food at the local supermarket or when they pay for their housing, it is somehow a tax any more than the money which nursing home residents pay towards their board and their accommodation. If you accept the erroneous proposition that nursing home residents' living expenses are a tax, of course you arrive at a high effective marginal tax rate. You would get the same result if you added rent or mortgage payments or food bills to calculate the effective marginal tax rates of people in the com
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2928"> munity. I think it is totally ludicrous and I cannot imagine how she could possibly introduce that argument into this particular debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the minister&mdash;who is here in the House at the moment, I am very happy to see&mdash;on the initiative. I welcome this bill as well as the whole package of the government's aged care reforms. You have to reflect quietly to yourself at some stage when you are debating issues like this and others: how can you possibly trust an opposition and what they have to say when they have sitting on their front bench a former Western Australian Premier&mdash;and I found out at 10 minutes to four this afternoon from the AAP report that Western Australian police are `weeks away from deciding whether former federal Health Minister Carmen Lawrence would face perjury charges arising from findings of the 1995 Easton Royal Commission.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aged Care Income Testing Bill is a very important piece of legislation, particularly as it affects the most vulnerable group within our community. I certainly hope the government is not opposed to some vigorous and strong debate on this issue, as we on this side point out what we feel are quite serious faults with this piece of legislation. I certainly congratulate the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), our shadow minister responsible for this area of legislation, for her outstanding representations on behalf of the senior citizens of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this bill is really to give effect to the government's decision to introduce nursing home entrance fees and income tested daily fees from 1 July 1997. The bill itself is a very sneaky and backdoor method of trying to obtain information that the government needs to prove that their new scheme will actually work. In other words, they have introduced a new scheme with much fanfare and have caused major fears and concerns for many elderly people, and they did it without actually knowing the financial basis upon which it will be required to work. If the information they gathered is not what they wanted to hear, what will they do next to attack the elderly and their meagre savings? The government tries to tell us that they are in fact permitting an option. What nonsense that is. No nursing home will refuse to accept the invitation to make this up-front charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expressed some concerns about aged care in my maiden speech and I have followed it through fairly carefully since that point. In that speech, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the election campaign I received a number of representations from aged care villages in my electorate. These villages expressed a belief that aged care was being neglected by all major parties.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2929">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government's response for the need to give more consideration in this area of social need and responsibility is to whack on an alleged voluntary minimum fee and then to walk away from the problem. In fact they are really going to physically walk away, because they will eventually allow the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) to transfer responsibilities of aged care to one or more of the states. Given the minister's approach to this issue, I forecast that there will be a very speedy transfer of responsibilities on this issue to the states. I can recall raising the issue of the need for funds for capital works during debate on last year's budget. I said then:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The residential aged care system will be put into reverse with a deteriorating system having no funds available for new capital works, replacements or upgradings in 1996&hyphen;97. The promise of special funding for dementia patients to apply from 1 January has not been honoured.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is no answer to the need for these funds for the government to simply wash its hands of the system and say, `The solution is for us to now permit an up-front fee of, say, $25,000.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a responsibility to the aged people of this nation to provide funds for capital works. It has a responsibility to the aged people of this nation to ensure that they are not emotionally torn apart by the sale of their home to get one partner into aged care. We will become a nation of moral bankrupts if we continue to pursue a policy of this mental torture of our aged people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just not possible for the aged care industry to survive with proper and decent accommodation and surroundings without government help towards capital expenditure. The up-front payment of at least $25,000 by persons trying to enter the aged care system will do very little to assist the capital works or maintenance programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very impressed with an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 27 February by Mr Bob Ellis, who wrote about the effects this government's policy will have for his mother. I readily concede that Bob Ellis is not a known supporter of the government. In fact, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) could verify that fact for us. Nevertheless, Bob Ellis's comments are important,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and I would like to briefly quote from the article he wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. It reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are lots of memories in the house&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">referring to his mother's house&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">keep your own house, Else</EMPHASIS> &mdash;but of course she'll have to sell it now, or soon. She hates the thought and so do I. Selling their houses destroyed her sister, Edna, and her old friend, Dot, when they went into nursing homes. There was no longer the sustaining fantasy of a house to return to and they soon wilted and despaired and died. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Keep your own house, Else</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the mathematics are such that she will have to sell it. She has $14,000 in the bank and the house is worth $160,000 probably and the entrance fee of a good nursing home won't be under $50,000, wait and see. She'll have to sell it. And have nowhere to dream of coming home to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Ellis went on in some detail about the issue, but he asked the question in a manner which I think we could all relate to&mdash;certainly those on this side of the House:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What a mean and coldeyed government this is, tormenting only the weak in their extremity, the blacks, the kids, the arriving migrants, the single mothers&mdash;punishing them for the black holes and bad arithmetic of the Treasury bureaucrats. And for what? To impress four sadomonetarists in Moody's with our Economic correctness.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article was a clear and legible explanation of what will be the reaction of so many of our elderly people throughout Australia. It is not good enough, and it is quite clear the blame lies at the door of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also says there will be a quota of places set aside for those unable to pay an entrance fee and the providers will be paid a daily rate by the government for these residents. Charles Dickens is on the return. Here we have a whole new and 1997 style of poorhouse treatment. While we are setting aside quotas, will we also set aside particular sections of an aged care establishment for these quota people? Can we imagine how these people will feel when they enter the place of need and find they are in quota lanes or quota blocks? I expect they will be fed quota meals to match quota status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is terrible what is being proposed and it is a sad reflection on the attitude of the government and the minister, but they simply
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2930"> cannot and will not listen to the warnings that are being raised about the proposals contained in this legislation. In my consideration of the budget, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With our aging population more people are making use of community care. Additional funds are urgently needed in this area also.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This whole area of aged care is fast becoming a war zone, with the fund cuts being inflicted upon it by this government. There are so many areas of help needed and they all relate back to the care of our aged people within the system of the aged care homes and our at home care for the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Palliative care is an area of real need for aged people. Again, this is an area in great difficulty. I note that in my own state of New South Wales the Minister for Health, Andrew Refshauge, has expressed real concern at fund cuts emerging in this area. I want to make further comments on this later, if time permits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To return to the government's intention arising from this bill, I draw attention to the absolute stupidity of merging hostels and nursing home systems. The two systems are quite separate in provision of the needs of their clients. Those people entering hostels do so for a number of reasons. Sometimes it is for companionship, sometimes it is to ease the strain of cooking meals. There are always a number of reasons. But always the people are mostly self&hyphen;sufficient and do not need actual nursing. The staffing needs are quite different and the nursing factor is much less. Hostels are a more acceptable form of care for senior people. The main reason is the wide adaptability to each and every physical and medical need. Hostels are a satisfactory and cost&hyphen;effective way to address most afflictions of the ageing society without loss of dignity and freedom of choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the nursing home area the need is usually crisis and the staffing is often quite specialised. How can we therefore expect these two systems to merge properly? We cannot; and they should not. The government is trying to call the up&hyphen;front fee an accommodation bond but, as I said earlier, nursing homes are to be allowed only limited access to the total funds lodged and that will simply not assist in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> upgrading work on these properties and associated facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even worse, there is no compulsion on the providers to even spend the money on improvements of facilities and services. The requirements of nursing homes to pass a minimum building quality inspection to allow them to charge entrance fees is also one that has its pitfalls. It is possible that homes most in need of an upgrade and which would be supposed to be benefiting from this plan by the minister will in fact be unable to accept the income stream that is alleged to have flowed to facilitate the upgrade. The department has estimated that this problem applies to about 35 per cent of nursing homes&mdash;a third at least&mdash;and I have no doubt that many others will fall into this category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the protection of the aged person's accommodation bond. Are we going to insist that their money be lodged with an aged care equivalent of a rental bond board? I very much doubt it. What will then happen is that although the homes are permitted to access only $13,000 of the accommodation bond there is going to be a massive and unacceptable fraud perpetrated throughout Australia on our aged community. A letter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of 25 February by Mrs Aileen Pereira says in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is asking elderly people to put up `part of their life savings' as a `bond' or `interest free loan' to the nursing home proprietors on entry to invest at whatever interest rate they can get until they use it to upgrade or improve the capital value of their investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this the elderly lender will not receive any interest, not even the 4% deeming rate available in a pensioner bank account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are also required to pay $2600 per year out of this donation over and above the usual fees for five years or until they leave, at which time the balance is returned to the estate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Depending on the nursing home's number of beds, after a number of years the nursing home people could be looking after a tidy sum of the patients' money.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That point has been clearly spelt out in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  of last Saturday by Adele Horin who, in respect of this question, said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2931">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We face the prospect of some private homes, including ones that are in good physical condition, being flush with funds. For example, a 100&hyphen;bed facility, charging an $80,000 fee could earn about $600,000 a year in interest. It would be under no legal obligation to do one iota of improvements if it meets basic standards.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Aged people have always been the most vulnerable. There must be real prudential arrangements and protections put in place before the first payment is extracted from an aged person. Let me briefly comment on another aspect of this problem of aged care that is clearly going to be affected by the implementation of the government's policy&mdash;and I have referred to it briefly; that of palliative care. Many people choose to either not enter nursing homes or not have their partners placed in nursing homes when they become very ill. These people choose to give palliative care at home, with government assistance. This must be taking some of the strain off the already crowded nursing home system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was appalled to read a media report from the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, Dr Andrew Refshauge, on 26 February on this important issue. Dr Refshauge has been forced to draw attention to the federal government's cut in the funds to the states in this area of aged and health care. He pointed out that the services at risk were seven&hyphen;day a week, 24&hyphen;hour a day community based palliative care services, palliative medical training and palliative care services in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any reduction in funding for this type of service is going to mean that more and more people will need the service of nursing homes. Has the government thought of all its aged and health care policies in a global manner? I suspect it has not; and cabinet should call for an immediate review of these types of issues. If cabinet will not do it, perhaps when there is enough push from the people, as happened with the Austudy issue, the same nervous backbench coalition MPs will join with us for a review in this area. And not before time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite incredible that in this whole debate that has occurred from the budget to now, the government was unaware of its costings. Only now, by the introduction of the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aged care income testing bill, can it begin to try to get the needed information to actually implement its main policy thrust. I support the view that the introduction of the daily fees will ultimately lead to the creation of a first and third class system of nursing home care. Nursing homes are much more likely to take those who can afford to pay the daily rate and continue to pay it as it increases, as it surely will. I quote again from Mrs Pereira's letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When this budget was brought down we were promised the elderly would feel hardly any effects. Yet we have seen:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> high cuts to dental care;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> increased charges for prescriptions;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> low bank interest rates on savings;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> higher bank charges where savings of the elderly are funding lower home mortgage rates and assisting bank profits;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> and now they fund the nursing home industry interest free.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Once again I will refer to the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  by Adele Horin. She opens her article with these remarks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Coalition promised before the last election a better deal for nursing home residents, few dreamed it meant the residents themselves would have to foot the bill for higher standards. Few twigged the frail old would have to sell their homes to provide the capital for nursing home improvements while the Government would save itself $560 million over four years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, in any debate of this nature we put our views as forcefully as we possibly can in support of the position we are taking. But I would like to conclude my remarks by briefly referring to a fax I received from Ellen Long, one of the leaders of a senior citizen organisation in my electorate of Greenway. I asked her to give me some of her views on this particular piece of legislation. She has given me a fairly lengthy document and has used fairly strong language, but I will simply paraphrase some of the points she is making. The views I now put are not mine but hers. She has been speaking to a large number of senior citizens, and she states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most alarming conversations took place between myself and many senior couples about this problem of future care and the family home. Of thirty couples that I spoke to eight . . .
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2932">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If I could put it this way: eight `would rather be dead than separated'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with one partner being homeless.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The other point made by Mrs Long was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Early immigrants are considering the move back to their home country where governments have a kinder more caring attitude to the aging process.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A further point she makes is that some:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . non home owners expressed much alarm at the prospect of living in a place that carries first and second class passengers. First class persons would receive first class all the way, and they, the unskilled&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the term she used&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would be fed leftovers to eat, live in sub standard rooms with institutional decor.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Finally, she makes this appeal:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If our government is serious about meeting the needs of our seniors, perhaps they need to look and listen in our less affluent areas of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I strongly make the point that there is a need for this government to look at and listen to those groups of people, being referred to in this statement, who reside in our less affluent areas of Australia. Mrs Long continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many senior organisations are out there, a simple questionnaire could easily be put in place.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I therefore support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Jagajaga. While on this occasion we may not have the numbers to carry the amendment, I believe that those out there in the electorate will take a strong and favourable interest in what we have said on this issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point the Labor Party seems to be missing in this evening's entire debate, of which the Aged Care Income Testing Bill now before us is a part, is that the reason for income testing and means testing is to ensure that the needy in the community do get the service which is provided to them by the Commonwealth. That is what this is all about. It is to ensure there is no abuse of taxpayer funded services by the middle or upper classes in this country. This is exactly what the Labor Party was concerned about when it was arguing in favour of the assets test applying to pensioner applicants of over 70 years of age. Going back to those days, the Labor Party argued: why should the former Prime Minister Sir William
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> McMahon get paid a pension? Indeed, why should he? And, similarly, why should Kerry Packer be able to enter a nursing home for free?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the salient point in this debate, and the Labor Party has rather lost the plot a little in that regard. It was the Labor Party that introduced these measures into hostels. Also, it was the Labor Party that was planning to extend these measures into nursing homes, because the report it commissioned and paid for from Professor Gregory indicated that all was not well in aged care services in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I go any further, I will refute a couple of the comments that have been made by the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). I note the odd part (1) of her amendment which reads that the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . deplores the government's decision to charge a daily fee for nursing home residents which will ultimately lead to the creation of an `economy, business and first class' system of nursing home care . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Obviously, the member for Jagajaga has not taken the opportunity to go along and talk to many of the operators and community based organisations that provide and have established nursing homes and nursing home care throughout Australia, because their total focus is on providing the best care possible to all residents of their nursing homes. They are not likely to embark on what is being alleged by the member for Jagajaga. The government obviously will vote against that amendment, and refute the allegations being made by the member for Jagajaga in her amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of other comments were made by the member for Jagajaga in her contribution to this debate, the first of which was with regard to direct deduction from pension payments. She suggested that the deduction of fees from pension payments by the Department of Social Security could provide administrative efficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, under the provisions of social security legislation pensions are inalienable, and direct deductions of income tested fees are therefore precluded. Resident fees will necessarily be affordable since they are based
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2933"> on an income test. The variable fees system in hostels already demonstrates the capacity of providers to manage the administration involved in the collection of varying amounts from individual residents, and the administration skills required by the new system will be similar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In discussions with consumer representatives, the government has been advised of their outright rejection of this proposal. In consultation, that has been canvassed, and it has been rejected by consumer representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue about which the member for Jagajaga seemed a little confused was residential charges and marginal tax rates. She referred to `an effective marginal tax rate of around 94 per cent'. It is a ridiculous suggestion that it is a tax; it is a residential charge. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you or I, travelling around the countryside, go and stay in a motel and get sustenance, we pay for it. If someone is staying and being cared for in a nursing home, they pay for it, it is a residential charge. So residential charges are not taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister should not be alarmist. It is the phraseology she has used. The Labor Party has a tendency to do this: to use different phraseology, different words, to try to stir up concern amongst the community. That is what I think the shadow minister has been doing here in calling that residential charge a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in residential care pay for their living expenses, just as do people in the community. This is only fair. People in the community who are able to pay their own living expenses do not expect Australian taxpayers to support them. They do not imagine that, when they buy their food at a supermarket or pay for their housing, it is somehow a tax any more than the money which nursing home residents pay towards their board and accommodation is a tax. Their residential charges are accommodation fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you accept the erroneous proposition that nursing home residents' living expenses are a tax, you then arrive at the high effective marginal tax rate that the shadow minister was talking about. You would get the same result if you added rent, mortgage payments
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or food bills to calculate the effective marginal tax rates of people in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, this is an alarmist tactic being used by the Labor Party in this whole debate, just as they did when they scurried out of this place after the budget last year and frightened the living daylights out of all those senior citizens in the community who will face at some stage in the not too distant future the prospect of having to enter a nursing home. The Labor Party conjured up the prospect of those people having to sell their houses and the prospect of their partners being left with nowhere to live&mdash;it was just ridiculous!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, not much more than 12 months ago&mdash;I am sure this happened in your electorate as it did in mine&mdash;in the last federal election campaign the Labor Party got up to the absolutely outrageous practice of sending senior citizens, particularly pensioners, completely false Telstra accounts: `This is what is going to happen to you with the sale of Telstra.' These false accounts, the ones that were distributed in my electorate, were printed by one of the unions in the Hunter Valley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sort of nonsense that the Labor Party gets up to. It is not straight, it is not fair dinkum and it is not honest with the people of Australia. This went on for many years while the Labor Party was in power in this country. It tried to continue it during that election campaign with those outrageously high and false Telstra accounts. But all it did was scare the senior citizens in our community. And that is all that is happening in this debate on this reform package: the Labor Party is trying to frighten the senior citizens and the aged people in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the Labor government has left us with an enormous problem to sort out in this country. To its credit, the coalition government is sticking to that task and making some hard decisions. The people of Australia accept that there are hard decisions. They also accept the fact that this government was elected to make those decisions. The Australian people wanted a government that was prepared to govern for future generations, not just for today and not just for its own
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2934"> benefit. That is basically what this is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred earlier to the Labor funded Gregory review. From that review I will quote from the section headed `The Condition of Nursing Home Stock':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first report concluded that the current system of nursing home funding does not seem to provide sufficient incentive for the maintenance of the quality of nursing home buildings and the replenishment of nursing home capital stock over time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lack of incentive to maintain good quality nursing home stock is a result of the funding system, under which nursing homes receive a set amount for each resident, based on resident frailty, which is the same regardless of the age or condition of the building. There is no depreciation element included in the funding to provide for the replacement of buildings and, even if there were, there would be no incentive for homes to spend this money on rebuilding. There is also close to 100% occupancy which leaves little opportunity to attract additional residents and thus income by improving building quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The survey also recorded the number of people in each room of the nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The results have been set out in a table. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . 12% of residents are in rooms with 5 or more beds, with 6%, 3,600 people across all non-Government homes, being in rooms with 6 or more beds. While there is no absolute standard as to how many nursing home residents should share a room, most people would regard having this many people in a room as unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further 39% of residents are in rooms with three or four beds which would be seen by many people as undesirable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At that stage of the review, the Labor government did not like what it was hearing from Professor Gregory: like the overall health system in this country, the area of funding for nursing homes was heading towards disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my part of Australia, in my electorate on the mid north coast of New South Wales, we have been in a crisis situation for years in the provision of nursing home beds. There is always a waiting list. We always have problems with people who, having gone through the aged care assessment team and been assessed as needing nursing home care, then have to be shuffled off to Newcastle and Sydney. They might be in nursing home care there for six or 12 months, waiting for a bed
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to become available in the local area so that they can come back and be domiciled in the local area near their loved ones. If you have been involved in a circumstance such as that, with a close relative who may be infirm having to stay away at that stage of their lives, you will know that it is not very nice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government is genuinely trying to address a very serious issue which is not going to go away, which we cannot ignore and which really does need some major attention. It is interesting to note some of the comments that have been made along the way since August last year when this package was announced in the budget. I will quote from a few of the comments made by people who should know and understand some of the problems that lie ahead as far as strategic planning in this area is concerned. Maureen Lister from Aged Care Australia&mdash;an organisation which represents the church, charity and community group sector and provides most of the hostels and about 45 per cent of all nursing home beds&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly for the majority of pensioners there will be no requirement for them to pay an accommodation bond at all, and entry to an aged care facility will be based entirely on the care need.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what this is all about. It is not about focusing on beds and funding beds and physical infrastructure; it is about the need of the aged citizens in our community when they are assessed as needing nursing homes care. We want to fund the need rather than the bed. Maureen Lister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've had entry contributions in the hostel system for some ten years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">remember, introduced by Labor&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I don't believe that residents of hostels would ever say that there's been any discrimination against their admission on the basis of the amount of assets that they've had.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That debunks the argument that the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga, has proposed in her amendment to this bill. Maureen Lister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will be able to see quite significant improvements in the buildings of nursing homes, and everyone knows that that's gravely needed.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2935">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In another quote, the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association Ltd commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall the new aged care legislation delivers incentives for aged care service providers to strive for continuous improvement in care standards and upgrade accommodation standards.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aged Care Structural Reforms guarantee a better system of residential care under an accreditation and quality assurance system that will allow for vast improvements in aged care under a spirit of competition. No such competition or incentive to better accommodation prevails under the existing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Probably the most interesting comment in this debate since the budget last year came from the former Keating minister, Gary Johns, who admitted that the coalition's reform makes sense and that it is an entirely fair policy. His endorsement was, again, a rebuttal of the arguments that have been put forward since the budget last year by the shadow minister. In fact, it was from Gary Johns's letter to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  `Fair deal on nursing home payment' that I quoted earlier in my address when I referred to the debate that took place when the Hawke government wanted to introduce an assets test on pension applicants over the age of 70 years. I will quote again from Gary Johns letter to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  in supporting the coalition's aged care reform package. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Hawke government's imposition in 1983&hyphen;84 of the assets test on over&hyphen;70 pensioner applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the principle is the same: just as Labor argued that former prime minister Sir William McMahon should not get a pension, why should Kerry Packer be able to enter a nursing home for free?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why indeed? That is basically what this is all about. Is the Labor Party arguing that, were Kerry Packer to go into a nursing home, the taxpayers of Australia pay for it? Is that what the Labor Party is arguing? Maybe the member for Jagajaga should comment on that particular point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope, in my contribution to this debate tonight, that I have made it a little bit clearer&mdash;as I have been doing in my electorate, because of the scaremongering of the Labor
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Party&mdash;to people in my electorate exactly how the system is proposed to work and how fair it really will be. When you quietly and sensibly explain that to people, they readily accept that there is no opportunity for a free ride on the back of the taxpayer in this country, that there should not be middle&hyphen;class welfare in this country, and that people who have means to pay their way&mdash;and Australians are reasonable people&mdash;do expect to pay their way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They expect, if they are down on their luck and things are not going so well, that some of their mates might give them a hand. We are not opposing that. That will be provided. That is what the means test and the income test is all about. This is a very fair package as far as that is concerned, even though it might be complicated. Australians are very conservative when it comes to change. This is a lot of change and it is going to take time for them to get to understand exactly how this is going. But when it is explained to people, they accept that it is very fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the moments remaining, I want to talk about a situation that arose in my electorate under the former Labor administration with regard to getting nursing home beds in my area. What happened to these beds is still the great mystery of one part of my electorate&mdash;they seemed to disappear into the ether. On 1 July 1994, the chairman of the board of directors of the Lower North Coast Area Health Service wrote to me on behalf of his organisation and the broader community generally. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Board of Directors are concerned with the shortfall of nursing home and hostel beds in our local District when compared to the Commonwealth Department of Health formula.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They provided a table which showed that the area health service was 45 nursing home beds short, according to the Commonwealth formula, and 164 hostel beds short. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that in relation to this last figure, account has not been taken of the proposed 60 bed hostel at Forster&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which has subsequently been completed by Baptist Community Services in July 1994. The Commonwealth Department of Human
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2936"> Services and Health advertised that recurrent funding was available for the provision of new and additional hostel, nursing home and community care services. Target areas published included a nursing home priority for the Great Lakes area. Bear in mind that this was three years ago. The advertisement indicated that there was a need for an allocation of 30 nursing home beds in the Great Lakes area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two organisations from that area, both of which had established infrastructure&mdash;Great Lakes Aged and Invalid Care Association and also the Baptist organisation&mdash;applied for those 30 nursing home beds. The Baptist organisation has a brand new hostel facility which is called Kularoo Gardens, which is bigger than the other facility. It also has the facilities and infrastructure to accommodate the nursing home beds that the Commonwealth Department of Health advertised for back then. The closing date for the applications came and went. I supported both applications because, if the department had been of a mind to allocate the nursing home beds to either of those organisations, it would have been a welcome and needed addition to the services in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the surprise of the entire community, only 20 beds&mdash;after 30 were advertised&mdash;were allocated to a company based in Inverell in the electorate of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and nowhere near the Great Lakes area in my electorate, and that company had no infrastructure in the Great Lakes area. That seemed extremely strange to us. We had great problems trying to find out what decision making process had taken place within the department and by the then Labor government. We subsequently found out that the Inverell company tried to relocate the nursing home beds to Coffs Harbour&mdash;remember, they were allocated to the Great Lakes area&mdash;and then tried to relocate them 450 kilometres north of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the approval for that relocation was not forthcoming from the department, the 20 nursing home beds disappeared and have not been seen since. I tried to find out where those beds were from the minister of the day, but could not find any information at all.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Now, again, there has been an advertisement for 30 nursing home beds in the Great Lakes area by the Department of Health and Family Services. Hopefully, one of those two organisations, which I am sure have applied for those beds, will be allocated them because they are ready to go. They will provide caring aged care for the seniors in the community in the Great Lakes area in my electorate, contrary to what the member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister, is alleging is going to happen under our proposed aged care reform of having three different classes of aged care in Australia. It won't happen. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aged Care Income Testing Bill 1997 is designed to establish an administrative procedure to support the implementation of the income testing arrangements that are part of the reforms for aged care announced in the last budget. At the outset, let me say that I have had few problems with the thrust of the changes which the government has in mind. With an aged population above the age of 60 expected to be about a quarter of the national population by the year 2020, it is obvious we cannot have an open&hyphen;ended public provision of aged care facilities, despite the fact that a vast majority of people have paid their taxes all their lives and may well ask why they should not enjoy a totally or substantially publicly subsidised aged care accommodation; but we cannot afford it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see the nursing home fee reform that will be assessed through this preliminary bill as a way of restoring the sadly declining nursing home infrastructure in this country, especially in smaller communities where the client can stay within his or her community, where aged care staff can remain and the aged person does not need to travel away from their local district. I hope that is one of the results of this new approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the value of aged care accommodation bonds will not be classed as deemable financial assets for the purpose of income testing, while at the other end of the scale those who cannot afford to contribute over and above the basic fee will not be asked to do so. Every residential care facility will be required to set aside a minimum number of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2937"> places for those who cannot pay, while current occupants of a nursing home will not be asked to pay a bond in respect of that nursing home. These are welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud these assurances within the proposed aged care legislation that will follow this income testing bill, as I do the government's undertaking to put in place prudential arrangements to ensure accommodation bonds are protected. I applaud, too, the setting up of the Aged Care Standards Agency, to come into effect from 1 January next year, which will monitor the resident charging practices in the industry. That is only just when we are dealing with the savings and assets of the frail aged who are anxious enough about their circumstances and situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My major concern is just what, if any, cap is placed on the size of entry fees to nursing homes. At the moment, looking at the draft bill, there are no provisions for any cap and, as it stands, a nursing home could charge whatever are the client's assets, less the 2&half; times the basic aged pension entitlement, currently about $22,500, leaving the accommodation bond open ended. That is the way I am reading it. In fact, the minister's office has confirmed this. There is no cap as such, I am told. It is more of a reverse cap in that the users must be left with at least 2&half; times the pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is all very well, but I certainly do not regard that as a sufficient cap. Surely we do not expect the well off to donate all their assets to their nursing home to invest on behalf of that business because at the moment the bonds appear to be that open ended. There must be a cap and a scaling of bonds depending on means and the absolute assurance that the financially disadvantaged have the same access and level of service as any other client. In other words, there must be absolute and firm regulation of this industry, otherwise it will exploit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are clear, though: the nursing home industry is in a state of infrastructure crisis. The Gregory report highlighted the parlous state of the industry when it pointed out that 75 per cent of homes need fixing or rebuilding to meet Australian design stand
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ards, 70 per cent of homes need fixing or rebuilding to meet Commonwealth standards, 13 per cent do not meet fire standards, and 39 per cent of residents are in rooms with four or more beds. As well, the report identified poor wheelchair and frame access, no grab rails, inadequate ramps, multi&hyphen;storey buildings without lifts and insufficient heating or cooling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is right when it says it has inherited a time bomb because, like it or not, the aged care industry is the major growth industry facing Australia in the next 20 years or so. We are not in a position to meet the demand unless we access more funding. It would be great if our government&mdash;and that before&mdash;was bold enough to tackle the big issue, that is, taxation, for there could be ample revenue from what is now avoided tax to fund a large proportion of this aged care infrastructure. There is also a responsibility, for those who can, to pay for what at the end of the day amounts to their accommodation and health care&mdash;something those of us who are able must do at other stages of our life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure an open&hyphen;ended bond system is not the intention of government because no elderly person would accept such an open&hyphen;ended fee. There must be a cap and I presume that will be detailed in the so called `users' rights principles' still to be released by the minister. I am told the users' rights principles will be tabled some time before the budget and circulated for discussion. I believe these principles should have been made available with the draft aged care bill and that draft bill should have been made available long before submissions on it were due to close, because the users' rights are essential to understanding what the government's aged care bill and in fact its whole aged care strategy is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reform appears to have been rushed through rather than there having been the wide consultation the minister suggests has occurred because, as I said earlier, there are big grey areas that are causing concern to not only the aged but to aged care providers and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has been labouring this point for many months and has been accused of scaremongering. But, until the users rights
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2938"> principles are detailed, no&hyphen;one can be comfortable with either the aged care income assessment procedures or the draft Aged Care Bill because they are both asking the frail aged to take the government on trust. If elderly people will not accept an open&hyphen;ended charging scheme, and they will not, then the scenario painted by the Central West Aged Care Assessment Team that I met recently&mdash;the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has a copy of the document&mdash;will become a reality. This team, made up of aged care professionals, tells me that old people will dig their heels in and refuse to take up accommodation bonds. The home and community care system will be unable to cope and we will have, potentially, an unholy disaster in aged care in this country if we are not careful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment we are, however, debating a bill for aged care income testing to lay the groundwork for the government's users who can pay for aged care reforms. This bill will enable the Department of Social Security to have the necessary lead time to assess the income and assets of existing clients of the nursing home system. I only wish there had been sufficient lead time for the aged themselves to absorb the ramifications of the changes these reforms will have on them. From the August budget or a bit before to now is not long enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a period of anxiety for the aged in care facilities and those others who might soon be looking at the prospect of entering a nursing home. They are being assessed for payments they know little about. There is an understanding that the users pay principle should be applied to aged care if possible. Most Australians do not have problems with the concepts of equity and fairness. I only wish the kind of backup planned after the introduction of this and the subsequent aged care legislation had been in place before the bills were introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred earlier to what I see as a lack of consultation and information with the aged care industry in my electorate and, I believe, elsewhere in regional New South Wales at least. I had discussions with the minister over this issue after a recent grievance debate
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contribution I made on the matter. I pointed out that copies of the aged care draft had not arrived on my desk and certainly were not available to aged care providers or assessment teams in the central west of New South Wales until days before submissions were due and only after I had chased up several scarce copies. The minister did apologise for this and agreed to receive a late submission from the Central West Assessment Team on several aspects of the Aged Care Bill&mdash;and for that I am grateful; I notice that the minister is in the House and I thank her for that courtesy&mdash;including these income testing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me list some of the concerns from the Central West Home and Community Care Forum. It points out that clients who may have the financial resources to pay an entry contribution may actually decline placement after the assessment of their liability under the provisions of the aged care income testing legislation. If they refuse entry because they feel they do not wish to contribute to their care in such a fashion, not only will they place further pressure on already stretched home and community care services but, with dementia care counselling also being shifted under the wing of home and community care, those resources are likely to be stretched even further. I am told HACC providers are frequently confronted with very at&hyphen;risk clients who refuse residential placement and the payment of an entry contribution will exacerbate this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the Standards Agency will indeed monitor those other areas of concern that have been outlined to me and the minister from the Central West Aged Care Assessment Team such as the availability of the same standards of care and accommodation for all, be they the top contributors or the pensioners only&mdash;the sorts of occupants with no bond. Also I am told that there is concern about those who are not aged but have to access nursing home accommodation because of early middle age dementia or physical or mental handicaps and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There must be a temptation for the provision of deluxe care for the higher contributors, and I would want this area to be closely monitored. I am also aware that the Uniting
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2939"> Church is on the record as dismissing the government's estimate that the average accommodation bond will be about $26,000. Some reports suggest the average could climb as high as $80,000. This is interest&hyphen;free money, we must remember, a long&hyphen;term loan which will generate income for the holder&mdash;the aged care provider&mdash;so we must be sure the money is used for the improvement of those aged care facilities. It is not good enough to simply allow the size of the entry contribution to be negotiated between the resident and the proprietor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when the aged care assessment team have recommended the nursing home option, we must not have in place a system that allows for protracted haggling over entry contributions when the would&hyphen;be client is under enormous stress because of the move from the community to the institution. The bond, or contribution, must be set beforehand according to a fair formula. It must not be a leverage for the nursing home company to extract maximum investment opportunities from individuals on a case by case basis. The drawdown of $2,600 a year for five years is not the point and nor is the return, without interest, of the unused entry contribution to the person or their family. It is the level of contribution and how it is used that concerns me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other area of aged care that also concerns me both with regard to this bill and with regard to the Aged Care Bill to follow is the situation regarding occupants of nursing home type beds in smaller country hospitals. Will there be any requirement for aged occupants of these facilities to pay more than the current 85 per cent of their pensions? What about the aged care nursing home type patients in the Molong, Cudal, Canowindra and Eugowra hospitals? These are not multipurpose services and thus are not categorised as nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While multipurpose service programs have got under way in some towns, it seems this nursing home status for most smaller hospitals is a long way off. I understand the federal government has called a halt to the program because of concerns in country communities that they are about to lose possession of their
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aged hostel assets. In parts of New South Wales, the NPS system&mdash;which I believe, if properly managed, could very well be the answer to aged care in small communities&mdash;is being looked at with hostility because there is a feeling that the state government wants to grab community owned assets and moneys and force hostels into amalgamation with rural hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government must speed up the establishment of multipurpose centres but must insist, as a prerequisite to any subsidy, that those local assets remain in some form of community control. Having said that, the existing public hospital de facto nursing home system could well be swamped by old people lining up to get into this alternative nursing home system if people refuse to pay the increased fees or bonds. State governments can legitimately ask whether, until a federal&hyphen;state community multipurpose service is in place, they will be required to take on a greater aged care responsibility. Will there be a cost shift from federal to state in this area without any form of capital back&hyphen;up from the federal government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accommodation bonds and increased fee structure could be a win&hyphen;win for the standard of aged care in smaller communities and the economic stimulus health care offers such communities. It could also be a win for the clients who can remain in their communities. But the reforms to aged care must embrace those smaller de facto nursing homes in country hospitals or they will not be able to cope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions of this specific enabling legislation are fair and adequate as far as they go. But the process of income assessment will begin for existing nursing home patients long before the details of the government's aged care reforms have really filtered down to that aged community. There are dangers ahead in this reform program for the government, and I urge the minister to carefully read the concerns of aged care providers and the elderly in country and regional areas because they feel they have had less than adequate input.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition amendment leaves the inadequate existing system as it is. There is  a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2940"> crisis in nursing home accommodation and care in this country. There is already an economy, business and first&hyphen;class system in place, as alluded to in that amendment. We have to try and even out those inequalities and we need money to do it. Unfortunately, we are asking the aged to contribute in varying degrees which, in many cases, will see their assets cashed up to provide this care and accommodation. As the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) pointed out in an earlier speech, if she had to relocate from Adelaide to Melbourne she would have to sell up and refinance her new position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issue facing this government is the problem I pointed out yesterday in reference to the superannuation surcharge. This income testing bill is part reform but also part of the grab for more revenue. In effect, it becomes a tax like the super surcharge&mdash;a tax on the elderly who have paid taxes all their lives and who never expected to be slugged so hard towards the end. But, as I said, most understand that and will also accept a `users who can pay' principle with provision for those who cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My message to the government is: you have broken your promise of no new taxes. Why do you not do the job properly now, break the big promise and undertake a total review of tax in this country? Let us look at wholesale sales tax and value added consumption tax, but especially a tax on those areas now taxed so slightly that it is a joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody out there who is regarded as a battler by this government, and by the opposition, knows it is a joke, because while people of means are escaping their tax dues in this country&mdash;and out of this country, in fact&mdash;the retired are being asked to make sacrifices, as they will, when the revenue missed from tax could fund the aged care system on a more subsidised basis than our current tax take allows. But that is not going to happen, I do not believe&mdash;in the short term, anyway. Meantime, our nursing homes are run down, in need of an urgent injection of funds that government cannot or will not find because of an obsession with the deficit black hole and its spinelessness on tax reform.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On balance, I will be supporting the government's aged care bills&mdash;both this and the one for accommodations bonds&mdash;because I believe they will maintain the viability of the aged care delivery to rural communities, particularly, provided community hostel assets do remain locally owned, provided multipurpose services are established, provided there are caps on bonds, provided the income assessment of the aged is handled with sensitivity and provided there is more consultation with aged care deliverers and the aged in my electorate. I reserve the right, if I see this system as causing distress over the next few weeks, to lobby members of the Senate to amend this bill and the Aged Care Bill that will follow. I would prefer the government to delay these reforms of aged care to allow longer consultation, but that is not likely. With all those many reservations I have outlined, I support this legislation at this stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

She keeps attacking a bill which was made in exceptionally difficult and tight fiscal circumstances and accepts no responsibility for her government's actions in bringing us to this state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I say today will be short, because I know that I will be given a further opportuni
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2941"> ty in this House to discuss the actual substantive bill. Let us be clear that this is only the income testing bill, which shows the vision of the minister. We are putting this into place now so that in June&hyphen;July, when the substantive bill comes into effect, things flow smoothly. Residents will already be aware of who is going to be affected and who will fall into that 30 to 35 per cent of people who cannot afford to pay and will not be asked to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is reasonable, in this era of high unemployment, when we have a health system which is falling down around our ears, when we are short on education, with a $10 billion hole to pay back, that we ask the aged to contribute to their maintenance. It is predicted that, by the year 2030, 19 per cent of our population will be over 65. That is the equivalent of four million Australians currently in Australia. Think about there being four million Australians over 65 in Australia today. There are only eight million people who are employed and paying tax. That is an incredible burden for my generation to bear when it comes to the year 2030.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not want a situation where the gulf between the generations widens and the younger generations see the aged as a burden. We are simply extending to nursing homes the policy that the Labor Party introduced to the hostels. The other scaremongering going on is that people are saying it will cost up to $80,000 to enter a nursing home. If you want to pay that much for a nursing home, you will get gold&hyphen;plated taps, jacuzzis and shag pile carpet. But not all of us wish to live in that standard of accommodation. Given share market forces, we estimate, quite realistically, that the prices will be around $26,000, which is about what they are paying for hostels at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, it is Labor's misinformation which keeps this issue alive, and it is upsetting numerous aged people in my electorate. When I speak to them, they say, `Oh, is that what it means? That's fair.' This bill is about identifying people early on by allowing the Department of Social Security and the Department of Health and Family Services to crosscheck their references to come up with incomes that will crystallise the identification of those who
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be asked to make some contribution towards their care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After wages, mortgage, the cost of food, utilities and tax have been taken from the people of Lindsay, by and large they are left with very little more than six per cent in disposable income. Heaven help them if they also want to run a car, pay school fees and other essentials that go with the period of life prior to age 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are simply asking the aged to make contributions to those assets when they are in an environment where their utilities, tax, mortgage and food are taken care of and they have absolutely nothing to worry about for the remainder of their days. One of their biggest concerns will be who their neighbour is at lunch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important thing&mdash;and I will get to this when we come to the substantive bill&mdash;is the burden placed on young people who will have to work in aged care homes. Prior to my election to this House, I had never visited a nursing home. When I did, it astounded me to learn of the level of labour required to maintain services to the aged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the year 2030, when 19 per cent of people will be over 65, a greater proportion of those under 65 will have responsibility for the care and sustenance of those in nursing homes. It is a major problem which is brought about by the dreadful financial difficulties in which we currently find ourselves. It is all very well to say, `Oh, you're attacking the aged again,' but right across the board we have taken funds from all areas to repair our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 March 1996 our nation was at death's door. The lifeblood was bleeding from this country, with high levels of unemployment, huge Commonwealth debt, huge foreign debt and a health system which was overtaxed, with enormous waiting lists. People had no vision of the future for their generation, let alone for their children's generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have come into that scenario and, instead of providing aged care absolutely free, as we would love to do, at the gold taps, jacuzzis and shag pile carpet level, we have
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2942"> realised that we as a nation cannot afford it. We must be responsible in these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the minister on having the vision to put this act in place before the substantive bill comes on. It has been meticulously planned. It has been achieved in a very short period&mdash;within the space of our entry into government and within the first budget period. The urgency of the problem was obvious, given the fiscal problems we were left with. I congratulate the minister most wholeheartedly on her efforts to date, and I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking in opposition to this bill, the Aged Care Income Testing Bill. It comes as a bit of a shock to me to learn that the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) believes that this is a revenue measure, or in some way is going to overcome the government's deficit problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I need to make an apology at the very beginning of my speech because in my electorate&mdash;I am not sure about yours&mdash;my constituents have suffered a lot. An amount of $100,000 of their superannuation is going to be ripped from them when they retire. Child-care charges have been upped. Labour market programs have been destroyed. The government has played wedge politics and tried to marginalise Aboriginals and migrants in my electorate. There is no industry policy. As for helping small business to export, they have cut revenue there. Education has been a disaster, and we put much store in my electorate on educating our young. Mr Deputy Speaker, my apology is made because of all the horrible measures done by the government, I find this one the worst. This is a measure done by a ruthless minister in a heartless government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to respond to a few things that have been said. Firstly, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and the member for Lindsay have said, `All we are doing is extending Labor's hostel program into nursing homes.' I want to make this qualification. I am not trying to suggest that our scheme was perfect either in relation to hostels or in relation to nursing homes but the minister and the member for Lindsay get up here and say,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `All we are doing is borrowing your system in hostels and applying it to nursing homes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a canard! People choose to go into hostels but you cannot get into a nursing home unless you are medically assessed by an aged care assessment team. There has to be an assessment. No member of parliament can use influence to get people into a nursing home unless they are assessed as being required to go into a nursing home. Why wouldn't there be a difference in a system where you choose to go into accommodation compared to one where you have no choice, where you are assessed as requiring the facilities of a nursing home? This is repeated ad nauseam and it is a lie, a bald lie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indebted to the Minister for Family Services, Mrs Moylan, because today I got a response to a question I had placed on notice. The first question I asked was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the (a) average upfront fee paid by new residents and (b) level of demand or waiting list size for each hostel in each State and Territory owned and operated (i) for profit, (ii) by government and, (iii) by community and religious organisations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you are anticipating a very fulsome answer because what the minister and the member for Lindsay has said is, `We are just extending the hostel system into nursing homes.' What was the response? It was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Entry contributions are refundable deposits negotiated between resident and the provider. They are private arrangements and for this reason the government does not collect administrative information from them. The government does not collect information on hostel waiting lists which are essentially a private administrative concern of the hostels.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If we are transferring this system from hostels to nursing homes, what the minister is clearly indicating is that not only does she have no information about hostels but where is the proposal to collect the information on nursing homes under the new regime? My second question was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has her Department developed an affordability index for intending hostel residents; if so, (a) what is it and (b) how was it developed; if not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will believe that she, having flunked the first
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2943"> question, will be spot on in the second, but let me read you the answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government does not collect information on entry contributions paid&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">they have not got a clue what the variations are&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and does not have an affordability index for such contributions because they are private arrangements between the provider and the consumer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So they do not know. That is what they are really saying: they do not know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In hostels, part of the requirement of course is that they provide beds for financially disadvantaged. It is a condition of getting a licence. There are some people who do not pay an up&hyphen;front fee to go into a hostel. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, just keep on remembering this point: people choose to go into hostels as a more convenient and appropriate living arrangement, whereas nursing homes are compulsory; you get assessed when you go in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry knows, if the minister does not know, that all that the government is setting is a minimum requirement for an entry into a nursing home&mdash;$26,000. But the industry knows that proprietors, particularly proprietors for profit, the employers of the former Senator Woods, for example&mdash;well connected to the Liberal Party&mdash;can charge what the going rate is. I am surprised the member for Lindsay did not say, `Oh, well, of course, if there are two people in a family home, we're going to make sure that they don't have to sell the family house.' You did not say it. I thought you would have run that argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe the member for Lindsay understands the situation where one spouse, one partner, of an aged couple&mdash;usually grandparents&mdash;is faced with the advice from her doctor and from the ACAT team that her partner needs to go into a nursing home and she starts the ring&hyphen;around and wants to get her partner placed in one and she cannot find one of those free beds, the beds where you do not have to pay an up&hyphen;front fee. What the proprietors will say is, `Well, look, I'm sorry, we haven't got one. But, you know, if you're able to pay $30,000 or if you're able to pay $40,000, a bed will be available.' Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you: what would you do in that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> situation? Would you choose to keep your partner at home, knowing the doctor and the ACAT team have said, `This person is best placed in a nursing home. That is where they will get the most appropriate care'? What would you do? I think I know, Mr Deputy Speaker: you would sell your house because you care for your loved one and you will put them in the nursing home. That is what this government is doing to the frail aged in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lindsay got one thing right&mdash;about the growing numbers of people that will need nursing home care. Even this draconian system may have some justification if we could argue that there would be a provision of extra nursing home places. But under this legislation there is not going to be one extra nursing home bed: not one as a result of this legislation, not one with all the up&hyphen;front fees that will be collected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had some recent family experience with nursing homes. You usually cannot get your relative into the nursing home of your choice initially. If you keep on moving that relative, you keep on having to provide up&hyphen;front fees and if you do not you will not get a place, you will not get them in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that I find absolutely outrageous is that the minister cannot tell us. We know what is going to happen with those nursing home up&hyphen;front fees, particularly in those nursing homes run for profit: it will go down into the bottom line. They will be collecting the interest on it, drawing down the $2,600 every year for five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But who is going to pay the income tax? That is not clear. What a double whammy! You have to sell your home, get your partner into a nursing home and pay your up&hyphen;front fee. The nursing home is being operated for profit, the proprietor pockets the money, improves his bottom line and, of course, you are stuck with paying the tax on the interest earned. I hope that the parliamentary secretary at the table will clear this matter up. Maybe I am wrong. But it is unclear to me and unclear to a lot of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have talked tonight about those who either have the financial capability or who are forced to sell the family home. But what
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2944"> about the pensioners like the pensioners I saw on Sunday during Senior Citizens Week? What a lovely present they have. What a lovely present to have this delivered by a government. What does someone in a housing commission home do? Let us say they are a single person and they have been assessed by their GP to go into a nursing home and they have been assessed by the ACAT team as requiring nursing home accommodation. They cannot bribe the proprietors to get a bed; they just do not have the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you what is going to happen. Increasingly, we are going to see in Australia our frail aged being put with their families. There will be assessments; they will require a nursing home; there will be no nursing home places; and they are going to stay with a relative. In a goodly percentage of those cases we are going to see an increase, because of this government, in granny abuse by relatives frustrated by their inability to deliver the levels of care required by their relatives staying at home who really need a nursing home bed. We are going to see granny abuse increase on a scale that we have not seen before. If you think I am scaremongering, this is what senior citizens were telling me on Sunday when they were expressing their concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) is at the table. Let me tell you something else that I was told on Sunday that absolutely horrified me. It upset me no end. I can understand where they are coming from because, when you get to be of some age, you do not want to be a burden on anyone. You do not want to be a burden on your family or on your neighbours. The one thing you do want in your old age is a degree of dignity. But what one senior citizen said to me on Sunday was that couples now are making suicide pacts because they can see that they are never going to be able to afford a nursing home bed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a great irony in this parliament, when we have seen the Andrews bill go through the Senate preventing euthanasia, that indeed we have a heartless government and a ruthless minister. Some of the aged people in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> my electorate and, I am sure, in other electorates are now considering suicide as a way of avoiding the changes to nursing home charges. I think that is an absolute tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government members love to rubbish our system of nursing home care. As I said to you, I do not particularly defend it. I am always keen to listen and learn and see what we can do to improve things. I accept that some changes need to be made, but under Labor it did not matter whether you were a millionaire, it did not matter whether you were on a fancy salary, and it did not matter whether you were just a pensioner: if you were assessed as requiring nursing home accommodation, in you went straightaway&mdash;first come, first served on a needs basis&mdash;no up&hyphen;front fees and no special favours. We are replacing this with this draconian system that is going to see aged couples forced to sell the family home. No wonder people are calling this an inheritance tax. No wonder people are calling this an early death duties tax. They are going to be forced to sell the family home to get their partner in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other point that I wanted to make&mdash;90 per cent of people who are actually in nursing homes do not have a spouse. Their spouses have pre&hyphen;deceased them. It is quite clear under the legislation that, if your partner has died before you and you are there on your own, you most definitely do have to sell your family home. Of course, overwhelmingly these people are women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just recently we celebrated International Women's Day and I think lots of us rejoiced at all the progress we have been able to see in this century as we head into the next. But what is this government doing? It is ensuring that those women are going to have to pay varying entry fees, but inevitably will be selling the family home. I am sure they want to leave something for their kids and I am sure they want to leave something to their family. But we are ripping into these women, who are, apart from newborn babies, probably the most vulnerable in our community. No wonder I take such great exception to all the exceptional hurt this government has delivered in my electorate. This is why I take such great exception to these measures.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2945">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that there are some constitutional questions about the way the government is going about this. There is a suggestion that this up-front fee is in fact a tax. I do not want to quote all of the argument that goes with suggesting that this is a tax, but there are a number of cases&mdash;such as Matthews v. Chicory Marketing Board, and General Practitioners Society in Australia and Others v. the Commonwealth of Australia&mdash;that would establish that this government is imposing a tax. The area of unconstitutionality would be this: if these charges are indeed a tax and the up-front fee is variable but does not relate to the level of care that the individuals are receiving, then this legislation can be thrown out under the constitution. I do not normally say this about legislation, but I would love to see this thrown out by the High Court as unconstitutional, because it is discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lindsay says that this is an example of `share market forces'. I think she meant market forces actually, but I do not think she could have got it more wrong. Proprietors cannot create more beds. They have to be licensed to do so. There is nothing in this legislation that increases the number of available beds. The only way standards of nursing homes can be lifted at the moment is by inspections, and a so-called standards body is to be set up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I for one would say that I would not mind a little competition between nursing homes so there is an incentive to lift standards and so there is an incentive to improve services. I think that might be a healthy thing. I think that is something the parliament needs to look at. But I want to finish on this note: not one extra nursing home bed is created by this legislation, but you are guaranteed that people will have to sell their houses and that there will be more granny abuse. I am horrified by what a constituent said at the weekend that some are considering suicide. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I sought service in public life because I had an agenda which had been frustrated by the previous government and which I carried into the presidency of the Australian Medical Association. One item on that agenda was a more logical and sustainable financing system
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for aged residential care and a vision of where it ought to be 20 years from now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not often come into the House to speak on bills with which I do not agree, but I can assure you that I enthusiastically support the Aged Care Income Testing Bill. I say to the member for Chifley (Mr Price) that I hope there will come a time when, instead of each of us on the Labor side and on our side, the Liberal side, constantly try to score political points off one another, we just sit back and look at the long-term future and where things are going to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 10 February, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) released the exposure draft of the Aged Care Bill. It proposes a restructure of the existing programs funded under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954. It brings us into a new residential care system. As a package, these measures set in place a sustainable system of financing the residential care of frail, older Australians into the next millennium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As age dependency ratios rapidly change and the number of us relying on government support increases, these historic changes also herald a change in cultural expectations. Those who can afford to do so will be required to make a financial contribution towards their own residential care so that the standards under which everybody currently lives may be gradually improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just suggest to the member for Chifley and others, in the context of politics, to consider this. At the moment about 13 per cent of us are over the age of 65. By the year 2050, it is estimated by the ABS, about a third of us will be over the age of 65. Eight per cent of us over the age of 75 currently suffer from dementia in the absence of a cure. It is estimated by Professor Bob Officer in the National Commission of Audit report released last year that, over the next 40 years, we will have to spend 10 per cent of this nation's productivity on the health and welfare costs of ageing above and beyond present levels and above and beyond real growth from those levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment there are 5.3 Australians in this country between the ages of 15 and 64  for every person under the age of 15 and over
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2946"> the age of 64. The age dependency ratio, as it is known, is currently 5.3 to one. It is estimated that over the next 40 years, based on our current and reasonable life exceptions, that ratio will go to 2.6 to one. According to the ABS, last year there were 7.8 million people in Australia who worked and generated income upon which they were taxed. In contrast, there were 6.2 million people in Australia relying on some form of social security&mdash;1.2 million of them dependants. Within the next decade, in the absence of changing Australia's cultural expectations, apart from anything else, those trend lines are likely to cross.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government introduced some very good and very sensible reforms for hostel care in 1988, the main consequence of which&mdash;upon which these proposals are modelled&mdash;was a substantial increase in the standards of hostels in which people lived. We are now trying to apply those very same principles to the entire aged residential care industry. This is about vision. It is not very often that that word can be used to describe the things that governments do. It is about having the courage to do what is right and what is not necessarily popular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I were a political opportunist in opposition, this is the kind of issue that I would love to embrace because it is easy to manipulate and frighten people who are vulnerable and scared. It is even easier to frighten people who have lived for 60, 70 or 80 years with a certain expectation and then you start to change the way in which you finance things. I urge those on the other side so vigorously resisting these measures to transcend their own political self-interest. By all means criticise the detail of what we are doing and help us get to where we need to get 20 years from now, but help us and support us in delivering a better future for all of us as we age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A vital part of this process is the Aged Care Income Testing Bill, which I will now address. This introduces procedures that will allow existing and intending residents not in receipt of Commonwealth income security payments to have their income assessed. In particular, it necessarily allows the Secretary
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the Department of Health and Family Services to delegate functions related to the determination of ordinary income to the secretaries to the departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs. These assessments will determine the level of daily contribution that aged people will be required to pay while resident in a Commonwealth approved aged care facility. The assessments will be reviewable on application and subject to review by the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill enables income assessment to be undertaken and advice of that assessment to be provided to operators of residential care facilities. It is a process piece of legislation and will rely on the future passage of the Aged Care Bill, which, of course, we are all anticipating. Given the circumstances under which elderly people frequently are placed in aged residential care facilities, urgently or semi&hyphen;urgently the Department of Social Security will be required to expediently and accurately provide income assessments to residential providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The substantive income testing provisions upon which alterations to charges and subsidies would be based will be provided for in the Aged Care Income Testing Bill 1997. In providing for an exchange of information between the Department of Health and Family Services, the DSS and Veterans' Affairs, the ordinary income of residents will be determined in anticipation of the passage of the Aged Care Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides that any personal information exchanged cannot be used for any purpose other than that of income testing. It has been developed in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. The income test to be applied is that which is currently used to determine entitlements to pensions and benefits. As such, those already in receipt of social security or veterans pensions will not have to provide additional information unless their circumstances have changed in some way. In other words, the only people who will be affected by this measure are those who are not currently in receipt of a pension, a part pension or a Veterans' Affairs entitlement.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2947">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nine per cent of current nursing home and hostel residents are non&hyphen;pensioners. DSS will undertake assessments for those people to make sure that they are advised of their potential income tested charge as much in advance of 1 July as is possible, hence the necessity of this bill in advance of the Aged Care Bill to provide the prerequisite time for income assessment of non-pensioner residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pensions income test has two principal features. The first is the assessment of income. The second is the assessment of a so-called free area income. Income includes superannuation, war disability pensions, compensation payments and income from real estate and family trusts. This income is added to the income assumed or deemed by the government to be earned from financial assets. The free area is the amount of income a person can have before their level of income starts to have an effect on fees and pensions. The present free area is $49 a week for a single and $86 a week combined income for a couple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Residents receiving the full pension at 1 July will pay no more than the basic pensioner contribution and pay no further income tested charge. Those on a part pension will pay a slightly higher fee unless they have dependent children. All pensioner residents have the right to decline to have their pension income disclosed to the department. However, if they decline, they will not be entitled to a subsidy rate and will have to pay the full fee, up to a maximum of $60 a day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All self&hyphen;funded retirees can, if they choose, refuse to supply details of their income to the department. However, if they so decline to provide such information, they will not be entitled to a subsidy and will pay the full fee of up to $60 a day. If a self-funded resident does agree, they will complete a departmental form and may, if they wish, nominate an agent to deal with the department on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A DSS representative may visit the resident to clarify the information that is provided. At any time the self-funded retiree can ask the department to conduct a new income assessment. Of course, review and appeal rights will apply. DSS will provide a financial informa
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion service officer who, for the cost of a local call, can answer queries about any aspect of income testing or provide information on how to get better returns from financial investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of income testing, it is worth referring to the report of the funding and other implementation issues working group to the Minister for Family Services. The working group comprised representatives of Aged Care Australia, the Alzheimer's Association, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, the ACTU, the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, the Carers Association of Australia, Community Services Australia, the Council on the Ageing and the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals. The group noted and strongly supported the agreement with the department that entry contributions or accommodation bonds would not be classed as deemable financial assets for the purposes of income testing, a very important point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Social Security will provide income testing outcomes for individuals, both pensioners and self-funded retirees, to the Department of Health and Family Services, which will set fees. The Department of Health and Family Services will advise residents and facilities of the fees and benefits that are payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The working group further noted that Department of Social Security assessments for all residents will be appealable to the Department of Social Security and that the income review strategy will be the same as for the pension generally, using established risk assessment criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The group further accepted that the existing DSS separate fee areas for single people and partnered people should be used for the income test for residential care benefits, noting that the existence of income splitting for many couples would outweigh any potential disadvantage arising from application of the married free area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There would be less than 10 per cent of residents for whom an income assessment was not available at the time of entry. The DSS
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2948"> anticipated that income assessments would take a maximum of 28 days, and significantly less in straightforward cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of trying to deal with Australia's future needs in aged care, yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced a package of $600 million for small business, to try to assist small business. That has a lot to do with this, because the people in this country who create wealth, which is taxed, need to work in an environment where it is easier to create the wealth that we require to spend on those who will be in need of aged and other forms of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Chifley and other speakers on the other side have said, this is about changing cultural expectations. It is about making sure that, whoever is in government in the year 2020, we will no longer be in a world, we will have lived through a period&mdash;particularly over the last decade&mdash;where Australians have come to expect that government will be able to provide everything for everybody, and preferably at no cost. And no matter how noble that notion may be, it is simply unsustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If any of us who have actually spent any time at all in a nursing home&mdash;other than visiting one for morning tea and speaking to some of the residents&mdash;and have been to a nursing home, particularly late at night or in the early hours of the morning&mdash;were to ask ourselves, `Is this a place in which I would like to live, where I would be happy to see my mother live?' most of us, I think you will find, on most occasions would actually answer no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forty per cent of people who are living in nursing homes at the moment currently live, for example, in a room that houses at least four people. They live in institutions&mdash;and Bob Gregory identified this in stage 2 of his review of nursing home funding&mdash;on which we have to spend $1 billion today to bring them up to health, fire and outcome standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government had effectively in its last budget committed $12 million for capital upgrading. What we are doing is honestly recognising as a government that in terms of expenditure we cannot continue to indulge the present  generation at the expense
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of our children by spending more than we earn, by maintaining social infrastructure on debt and asset sales; that we have to responsibly get ourselves into a fiscal consolidation program and fund social infrastructure on surplus, as existed until the time of the Whitlam government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst these things are understandably not popular, and it is not popular to say to a section of those in need of aged residential care that they may have to spend a small amount of their income on their own care or spend a small amount of the money which accrues from their assets on their own care, it is something that is absolutely necessary and needs to be responsibly done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1987 under the previous government, no matter what sort of accommodation you received, a nursing home resident, no matter what their financial status, paid no more than 87&half; per cent of the age pension and, on face value, that may seem reasonable. But unfortunately standards had fallen because of the non&hyphen;discriminatory nature of the policy. The previous government had done the right thing in hostel care but, for obvious political reasons, had been reluctant to embrace what is so necessary and was so strongly recommended by Bob Gregory in his review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is introducing means tested accommodation bonds or entry contributions and fees, and each will be paid by those who can afford it. And the moneys raised can be spent only on the upgrading of the facility in which that person resides. It cannot be taken as profit and it certainly cannot be used by government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nursing homes which still generally look after those with the greatest need have had no capacity whatsoever to charge any entry contribution fee up until now. Those who will be not required to pay an accommodation bond include full or part pensioners who have not owned their own home in the past two years and who have assets under $22,500, for singles. Similarly, those who have a spouse or a partner or a carer or dependent child living in the house will be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it may be smart politics, it is mischievous to go out and say to people that they will have to sell their homes. Under the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2949"> hostel system that has worked so well that was implemented by the previous government, about 40 per cent of people have not paid any accommodation bond at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And keep in mind that these are the people who have income; these are the people that have substantial assets. We are saying that you will be required to pay a small amount. And that accommodation bond can be taken as a debt against your estate. It can be paid as a higher weekly, fortnightly or monthly fee. It may not be paid at all. Importantly, the amount of the accommodation bond that is invested will not be taxable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the speakers in this debate have been sincere, whilst I disagree with them, but I say to the members on the other side, `Just hose yourselves down for a minute and just have a listen to what you are saying.' What you are saying is that we have to perpetuate and continue to have a system that provides substandard facilities and care for all Australians, irrespective of their income, so that they may continue to have what in many cases are very large, empty, family homes sitting out in the suburbs. What we are saying is, `Look, some of the money that is a part of that asset you will be required&mdash;or may be required&mdash;to spend on your care, on getting a better care for yourself.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is has just aggrieved me enormously over the years to see people who have considerable assets and, in some cases, significant income&mdash;estimated by Bob Gregory in 1994 to be $238 million a year&mdash;sitting in a nursing home bed in a run&hyphen;down facility, in a five&hyphen; or six&hyphen;bed ward. And then I see a pensioner who has spent the last 20 years of their life before going into that home living in a housing commission flat, with no choice, no income, no capacity to pay whatsoever. And I know that the government cannot afford to look after everybody. So what a responsible government has to do&mdash;any government that is thinking about the future&mdash;is bite this bullet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge the Labor Party now: whenever you return to government&mdash;and the political cycle will turn&mdash;I guarantee you that you will not repeal this measure, if it is implemented. By the time you get into government, every
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> one who lives in an Australian residential care facility will be having a higher standard of living than they enjoy now and will not accept returning to the past. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) will stay and listen to some reality rather than go on with the pap that we have just been hearing. The hypocrisy that has been evident from those opposite in this debate is nothing short of absolutely appalling. We have heard this story about sub&hyphen;standard nursing homes over and over. Let me tell you about them. In 1983, there was someone in a nursing home in Newcastle whose husband was living on dog food because he could not afford to buy food. Why? Because the nursing home charges were being paid for by the husband out of his pension&mdash;the charges above the person's pension. When we brought in standards of nursing home accommodation there was a great hue and cry from the nursing home community&mdash;particularly the private for profit ones&mdash;about it. I did not then hear the now government coming in and supporting the need for quality but also recognising the need for a contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impression people might get from this debate is that the government is somehow going to generate $130 million a year of extra money to help upgrade nursing homes and build new beds. That is absolute nonsense. It is wrong, false, deceitful and a lie; it is everything one can imagine is dishonest in people's perception of politics. What the government is doing is cutting out half a billion dollars of funding for nursing homes and hostels over the next four years. That is what this about. To project the idea that somehow or other this whole concept is going to improve nursing homes is absolutely wrong. It is worse than wrong; it is deceitful and deceptive. And what it is doing to people is attempting to put forward a picture which they know is false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard speaker after speaker talking about conditions you would not put a dog into. Let me tell you folks: it will get worse a long while before it ever gets any better. The fact is, these figures are shonky. Half a billion dollars is being cut out of spending
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2950"> over four years&mdash;$125 million to $130 million a year. So the $130 million of up&hyphen;front fees is needed just to stand still. Anything needed for upgrading and improving will be beyond that. The concept that somehow the $26,000 average will provide new beds is flawed, and we all know that. Because of land and building costs, the cost of a nursing home bed is somewhere between $50,000 and $100,000, depending on where it is&mdash;what state and what region. It probably averages $70,000 a bed, to build and put a new bed on the ground. It probably costs $30,000&hyphen;$40,000 to upgrade a bed. So we are talking about an average fee of $26,000, a drawdown capacity of those up&hyphen;front fees of a maximum of $13,000 and a relatively small number who would not have to pay at all because they have no assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you try and work out how an organisation can find the capital to put up $70,000 to build a new bed, out of two and a half thousand dollars per year for five years, it does not exactly work, unless they get a very large amount in up&hyphen;front fees&mdash;well over $100,000. The interest on that money could provide it. Alternatively, you go to the recurrent fee structure and look at the extra charging capacity over and above pensions&mdash;the one dollar in four for beyond the cut&hyphen;off rate for pensions. So people on either no pensions or very small part pensions are paying very large amounts of recurrent fees to help service that capital outlay. Every new bed that is produced will require and tie up $70,000 of capital, which will need servicing. And we all know that on the current fee structure there will not be enough surplus of those funds to service that kind of capital. So those opposite who keep telling us that this is about making better nursing homes are blatantly lying, and they know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I had a gentleman in 1983 who was buying dog food for himself to live on. When I went through all his affairs, more than half his pension was being paid to a nursing home for his wife. She had been in there for eight years and the fees went up every year, and he was paying it out of his pension. We changed all that. We limited the maximum that nursing homes could charge,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but we also put in capital. And it was absolutely wrong and outrageous to hear the member for Bradfield talk a moment ago about $12 million for upgrading nursing homes and for him to put down what the last government did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me go further, because there are some really interesting stories out there of dishonesty, deceit and breach of faith. It is normal when a new government comes in that they bring in new policies. But it is also normal and required that they maintain existing contracts. I want to read part of a letter from the matron of Maroba Nursing Home in Waratah in Newcastle about a decision by the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) regarding a grant to that nursing home. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am Director of Nursing of a 79 bed nursing home, owned and operated by Islington Baptist Church, which has enjoyed a fine reputation in the community for over 35 years. The Maroba board has always sought to make improvements to the home, to ensure a high standard can be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I can vouch for that. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognising that the needs of Dementia sufferers can be quite different to those of the frail aged, the Board investigated the possibility of establishing a purpose built unit to cater to the needs of these individuals. At the time it was believed that the old style floor plan of the existing wards was not conducive to reducing stress levels in the confused elderly person who did not require specific dementia management. Also the Board set on a course of meeting OH&amp;S requirements in every way it possibly could, and  ended up with a $1 million project.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Needless to say Maroba did not have $1 million sitting in the bank to spend on this development. Assistance was sought from the Federal Government by way of a capital upgrading grant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993 and 1994, Maroba received two capital upgrade approvals in principal which totalled about $500,000, for payment over 10 years. Payment of which did not commence until stage 1 of the work was completed in 1995. The capital funding changes announced in the 1996/97 Budget, ruled that additional recurrent funding under the National Health Act would no longer be available to Nursing Homes if they choose to charge entry contributions from July 1997, which immediately affects Maroba.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What that means is that the previous government's announced grant of half a million dollars to be paid over 10 years in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2951"> annual instalments has been withdrawn. Or they cannot charge up-front fees. In other words, the new milch cow, the new source of revenue, for nursing home upgradings and new beds&mdash;up-front fees&mdash;is not available if the nursing homes keep their grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the most deceitful and disgraceful decision that I have seen in a very long time. An organisation that spends a million dollars on upgrading its facilities based on a half a million dollar grant is then told two years into that grant, `We've changed our policies. If you want to keep the money you cannot charge up&hyphen;front fees.' Yet they are out there talking  about up-front fees as being the great saviour for the nursing home industry. What hypocrisy, what deceit&mdash;and how vicious can you get?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wrote to the minister about this issue back in December and I still have not got an answer. My letter was based on a letter from departmental staff to Maroba which made it absolutely clear that they had a choice&mdash;the money or the box; take your grant over 10 years or take up-front fees. The letter of 3 December last year to Mr Taylor from Jane Halton stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you correctly point out, recipients of additional recurrent funding under the National Health Act will be required to choose between retaining the subsidy or relinquishing it in favour of entry contributions and recurrent subsidy supplements. Recipients of grants under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act will not be required to relinquish or repay grants.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What we have here is that recipients will be required to choose. They already have a contract, in my view. They entered into a building program worth $1 million based on a contract with the government which said that they would give them half a million dollars towards the program payable over 10 years. Two years into it they are told, `The rules have been changed. If you keep on with that grant you can't charge up-front fees.' That is what has happened. For the government to go around talking about the quality of nursing homes and the quality of care and saying that you would not put your dog in them is absolutely outrageous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can go slightly further into this whole question of how this new system is going
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> work&mdash;this wonderful new world where suddenly $130 million a year is available that was not available before. Sure, one can argue that there is some merit in those who can contribute towards the cost of their accommodation in these places doing so, but this is not about that. This is not about those who can afford it contributing. This is about saving half a billion dollars in government spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Bradfield said that we would not rescind it when we come back into government. Why will that be? Because it is locked in. Once spending has been cut, to get half a billion dollars back in one area alone is very difficult. I will tell you what your next trick is going to be. You will probably announce it in the next 12 months. You will announce a new scheme of insurance to prepare for your old age&mdash;a retirement insurance package whereby you start paying up now so you can afford a nursing home bed if you need one. Take the chance. If you think you might have dementia in the family, take out a policy and that way you might not lose your family home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what you will do next. That is your next stunt. Having created the monster, you will suddenly find an answer to it. That ain't no answer, either. These people do not choose to enter nursing homes. We have all heard that. None of us want to go into a nursing home. None of us want any of our family to, but the fact is that some people have to in the same way as some people have to go into hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard the quote tonight about Kerry Packer going into a nursing home for free. If he goes into hospital, do you expect him to pay for half the ward as well? No, you do not. The infrastructure is there. The system we had was operated on a recurrent basis and was means tested. Those with high incomes were paying their recurrent funding as they went. The government was providing part of the infrastructure in the same way as taxpayers provide for part of the roads and a whole range of infrastructure. Nursing homes are part of our social infrastructure. Access was on a needs basis, not on a money basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this does is completely distort and change our whole notion of social responsi
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2952"> bility. What will come next, as I said early, are insurance bonds, insurance schemes. They will say, `Here you are, Mr and Mrs Jones, when you first marry take out a policy and if either of you ever needs a nursing home it will be okay because this will cover it. If you don't, you have wasted the money anyhow.' In other words, this is user pays in advance. The idea that somehow these people have a choice is wrong. We have heard stories about how bad these homes are. Let me tell you: they were a lot worse under coalition governments. We all know that and so does the industry. The fact is that no-one believes this government when it mouths that kind of nonsense. That has been stated over and over again. Certainly from my contacts in the industry that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's go to another example, which I think is an interesting one. There is a privately owned nursing home in Newcastle which the owner is in the process of selling. He is entitled to do so; I have no problem with that. A few weeks ago when I spoke to him about that, 21 people were still looking for placements. A number of those people's families rang me in that period saying that they had rung around all the nursing homes looking for possible locations for their relatives. Some of these people had been in that nursing home for quite some years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the nursing homes have got queues. The letter from Maroba states that it has a queue of 95. It has listed 11 of the people from Learmonth Lodge&mdash;the one that is being closed. They all have to look towards the probability that if a bed became available it would be beyond 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the families are required by every nursing home to essentially state what their circumstances are. They are asked, `Do you have any money? Do you have any houses? What is the situation?' After 1 July there will be an up-front fee for the next bed they find if they have got more than $22,000. In many cases the family members who are involved are grandchildren. In many cases there are very few left in the family. There may be assets; there may not be. The families without any money are desperately worried,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because they believe that it is very likely that they are going to find it very hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the 21 people who are looking for placements are currently nursing home residents. They are all qualified. How are they going to be chosen for a placement? Which ones will get in first? Given the changed circumstances and the cuts in funding, can we really expect nursing homes want to take into account how much money they have got? The families involved in this are going through agony. Most of the people involved do not even know what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When those beds are sold&mdash;I hope they are re-established in Newcastle&mdash;the new people coming into them will have to pay up&hyphen;front fees as well. We have got a nursing home bed which is occupied at the moment. It will be empty after 30 June. The person who had that bed will have gone somewhere else, with an up-front fee. The bed will be located in another facility and the person coming into it will have to pay an up-front fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the things that the government is not talking about. It is trying to pretend that this whole exercise will find fresh extra money to help improve the circumstances, which is absolutely wrong. What this is about is covering up for a shift in our support systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This country has had one of the world's best aged support systems, be it in home and community care, community aged care packages, hostels, or nursing homes. On a visit to England in the middle of last year I spoke to a lot of people in the care industry and in government. They were interested to know about our procedures because they saw us as being one of the world's best at what we are doing, even though the integration of our services still has a long way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the House committee's report on home and community care pointed a long way into the future in these directions. It pointed to a shift in assessment processes and the seamlessness between community care and institutional care. We all saw the way it was going and there was effectively bipartisan agreement on a move towards shifting the funding from bricks and mortar to more of a service base.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2953"> That has been understood for a very long time. We in the industry and in the community sector had understood that and were working that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one anticipated that the government would shift its funding responsibilities by the extent that has been proposed in that last budget. That has absolutely destroyed the improvements to HACC. There have been changes in state and federal government relationships. It will massively undermine the community sector's preparedness to invest in nursing home care. Quite frankly, these charities cannot afford it; they do not have the money. This to them is a caring responsibility, not a financial one. So we are going to see a great shift in the infrastructure provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At some later stage the government will say, `It wasn't our fault. We had to be responsible. We had to look at consolidation. We did not want to pass on debts to our children.' Instead, we will pass on people living in their homes who should not be there, who cannot and are not being supported. The cost to our children and our children's children of these kinds of measures will be horrendous, but most of all the cost to us as a society will be great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You judge a society by how they care for their young and how they care for their old. We were well thought of once. What this government has done is introduce a new paradigm. We no longer care for our old; they care for themselves&mdash;God knows how&mdash;in some way. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not doubt that in the months ahead you and your colleagues will be talking about nursing home insurance policies to help make sure that when you get old enough you do not need to sell the home. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Being the last in what has been a rather lengthy list of opposition speakers on the Aged Care Income Testing Bill, all of whom have both comprehensively and cogently put the case of those on this side, affords me the opportunity&mdash;albeit it somewhat briefly&mdash;to overview the opposition's case on this matter. It is certainly not my intention in that regard to be anything less than brief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is inextricably entwined with the Aged Care Bill, which will be introduced into this place in the foreseeable future. It goes without saying that those on this side of the House are very supportive of any initiatives and proposals to upgrade nursing homes and to eliminate the sorts of problems that have been highlighted by a number of notable academics and industry representatives of the ilk, for example, of Professor Bob Gregory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government had a fairly lengthy and cherished history of ongoing improvement and reform in the area of nursing homes and aged care. We consider this particular bill to be a most inappropriate way of continuing the reform process. It is inappropriate because, in my view, both of the related bills will have seriously adverse impacts on older Australians who need nursing home care and the sort of attention that those in their stage of life require.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills will also have devastating consequences on the way in which aged care is serviced and delivered throughout our society and across this country. These adverse consequences are totally out of any context or proportion with any positives which may be construed as being derived from either of these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will discuss very briefly a couple of the premises on which our opposition to the Aged Care Income Testing Bill is based. Firstly, I turn to the question of health care. As is agreed in a bipartisan way, all Australians&mdash;in particular aged Australians&mdash;need access to affordable quality health care, specifically on the basis of need. That is why the Medicare system was introduced by the Labor government as the then Medibank back in 1974. We do not believe that this bill affords those Australians most in need&mdash;that is, the poorer among the aged community&mdash;the opportunity to gain ready access to affordable quality health care which is delivered on an equitable basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second premise on which those of us on this side are opposed to this bill is based on the fact that this government `initiative' will impact most heavily on those who can least afford to pay. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised, both during the election
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2954"> campaign preceding the March 1996 election and subsequent to that, not to hit the most vulnerable. The welfare of those whom we perceived to be the most vulnerable was never a core promise in the mind of the Prime Minister because he has simply swept away the needs of the most vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, in its administrative essence, affords the Department of Social Security the opportunity to gather information about a nursing home or hostel resident's income, including the incomes of those who are not pensioners, in expectation that the Aged Care Bill 1997 will pass this House at some later time. The intent is to quite legitimately gather data which will be used to calculate how much of the daily charge of up to $64 the resident in a nursing home will be required to pay come 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aged Care Income Testing Bill will again afford the government the opportunity to levy or charge residents in nursing homes potentially a new and higher daily rate at some stage in the future. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), who is in the House this evening, has made the claim that this bill only enables an income assessment to be undertaken. But the point of making that assessment is clearly so nursing home residents may be charged a high daily fee in much the same way that the Medicare levy has been increased by legislation of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question also needs to be asked as to whether the level of the fee will remain fixed at its present rate. It may well go higher. Will the government determine at some future time, as it has with Medicare, to increase this charge? As a bottom line, the minister should offer all Australians an assurance or guarantee on behalf of the government that this charge will be pegged at its current level. Any shirking of that issue and any failure to offer Australian citizens such a guarantee equates to a hidden agenda of future fee rises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern with this charge that those on this side of the House share is that variable fees may well initiate differing standards of service. The shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), who is also in the House this evening, has quite lucidly put the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> analogy of first, business and economy class service. She cited an example in her own presentation earlier on today of some patients being offered orange juice, while those who could only afford cordial would be offered the same. I was thinking much the same in terms of chicken: those who could afford breasts would get breasts, the business class people would get legs, and those who could least afford to pay would get the wings. Those are analogies that merit some consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen those sorts of things happening within the United States of America, having lived with the manager of a nursing home in Kentucky and spent much time at that home. The end result of the scenario I have painted&mdash;rising fees and the potential for the same&mdash;is simply escalating health costs into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a fairly tawdry attempt to shift the cost from the equitably shared arrangement currently pursued by the public health system to a fairly discriminatory tax arrangement on those unfortunate enough to be required to avail themselves of nursing home facilities. In the shadow minister's assessment, they amount to some three per cent of the population of those over 65. That would be a discriminatory charge on those who require entry to a nursing home. Even if you had some form of wealth&mdash;income or assets&mdash;under your belt, any charge would be hard enough. But, if you haven't, it would look like a substandard level of care was heading your way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One cannot really stress vigorously enough the fact that only a small percentage of Australians will be requiring nursing home care. It is particularly necessary and incumbent upon those on our side to stress this because of the fact that the Prime Minister has said, on at least one occasion, that these people have&mdash;to paraphrase him&mdash;`a responsibility to pay back the debt that nursing home residents owe society at large'. Obviously the view on our side is quite the reverse. These people have paid taxes and made a contribution to our great society for many years, so it is incumbent upon us to repay the debt to them&mdash;certainly not vice versa.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2955">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, perhaps, an attempt by the Prime Minister to create some sort of crisis or perceived crisis by saying that of Australia's elderly population. At the very least, it would be considered a derogatory insult to those same citizens. As I have said, it certainly brushes aside the profound commitment that they have made to our great Australian nation throughout their working lives. It is not the Prime Minister's right, role or responsibility to try to portray those people as being on the scrap heap and as being the ones who must repay some sort of ill&hyphen;conceived debt to society at large. These people continue to make a valid contribution to our society by way of advice proffered to those who come within their range. From my own experience, I know how many local volunteer groups revolve around senior citizens without whom, I believe, society would collapse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side are absolutely appalled at any assertion made by any member in this place that those who are among the aged population of our country should be required to repay a debt. I believe that, similar to the superannuation surcharge, it is incumbent upon those opposite to rightly come clean and to, in the Prime Minister's words in regard to that particular legislation, call a spade a spade and call these nursing home charges taxes. This is an additional tax on the existing Medicare levy and a tax on universal health care. This is a tax from a government that was a `read my lips' government&mdash;a `no new taxes' government. In fact, this is the second new tax that we have seen introduced this week by those opposite despite the fact that they have gone to untold lengths to disguise this as a charge on aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our contention that the two bills that I have alluded to represent a double whack for ageing members of this society because they are clearly faced with the prospect of not only an up&hyphen;front nursing home charge but also selling their homes. They also have to face the prospect of a daily charge for aged nursing home care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is somewhat trite for the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) to suggest that there is almost no harm in aged Australians who own homes selling their homes to meet this up&hyphen;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">front nursing home charge rather than, in his words, allowing some empty large dwelling to lie vacant in the suburbs. Clearly, many parents have a strong desire to leave the family home, it being their prime asset, to their children. They do not want to put themselves ahead of their kids' future welfare by being forced to sell their family home, which is often their only major asset, to meet their nursing home needs and to meet the unfair and discriminatory charges that are being placed upon them by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has persisted in her attempts to hide the fact that this is not going to happen&mdash;that no homes will be required to be sold. But she is among the very few people who currently believe that. The member for Jagajaga has put in her submission here earlier today that the media, nursing home proprietors, both private and not for profit, her own department and some of her own party believe that Australians will have to sell their homes. They understand that they will have to do that if they need nursing home care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this is clearly a tax. It is clearly a whack out of the breadbasket of those Australians who can least afford it. It is discriminatory and we believe it should be opposed. I urge members on both sides of the House to do just that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let's be clear about what we are doing here tonight because a lot of debate has focused on a bill which I expect I will introduce into the House tomorrow. The Aged Care Income Testing Bill will allow the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to commence income testing of residents in nursing homes and hostels so that they can be advised by my department, in advance of 1 July 1997, about the level of charges they will face in the event that the Aged Care Bill is passed. It does not pre&hyphen;empt consideration by this House of the Aged Care Bill which, as I have just said, I expect to introduce into this House tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill only enables an income assessment to be undertaken and advice to be provided to residents of the outcome of that assessment.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2956"> It does not enable charges to be increased, nor  does it allow any reduction in the level of Commonwealth subsidies paid under the National Health Act 1953 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954. What it does give is certainty for those residents who currently do not have an income test in place, and there are only around nine per cent of current residents in nursing homes and hostels&mdash;about 11,000 people in total&mdash;to whom this bill will apply. These residents want to know the level of their obligation and providers will also benefit by having certainty. The reality is that residents are more concerned than they need to be, and this is because of the Labor Party's scaremongering on this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are protections in the bill for residents. There are provisions in the bill to ensure that any personal information exchanged for the purpose of income testing is not used for any other purpose, and these provisions have been developed in consultation with the Privacy Commission. We have gone to considerable lengths to ensure that that was carried out. Special protections for war widows and widowers have been built into the bill so they will not pay any more than other people with an equivalent income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The notion that was promoted by the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), that providers will become tax collectors under this bill really is a nonsense. The government does not require that any provider collect money for the government. This government has asked older people to make a fair and reasonable contribution for their care where they clearly have the means to do so. They pay this to the provider for their care and the government will continue to provide subsidies for their care to the provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, consumers prefer that the fees are collected from them rather than government taking decisions on their own behalf. They much prefer to do that. In fact, when the working group was in operation, both the unions and the consumer representatives felt that they would not want that position to be changed. This is consistent with the principle that pensions are inalienable and, therefore,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> direct deduction on income tested fees are precluded. The variable fee system in hostels, which has been in place under the Labor government, already demonstrates the capacity of providers to manage the administration involved in varying amounts from individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, we have seen Labor indulge in its favourite pastime of scaremongering and frightening older Australians that the government's aged care reform package will lead to a two&hyphen;tiered system of aged care and that individuals will be forced to sell their home to gain access to residential care. Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is we now see about 50 per cent of people voluntarily electing to sell their homes because they are going into a permanent form of residential care. For most of them it is quite unrealistic to expect that they will leave their home vacant while they enter a residential care unit option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have given those who have the means a flexible option to be able to pay an accommodation bond. We have said that access to residential aged care will be based on needs, not just on means. So it will be based on what people need, not on how much money they have. Nobody will be forced&mdash;and I repeated that word on a number of occasions&mdash;to sell their home. Of course, they may well elect to because that is the most comfortable and appropriate thing to do to access residential care. We have also said that access to residential aged care by people of limited means will be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's two&hyphen;tiered system of aged care just will not be tolerated. It has existed in the past and we believe that our reforms go a long way towards stamping out that practice of the two&hyphen;tiered system, that the rebuilding of the nursing home sector will be of benefit to everyone who enters residential nursing care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a further step in this government's steps to better care for older Australians. We did inherit a nursing home sector that is in a very bad state. We take the responsibility now to proceed to fix it and to put into place in Australia a sustainable system of aged care in a country where we are facing an increasing number of people over the age of 65.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I was under the impression from material published by the government around the time of the budget that the government is reducing its subsidy to particular nursing homes by the amount that nursing homes collect from nursing home residents. Is that correct?</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MOYLAN" NAMEID="4V5">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PG6">Ms MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a fairly important consideration, obviously, as to whether or not  the money is being collected to replace subsidies previously paid by the government. But I am sure we will talk about that more when we get to the debate about the main bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as today's bill is concerned, in my amendment to the second reading I drew the House's attention to three problems which I just want to raise now. The first is that I would seek the minister's consideration of the need to allow nursing home residents to appoint an agent or somebody to act on their behalf, given that a very large number of nursing home residents are unable to act on their own behalf. I draw the minister's attention specifically to the notice of determination in clause 9 and also to the reconsideration in clause 10(6) where at the moment the bill only says that the secretary has to write to the person whose income has been determined or reassessed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that this is already covered in clause 6(b). The fact is that 90 per cent of residents who are already customers of Social Security or Veterans' Affairs have already had the opportunity to nominate somebody else to manage their affairs. Clause 6 of the bill specifically allows the person acting for or on behalf of a resident to give information so that ordinary income can be determined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill takes privacy very seriously. It is not appropriate to be releasing people's confidential information to anybody else unless that person has been nominated, has a power of attorney or is a legal representative. The income testing form will allow for the person to nominate someone else to act on their behalf.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I read clause 6, that enables the secretary to request information from the person involved or a person acting on behalf of the nursing home resident. The difference is in clause 9 where the department is notifying the nursing home resident of their determination. What flows from that is any determination to charge a fee. It seems to me that it is pretty import
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ant at that time that a similar clause appears in 9 and in 10(6), as in 6, in relation to a person acting for or on behalf of that person, where the determination has been re&hyphen;examined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the minister's point about privacy; I am certainly not seeking to reduce the privacy provisions. But as clause 6 shows, we are dealing with people who in many circumstances will not be able to assess the Department of Social Security's considerations. It is important that they have the capacity to have someone act on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue is in relation to clause 11(7) where, as I said in my remarks earlier today, for the second time in legislation I have had to deal with&mdash;and I do not know about other times&mdash;we have a situation where the secretary to the department is able, in effect, to sit on a decision for more than 90 days and then, after sitting on the decision, the secretary's opinion holds. That seems to me to be completely contrary to any view of natural justice. That is why I recommend&mdash;and moved in my amendment to the second reading&mdash;that the presumption should favour the appellant, in fact the nursing home resident, where the decision on the appeal has not been made in time by the department.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We believe that this is a slightly different situation and subclause 11(7) provides that, where a person has requested reconsideration of their income determination and no decision is made within 90 days, then this is taken as confirmation of that determination. This is to the benefit of the person, as it means they can appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Most reconsiderations of income are made well within the 90 days. The suggested amendment is likely to mean that decisions in the person's favour will take longer if the 90&hyphen;day cut&hyphen;off is used to make a positive decision. The requirement to decide in the person's favour if a decision cannot be made within 90 days is also unrealistic, particularly in complex cases where further information needs to be obtained to adequately assess the person's income.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not seeking to have the time reduced, I am trying to get the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) to see that from the point of view of natural justice this clause favours the department doing nothing rather than favouring the needs of the nursing home resident. It seems that the minister is not prepared to take that natural justice consideration into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She mentioned that the person in the nursing home has the right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The third amendment that we sought to have moved is to allow nursing home residents to take their determinations through the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or the Veterans' Review Board because both these tribunals are much less legalistic than the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I would prefer that the secretary's opinion does not hold whether or not he or she makes a decision within the time. Given the minister is not going to agree to that, I would strongly urge her to consider allowing nursing home residents to take their appeals to these tribunals rather than immediately to the more legalistic Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The same situation applies for all other recipients of social security benefits.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to that, part 3 of the bill from clause 10 to 14 is about the review procedures, as is schedule 1. The key point is that if people make an appeal they will be treated exactly as they are treated now under the social security legislation or the veterans affairs legislation if they are a veteran. These were the arrangements under Labor when they were in government. Item 3 of schedule 1 enables people who have had their income determined by the Department of Social Security to appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Clause 14 allows veterans to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Item 4 of schedule 1 achieves this for Social Security clients. The Veterans' Review Board has no jurisdiction to review the assessment of income levels for any pension or benefit covering veterans. Its role is simply one of deciding entitlement to the pension itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People assessed for social security pension or benefit already enjoy one layer of review right compared to people covered by Veterans' Affairs. After they have used the internal review mechanisms they can still appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Veterans can only seek internal review of their assessment of income for pension purposes. They have no further appeal rights except to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and this is a right shared by people assessed by Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aged care legislation in effect is simply mirroring a difference which already exists between the Social Security and the Veterans' Affairs pension, which was the case when Labor was in government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the persuasive arguments of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), I do not think she has succeeded in convincing the opposition of the merit of her case on that point. I will move on to another point. The proposed system for exchanging information seems really complicated. The Department of Social Security or the Department of Veterans' Affairs accumulate all of the information on someone's income and assets. They pass that information on to the Department of Health and Family Services, which passes on some determination as to how much the nursing home day benefit is to be reduced to the nursing home. The nursing home, the third party in the chain, passes on to the fourth party in the chain&mdash;the resident&mdash;and lets them know how much their nursing home fees are going to be increased. Wouldn't it be more efficient to simply have the Department of Social Security make an adjustment to the person's pension and have it written on the correspondence to the pensioner that that deduction is being made as a result of this government's decision to impose this 25c in the dollar additional means test to cover the cost of the nursing home accommodation? Wouldn't that be simpler?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last point that I would like to raise with the minister concerns war widows. I am grateful for the fact that she has responded to a number of the points the opposition have been raising tonight. I think it certainly does help to make for a constructive debate in the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2961"> chamber. In your second reading speech, Minister, at the top of page 2, there was the following sentence:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special protections for war widows and widowers have been built into the bill so that they will not pay any more than other people with an equivalent income.  </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I was hoping the minister might clarify what that meant, because we know that there would be no way the government would be suggesting that in some way they would be put in a worse position than anyone else on an equivalent income. I am not quite sure what additional protection is given to war widows and widowers as a result of this clause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My second point is that in the past war widows over the age of 60&mdash;60 and a bit, these days&mdash;received a war widows pension plus an age pension. Sure, there is a means test on the age pension, but there is no means test on the war widows pension. That is my understanding. Let us assume that someone does have some interest income and their age pension as a result is reduced to zero but their war widows pension is still at the full rate, because there is no means test on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does the introduction of this 25c in the dollar means test mean that for the first time these people will have a means test applied to the war widows pension? If you would like to clarify that, I am happy to expand on the point. The point is that, I think, at the moment it is about $64 a week for war widows, and the result of this new introduction might mean that for the first time war widows will have a means test applied to that $64 a week war widows pension.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The provision in clause 8 is designed to make sure that, for residential aged care income testing, this special group of people are treated exactly the same as somebody who has an equivalent amount of money available to them each week. This is needed because where war widows or war widowers also receive a part age pension, various rules do apply which limit the amount of each type of pension and count income in special ways. The fact is that they will be tested in the same way that they
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are tested now. Without this provision, some people, though, could have their income assessed at a figure that is the same as someone who is not a war widow but, in fact, they could really have less money each week in their pocket.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have had a pretty constructive conversation here tonight, and we are at the last point, which is about war widows.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is no change in the war widows pension, can the minister assure me that there will be no reduction in the government's subsidy to the nursing home proprietor which, in effect, reduces the war widows pension because they are receiving that income from the Department of Veterans' Affairs? There is no point in saying, `You still get your money from the Department of Veterans' Affairs' if the government takes away 25c in the dollar of that money&mdash;or more&mdash;and recovers your war widows pension through an increase in the nursing home fee which is payable.

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Their purpose is to declare petroleum terminals on part IIIA downstream access for the Trade Practices Act. This is a very important reform, particularly in a week when the government is saying so much about small business, because, for all the talk and all the parliamentary answers and statements about small business, there was one sector that was totally forgotten&mdash;the small business service station sector in Australia. The government has declared its support for the closure of 3,000 out of the 9,000 service stations in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot believe that a government declares so much support for small business, yet does so little of substance to assist those 3,000 service station small businesses around the country, which are facing bankruptcy. I will just provide an instance of this government's neglect. I refer the House to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Liberal</EMPHASIS> newspaper from the town of Dubbo in central New South Wales. It started out a report on 14 March by saying: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Plunging petrol prices have Dubbo's fuel retailers at the brink of turmoil. One company is netting as little as $300 for a combined total of 140 hours per week, slightly more than $2 per hour.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So for all the words, for all the rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his cabinet colleagues about small business, this in fact is the reality in regional Australia of what is happening to small business under this government's negligent attitude to the petrol industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have existing service stations which are being squeezed out of business. A family
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> business in Dubbo working 140 hours per week with no greater income than $300, that is, $2 per hour&mdash;that is the reality of small business returns under this Howard government. And I cannot imagine anything more negligent, anything more abusive of the interests of small business than for a government to come out with a statement about the future of small business in Australia and to neglect the major industry, the major small business sector that is going to the wall, as a product of the government's inability to act with sensible reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those 3,000 service station small businesses around Australia that are going broke because of this government's negligence, the small business statement this week counts for nothing more than crocodile tears&mdash;nothing more than crocodile tears and empty platitudes about their particular circumstances. The truth is that the 9,000 service stations in Australia need a fair chance to compete. They ask for nothing more than a fair chance to compete against the likes of Woolworths, against the likes of the big petrol multinationals that have so much power and control in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These small family businesses ask for nothing more than a competitive wholesale market. All they are asking for is the same access to wholesale product that has now become the industry norm in electricity and gas. You do not need to own an electricity generator to be an electricity retailer on fair, competitive terms. Why then are these petrol service stations denied access to a competitively priced wholesale product? There is only one reason: the neglect of this government&mdash;the neglect of this government to do something constructive about the petrol industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a crisis in regional Australia when 3,000 small businesses are facing bankruptcy. There is a crisis that this government needs to face up to. Of course, the attitudes of this government are totally incorrect. I can refer the House to the views of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), who expressed his views in the Wagga <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Advertiser</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 7 March. He had this to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2964">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Retailers and franchisees blame the oil companies and the oil companies in turn blame the retailers and franchisees, but the truth is they equally share the blame. It may well be that the ACCC needs increased powers in order to be successful in legal action against those suspected of price fixing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">From its bottom ranks to its top ranks, this government is out of touch on basic petrol questions. Here is the Deputy Prime Minister saying that retailers are as much to blame for high prices as multinational petrol companies. That shows how out of touch the National Party is when it comes to these questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no need to blame the retailers in Australia. Their margins are so narrow that they are going broke&mdash;all for the sake of propping up multinational petrol companies. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party is out of touch. He should not be blaming the retailers and their skinny margins. With 3,000 of them likely to go broke because of this government's negligence, he should be blaming the multinational oil companies, because they have the control, the control from exploration stage to refinery, to production, to distribution, to retailing. They have integrated control throughout this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hilmer reforms 18 months ago sent a very clear message for public sector organisations that are vertically integrated with a homogenous product, that is, `Break up. Move towards vertical separation. If that is not possible in terms of ownership, access part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act for the downstream access regime.' It is a sensible reform for the public sector; why will this government not support it for the private sector?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government alibi of course is to say, `Oh, look, we are negotiating with these petrol companies.' You have Collins Street Costello wandering up and down Collins Street trying to negotiate with the big petrol companies on these matters, but all he is talking about is small `a' access. He is talking about access to petrol terminals on the terms and conditions set by the big companies, that is, no competitive price gain for retailers, no competitive price gain for the motorists around the country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that the only gains in this industry come from big `a' access, that is, legislated access, access under part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act. If the government talks the rhetoric of access, why is so scared of these amendments? Why will the government not support the amendments that write the access provisions into the law? Why will the National Party and its leader not do more than blame the retailers? Why will they not stand up to the big multinational companies and say that they are the same as public sector electricity or the same as public sector gas and that they need to be applied on the downstream access regime? These are sensible reforms. Nothing is more sensible. Nothing is more sensible than for this parliament to say, `If it is good enough for electricity and it is good enough for gas, it is good enough for the petrol industry.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a week in which the government has said that it is pro small business, it has no more outstanding reform on its agenda than to preserve the business interests of those 3,000 service station small businesses that they would otherwise send to the wall, with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs around regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that because of the franchised arrangements, the fixed onselling arrangements of the big companies, the existing service stations do not have a fair chance to compete against the likes of Woolworths. This government is turning country towns into `Planet Woolworths'. Woolworths will have all the groceries, the newsagency, the pharmacy and all the petrol retailing. And all the small businesses that the government talks about will be wiped out&mdash;wiped out because of the dominance of `Planet Woolworths' in country New South Wales and throughout the country. That is a terrible shame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why will the government not establish, by supporting these amendments, a competitive wholesale market? It is such a simple principle that existing service stations should have the same access to competitively priced wholesale petrol as the likes of Woolworths.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2965"> If they did that&mdash;if the government supported those measures and put them through the Senate&mdash;then, of course, petrol prices throughout Australia would drop by up to 6c a litre. That is not my figure; that is a figure from the MTAA, from the Service Station Association and from APADA, the distributors association. It is all right for some of the government figures to wobble their heads like dogs on the back of the car, but the truth is that if they talk the language of supporting small business they should be willing to accept the estimate by the small business sector about price gains of up to 6c a litre because of competitive wholesale prices and  an access regime. So these are commonsense reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business people in Australia should not be working 140 hours per week for $300 net gain&mdash;$2 per hour. That is the reality under the Howard government. We should not be facing around regional Australia the loss of 3,000 small business service stations and tens of thousands of jobs. There is one easy step for this government to take. Forget about all those reforms and handouts in the small business statement, change the law to declare petrol terminals and the downstream access regime and this government will do more for the small business sector in this country than it could ever imagine. Support the Labor reform and do the decent thing for small businesses, for jobs in regional Australia and for major pricing benefits for motorists across the nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech which we have just heard with regard to this proposed amendment by the opposition is quite amazing really. Here we have a person who was part of a government which instituted the Laidley agreement, under which you would not allow anybody except the TWU to go through the gates, and you come in here and you are talking about competition. What were they doing for 13 years? It is absolutely outrageous that the opposition spokesman for competition would come in here and talk about petrol stations and petrol on an issue that really relates to other sorts of infrastructure in this
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country, like electricity, or railway lines, or gas pipelines. He is trying to tag on here an issue that he wants to run that has already been defeated in the Senate and is going to be defeated here. It is really absolute grandstanding on the part of the opposition just to waste time with purely political point scoring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He knows it is a ludicrous suggestion because the essence of what he is saying, in regard to part IIIA, is that these people would have the right to have petrol they owned pumped, stored or refined, but they would not have the right to buy it. What a ludicrous suggestion. You have to own the petrol. Your suggestion is totally flawed. I am not sure where the opposition stands in regard to competition policy because you come in here running a line for competition, free trade and the rest of it, yet the rest of the opposition seems to have a line of going back to the 1960s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are opposed to this amendment because there is a range of reasons why this amendment would not work. We certainly do not believe it is sensible to be tacking this amendment, related to the petroleum industry, on to this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just go over a few points at this stage. The opposition's suggested application of this part IIIA access regime to petrol terminals is fundamentally misconceived. It is true that the petrol industry is vertically integrated, but petrol terminals are not natural monopolies. The opposition's amendment extends the scope of part IIIA far beyond its original intention as enacted by the present opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the opposition's amendment is technically flawed. Part IIIA provides access to infrastructure services, such as the service of moving electricity over a grid, not the supply of goods, as such goods are able to be linked to infrastructure services only if they are an integral subsidiary to the infrastructure service. The opposition amendment does not overcome this limitation, it just gives another example of infrastructure services, but this would still be subject to a limitation on goods. People who want access to terminals want petrol. That is the whole reason. It is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2966"> hardly integral but it is subsidiary to the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, a person who seeks access to terminal services under the opposition amendment would not have the right to buy petrol, only the right to have petrol they own stored, pumped or refined. So the amendment you are proposing is a ludicrous proposition. It just would not work. We, as a government, do support equally open access to petrol terminals and we are pursuing that and we will continue to, but this is not the place and not the legislation to be trying to tack it onto. Not only that, your proposal is unworkable.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the  Prime Minister (Mr Miles) has raised a few points that deserve a response. What he is doing when he criticises the opposition is also criticising the MTAA, the Service Station Association and APADA. He is criticising the aspirations and suggested reforms of close to 9,000 small businesses around Australia. Yet here was the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), just a few days ago, saying that this was a government that listens and acts on the advice of small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business in the service station sector and distributor sector of this industry supports the Labor Party reforms. As for his claim that part IIIA is only devised to deal with natural monopolies, he obviously has not read the ACCC material on this. The ACCC produced a discussion paper. If you read these things as thoroughly as I do, you will notice that there is a very significant note in that discussion paper which said that part III access can apply to natural monopolies but also to natural oligopolies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the petrol industry is&mdash;a natural oligopoly where obviously there is an economy of scale such that it is not economic for a vast number of participants to construct petrol terminals in every part of Australia. It has natural oligopoly features. The ACCC, in their published guidelines and in their evidence to a parliamentary committee chaired by the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), have said that it is totally proper to consider downstream access for natural oligopolies. So the parliamentary secretary and his advisers
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> need to catch up with the latest ACCC advice, as I have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the debate about whether it is a service or a good, it is up to the parliament. This is an amendment to a statute of the parliament, and the parliament can determine whether or not the semantic arguments about services and goods hold weight at law. What this parliament would be saying is: whether you declare petrol terminals and their products as services or goods, there will be downstream access to them. That is the right of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not here to have the country run by a dictionary. We are not here to have the country run by some bureaucrats looking up the finer points of the meaning of `service' and the meaning of `economic goods'. We are here to have it run by the parliament that wants to do good things in the public interest. The good thing in the public interest is to say that whether petrol terminals are a good or a service, they are essential facilities for downstream access purposes. That is what my amendments would achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the question about retailers not being able to access the wholesale petrol because they do not own it, what is the whole point of downstream access? Of course downstream accessors do not own the upstream wholesale product. They purchase the upstream wholesale product because there is excess capacity upstream. If there is a dispute about the pricing of the purchase, it goes on to the ACCC for arbitration. This is exactly the same principle that the parliament has legislated for electricity and gas, but somehow the government has a phobia about doing it for the private sector petrol industry. On each of these things the parliamentary secretary has been shot down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of what the Labor Party has been doing about it, goodness gracious me, who do you think carried the weight of the Hilmer reforms that got part IIIA written into the Trade Practices Act? It was the Australian Labor Party. So there we were getting the access regime into the act just 18 months ago and commissioning a report from the ACCC. If we had been in government we would have
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2967"> acted on the ACCC report by saying it was faulty, it missed the main game, it missed the boat when it came to sensible petrol reforms and the only thing to do is use the original act to put petrol on the downstream access regime. Again the parliamentary secretary is completely shot down in flames.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On each of the matters that he has raised before the parliament, he is clearly inadequate. He cannot explain why the government one day says that it listens to small business and the next day says, `We are going to ignore the interests of 3,000 service station small businesses which are likely to go broke.' While the parliamentary secretary sits on his hands and while the Prime Minister fiddles from Kirribilli House on Sydney  Harbour, these businesses go broke systematically. That will be marked down as the great black spot on the record of the Howard government. The irony of it is that the bowser boy Johnny Howard, who grew up in a small business service station family, sent them all broke.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This piece of legislation, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Male Total Average Weekly Earnings Benchmark) Bill 1997, originated as a result of debate in the Senate last year on the government's budget social security package in which the opposition moved an amendment to give legislative effect to the commitment to maintain pensions at or above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Faced with the possible prospect of it being agreed to, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) agreed to come back with a proposition of her own to give effect to the 25 per cent commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt the government would have people believe that this is a very generous measure on its part. It will be recalled that during the election campaign, after some degree of tardiness, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) agreed to adopt the 25 per cent benchmark, after having earlier said that he was only committed to maintaining the normal indexation arrangements for pensions. After being challenged about that, he gave this commitment and said, `Yes, we will maintain this 25 per cent benchmark,' the implication being that the benchmark would be maintained more or less in the form that it had operated under the Labor government where from April 1990 onwards, in fulfilment
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of our election commitment, we managed to consistently maintain the pension above 25 per cent average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem you have with this sort of commitment is that it is open to a number of different interpretations. What do you mean by maintaining the pension above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings? Does it mean, for example, maintaining it above 25 per cent over the entire course of a year, which is the way in which we interpreted it? Or does it mean maintaining the pension above 25 per cent of male average total weekly earnings on average over the course of a year, which is a somewhat weaker interpretation than the one that we adopted?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the two possible interpretations that were provided to the Minister for Social Security as part of the briefing to the incoming government. The two options in respect of this commitment were those two&mdash;that is, keep it above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings at all or keep it above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings on average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, this legislation goes for a significantly weaker commitment than that. It is a weaker commitment in a number of respects. For a start, and this is the most extraordinary facet of it, the legislation that the government has brought before the House today imposes a five&hyphen;year sunset provision on this commitment. In other words, the legislation ceases to operate after September 2002.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a truly remarkable way of approaching a commitment of this sort. If a commitment of this sort means anything at all, it should stand as a permanent arrangement. Of what use is it to a pensioner, or somebody expecting to go on the pension at some future time, to be granted a five&hyphen;year commitment to maintain that 25 per cent of average weekly earnings? Retirement incomes are quintessentially an area where you have to think long term. Any commitments you make, if they are to have any significance, have to be long&hyphen;term commitments. The notion that you would have a five&hyphen;year sunset provision on a proposition of this sort is just simply preposterous. It really shows quite clearly the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2969"> real significance of this government's commitment to pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the spread and growth of occupational superannuation in recent years, some fear has been expressed from within pensioner organisations that maybe the pension, as we know it, as a basic adequate safety net is an endangered entity. Suspicions have been expressed at various times that governments of whatever persuasion might, at some future time, intend to remove the pension in its present form as that basic income support safety net for people in retirement. A proposition like this, putting a five&hyphen;year sunset on a commitment to a basic adequacy benchmark, can only reinforce those sorts of concerns and reinforce them with a considerable degree of justification. Just what is this government's long-term perspective about pensions and retirement incomes generally?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that dealing with the long&hyphen;term fiscal implications of an ageing population is one of the central challenges which will face any future government of this country. You need to put in place a framework of policy that is capable of dealing with the sorts of circumstances with which we are going to be faced, with a steadily increasing proportion of the population of pensionable age. By the time you get a few decades into the next century, that is going to be a very significant fiscal contribution, not only because of its impact on social security outlays but because of its impact on a variety of other outlays, particularly health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is saying, `We have made this commitment for five years and we will keep it for five years, but we are a bit worried about where it might lead us from a fiscal point of view in the long term and we do not want to be locked in.' I do not think this provides any grounds for confidence on the part of pensioners about what this government is likely to do about this or what its long&hyphen;term intentions are in the retirement income area. There is no doubt that the ageing of the population is something for which substantial preparations are going to have to be made, and they are going to have to be made now.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government, we took a number of steps to try to make sure that we were in a situation where we could deal with an ageing population. The decision to raise the pensionable age of women to equate it with that of men over a 20&hyphen;year period&mdash;a measure that was introduced during my period as Minister for Social Security&mdash;is one example. The whole thrust of policy under us&mdash;to achieve the most efficient possible targeting in our social security safety net&mdash;was also part of that. As anybody who lived through the political battles over the introduction of the assets test in the mid&hyphen;1980s will recall, particularly in the early years of the government, decisions that brought no small amount of political pain to the government at the time had to be taken to ensure that we had a properly targeted system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some hard decisions that had to be made, and we showed ourselves prepared to make them. However, the reason those sorts of decisions ultimately proved to be politically sustainable was that people were able to have reasonable confidence that we had a robust commitment to the basic pension and to maintaining its adequacy&mdash;not just indexing it so that it kept track of inflation, but linking it to a benchmark that related to community standards and expectations in terms of living standards. Hence, we saw the links to average weekly earnings as being absolutely fundamental.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To recapitulate, what we did in government was develop a social security safety net&mdash;including that relating to aged pensions&mdash;that was efficiently targeted but where we went to a great deal of effort to ensure that the adequacy of the basic payment structure was sustained and that, in the case of pensions and a number of other payments, there was a clear linkage between the level of those payments and some sort of community standard. That commitment on our part was beyond doubt. Given the overall policy framework that we created and were putting in place, which included taking a long&hyphen;term view of things&mdash;the move to substantially raise the extent and level of superannuation coverage obviously has implications in the long&hyphen;term for the level
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2970"> of social security outlays&mdash;and given, as I said, the efficient targeting we sought to build into the structure, we believe that it was possible to have a sustainable adequate basic pension in the long&hyphen;term. That was what we were on about providing and not just a short&hyphen;term five&hyphen;year commitment to something so inherently long&hyphen;term in nature as retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of modelling exercises were undertaken. I recall that there was quite a bit of attention given to getting a better handle on just what was likely to develop in this area in terms of long&hyphen;term fiscal implications. The so&hyphen;called retirement income modelling task force which was made up of officials from the Department of Social Security, the Department of Finance and Treasury, did a lot of work to analyse and evaluate what the long&hyphen;term implications of our policy framework would be. That is a necessarily uncertain process, although when you are talking about  demographic factors it is possible to talk about things with some degree of confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basic structure was a very sound one. In 1995, the World Bank released a report on how different countries were coping with the problem of an ageing population. That report explicitly endorsed the broad approach we had adopted towards ensuring an adequate retirement income system which had sufficient flexibility to enable us to cope with the fiscal consequences of an ageing population. A three&hyphen;legged structure has been developed in this country, where the foundation is an efficiently targeted but adequate pension system increasingly supplemented by contributory superannuation and the third leg is private savings&mdash;which in this country, historically, has taken the form of people acquiring their own homes. About 70 per cent of our pensioner population own their own home outright, which is a very high rate of home ownership by world standards. Given those three legs of retirement income policy, I believe we created a sustainable system in which pensioners could have confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the first point I would make about the way in which this government is stepping away from the fundamental commitment to an
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adequate basic pension linked to average earnings. It is clearly farcical to interpret that, with its five year time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I have made is that there are different ways you can interpret the 25 per</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2971">
<PARA STYLE="Para">cent commitment. Does it mean, as I said, keeping the pension above 25 per cent of average male total weekly earnings at all points throughout the year? Does it mean, alternatively, keeping it above 25 per cent of average earnings over the course of the year on average&mdash;in other words, being prepared to accept that there might be points where it dips below?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the two interpretations that were traditionally argued about and we interpreted the commitment as being to keep it above AWE at all points. There are problems with that. If average earnings move quickly, you could find a situation where momentarily the level of pension could dip below that benchmark. But the point is that our commitment was to that interpretation of the benchmark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So they are the two possibilities that, I suppose, have been talked about as the main options in this area. I have a copy of the briefing that was provided to the incoming government after the election of March last year. The section which talks about this point actually deals with those two options which I have just described and provides detailed costings of those two options. I seek leave to have a table incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> which sets out the costings to the department of the two options that I have discussed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you look at the figures in those tables on both the interpretations I talked about, and if you look at a comparable year, which is 1998&hyphen;99, the sums involved exceed by very large magnitude the estimated fiscal impact of this bill. Obviously, those figures are not directly comparable because there are all sorts of parameter changes that have taken effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot directly and precisely compare figures in this legislation with the numbers that appear in those estimates that were prepared for the incoming government. I acknowledge that, but the differences are not marginal differences. You are talking about a very large order of magnitude by which estimates of the fiscal impact in a comparable year, an estimate for the incoming government, exceed the estimated fiscal impact of the government's legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That makes it very clear that this represents a substantial weakening of the commitment to the 25 per cent benchmark, as we interpreted it. The pensioners of Australia need to understand that very clearly. This is a government that wants to put a short time frame on legislation with a five&hyphen;year sunset provision combined with a substantial weakening of the interpretation of the benchmark as it is to apply over that period of time. That is the second point.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point, as I said, is the sunset provision. The second point is the way in which the 25 per cent commitment is being interpreted. The third point is the lack of provision for the flow-ons, which we regarded as fundamental, from the pension benchmark to certain other social security payments. Some of those flow&hyphen;ons will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, in this legislation, has explicitly incorporated the married rate of pension as well as the single rate of pension. Half the married rate is currently 83 per cent of the single rate of pension, and that ratio will be maintained. So the government is, in fact, honouring the weakened short&hyphen;term form of the commitment in regard to married pensioners. It is also going to be an automatic consequence that the benchmark will flow through to family payments. The family payments are currently legislatively linked to the married rate of pension, and that legislation stands so those two flow&hyphen;ons will operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are a number of others that are not legislatively provided for, and I am talking about the rate of payment to married allowees, to certain single allowees, particularly those with dependent children, and to those over the age of 60 who have been on income support for six months or more. We maintained that link. This government appar
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2973"> ently does not intend to do so. There are significant budgetary savings there, but we would argue that it is unacceptable for people in that circumstance&mdash;that is, people on very low incomes with dependent children. We would maintain that their incomes also ought to be linked to some sort of community standard as well as the CPI. The government apparently does not share that point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those three reasons, we think this legislation and the approach this government is taking represent a major weakening of that core fundamental commitment to an adequate pension. This is one of the strengths of the system we have in this country. It is interesting to note that, in the debates that have gone on in the UK about retirement incomes, even within the Labour Party over there, it has been considered a bit too hot to have this explicit link between average earnings and the rate of pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is a very strong feature of the system we have developed in this country, and it is highly unfortunate that this government has seen fit to so substantially weaken the commitment. As I said, the government was forced, in effect, by action in the Senate to bring forward some sort of piece of legislation on this. In a sense, I think it has been quite useful because it has made transparent just exactly how this government views things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It likes to talk about its commitment to older Australians, and the reality is that the coalition did receive substantial support from older Australians in the last election. There are no two ways about that but, once older Australians start to gain a more accurate perception of just what this government is on about, that position is likely to start to change. This legislation is one facet of this government's approach to older Australians and pensioners in particular. There is a range of other acts that the government has undertaken, particularly in the last budget, that adversely affect older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition said before it came into office that it would not do anything to reduce the basic rate of pension. Technically, it might not have done that&mdash;although, as I said, it has brought in this much weaker commitment to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the 25 per cent of the AWE&mdash;but it did do a number of other things in the last budget that have a significant impact on the living standards of pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the government abolished the earnings credit, which was a significant savings measure, and decided to deem on small bank deposits. More significant were the changes in nursing homes, which for some older people are going to have a very major impact. They also made changes in the concessional pharmaceutical arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these things are effective reductions in the living standards of pensioners. They vary obviously according to the individual circumstance, but there is no question that there are some pretty ugly things being done to older Australians. The nursing home matter is the most egregious, but there are a range of others: for example, looking beyond the pensioners, for the older people of work force age, the decision to have deeming provisions on superannuation assets for people over the age of 55 is another example of an action by this government that is deleterious for older Australians&mdash;the people who will later be in the pension system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum up, the government clearly intends that this legislation be viewed as a highly benign measure. The fact is, though, that the government was compelled to do this as a result of action by the Senate. It is not a benign measure. It does represent a substantial weakening. The good thing about it is that it actually makes far more transparent just what this government is on about in the retirement incomes area. In due course, the reality of that is going to start to come through to older Australians. At this stage, I would like to formally move the second reading amendment which has been circulated. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Male Total Average Weekly Earnings Benchmark) Bill gives legislative effect to the government's commitment to maintain the single adult rate of pension at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings as well as continuing the existing relativity between the single and married rate of pension, the latter being 83 per cent of the single rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All social security pensioners, service pensioners and income support supplement recipients will benefit from this measure. Additionally, because of the existing legislative link between the partnered rate of pension and the maximum rate of family payment, MTAWE increases will flow through to the family payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation takes effect, as we have just heard, from 20 September 1997 and it will have a five&hyphen;year sunset clause ending on 21 September 2002. The sunset clause, with a measure like this, is of course eminently reasonable. In fact, it is quite responsible of any government, whoever that may be at the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time, to review the nature of the outlays, how well this has worked for pensioners in particular and whether it needs to be reviewed either up or indeed down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost is locked into the forward estimates at a little over $2 billion for the four years of the estimates. As noble as its intent may be, it is not appropriate to extend these amendments to allowances because pensioners, by definition, usually are required to live indefinitely on the basic pension, and allowees will in any case continue to have their benefits indexed to allow for increases in the consumer price index.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many of us could live on a pension? How many of us in fact know what the level of the current pension is? The single pension is currently $347.80 a fortnight. That is $173 a week or $24.50 a day. The pensioner couple need to survive on $290.10 each per fortnight. The maximum payment diminishes once you start earning $98 a fortnight. Sixteen per cent of those on a full pension rely on nothing other than that pension&mdash;that is, $24 a day, and that is up from 15 per cent last year. One million aged pensioners receive the full pension. As such, they do not benefit from policies that are delivered through the taxation system to retired and working people who of course are paying taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation has supported and commended the government's initiative to put a legislative floor under pensions by making them equal to at least 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. That adds certainty and stability to the system. Again, I come back to the sunset clause. This is plain commonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked the statistics group in the Parliamentary Library to provide me with some figures as to how movements in pensions would have fared had they been set at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings over the preceding five years. Had they been at that level, the pension in March this year would have been $5.60 less than the $173 that it currently is. In other words, this is an absolute minimum but at least it provides some degree of certainty. I think it makes
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2975"> quite a bit of sense to review it at the end of a five-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pension is $24 a day, yet examples of the typical prices for essential groceries are as follows: a litre of milk is $1.15; bread is $1.68 a loaf; a packet of tea bags is $3.24; butter is $1.70; eggs are $1.80 for a dozen; toilet paper is $1.38 for four rolls; four lamb chops are $4.20; a kilogram of potatoes is $1.68; and one kilogram of carrots is $1.60. If you think about having $24 a day on which to live, pensioners have every reason to be cynical about pension movements being linked simply to the consumer price index. The latest figures indicate that in the six months to December 1996, prices rose by only 0.2 per cent. In fact, as most of us are aware, we have the lowest inflation rate in years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The annualised price increases last year were 1.5 per cent but petrol increased by 3.1 per cent, hospital and medical charges increased by five per cent&mdash;keep in mind we have 850,000 people over the age of 65 still with private health insurance&mdash;cigarettes were up 4.4 per cent, and of course I would advise pensioners to give that away; and food increases averaged 3.2 per cent for the year, which was more than double the official consumer price index.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What pensioners know much more than any of us, or our partners who may do the shopping, is that whilst we may say that the consumer price index has been 1.5 per cent underlying or there is a headline inflation rate of 2.1 per cent, most people know when they are shopping that the prices of the things they are buying to survive on are rising at a rate far in excess of that. In fact, fresh fruit and vegetables were up 16.8 per cent last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons the CPI is as it is is home mortgage rates, which fell last year 7.8 per cent. But there are only 11.5 per cent of people between the ages of 55 and 64 who are paying off a mortgage and for those above 75 years the rate is 3.2 per cent. I think the Pensioners and Superannuants Federation make a very legitimate point when they say that perhaps bank fees should be included in CPI calculations. Certainly, pensioners think so for very understandable reasons.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another critical area for pensioners is that of concessions. The 1993 liberalisation of the means test for pensioner concession cards has resulted in many concessions offered to pensioners being reduced in value over the ensuing four years. There is also a disturbingly ad hoc approach to concessions that lacks national uniformity. Even more importantly, concessions or rebates are not indexed for increases in the cost of living. I think state and local governments should mirror the Commonwealth's actions in this bill by indexing concessions which are so essential to the financial survival of pensioners. Our government, in particular, in reviewing national competition policy needs to take into account the community service obligations of organisations that become the subject of privatisation, so that the importance of a concession to a pensioner trying to survive in this modern world is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend to honourable members the results of a study that was conducted and released last year by the Older Women's Network. It was entitled `Difficult decisions; older women talk about money, life and retirement'. There were 245 respondents to the survey and there are some results in particular that I draw the House's attention to. Some 80 per cent of women surveyed were worried about finding money to replace household equipment which had worn out, rates, house repairs and premiums. The research demonstrated the ways in which older women have contributed to their family's needs, often at great expense to their own long&hyphen;term economic security. I think many of us here have mothers or grandmothers who have done just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 17 per cent of women living alone relied solely on the pension and 63 per cent of women pensioners received a full pension; 84 per cent of respondents who relied only on the pension were battling to make ends meet and 72 per cent were dissatisfied with their quality of life. Many expressed little faith in the responsiveness of the public hospital system and 45 per cent of those respondents, despite all that, still maintained private health insurance for which, if they are married, they will receive $250 in a rebate come 1 July.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2976">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the comments made sincerely by the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin). I think we will need to be vigilant to see that pensioners do not go backwards. The 25 per cent male total average weekly earnings figure, if applied over the past five years, would have meant the pension would currently be about $168.30 rather than $173. The legislation sets a floor, irrespective of what happens in the rest of the economy, but a floor above which I believe the government will need to keep.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any consideration of pensions must necessarily occur in the context of the income side of government. As late as only a few days before last year's federal election, we were told that the budget was doing all right and that we did not have a deficit when we did have one of $10.3 billion. Pensions and social security are one of the three big ticket items of government. Expenditure is very much a function of the general state of the economy. In the 1995&hyphen;96 years, for example, we spent $71.3 billion on health, education and welfare, which is more than all of the money that was raised by taxes on PAYE income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I will not be here tomorrow to conclude my address, the one point I would like to make is that as the population ages; as the Internet becomes increasingly used; as we see growing income disparity in Australia; as we move into an environment of international competitiveness; as a lessening proportion of income earners in Australia, compared with those relying on social security benefits, develops; as the economy globalises; as we realise that public sector deficits are no longer sustainable; and we become increasingly aware of the vertical, fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states, it seems quite obvious to me that until we simplify Australia's taxation system it is going to be increasingly difficult for people to create more wealth in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, until we broaden the tax base, whenever that may be, the government of the day will have no option but to continue to review necessary government spending programs. We cannot forever continue to tax productivity, employment and savings. I think the people who are suffering most from the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> narrow nature of the taxation base are those who most benefit from government spending.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you today as a very upset and concerned member of the community. I received from the Department of Social Security a letter to inform me that I would lose $30 from my `rent assistance', starting from 1st July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I am unemployed and cannot afford to lose any money from my benefit I called my local member to express my concerns over this and also put my concerns in writing. I then proceeded to call Mr Tierney's Newcastle office to ask why this was happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I called and was asked for my name and phone number and was told that somebody would call me back. When the person did call me back, the first thing I was asked was `who did you vote for?' I then stated `Labor'. I then was given a complete run down of what Labor had done wrong before the Liberal Party took over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again I asked `Why am I losing $30 from my benefit?' I then got the reply `So?' So much for Liberal concerns about we unemployed. I am unemployed by no fault of my own. I would like nothing more than a real job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am trying very hard to get a job and I must believe that I will hopefully get a job soon. It is very hard to try and live from fortnight to fortnight. When I get my fortnightly payment I have to pay my rent, buy my food and clothing, pay my power and water bill as well as live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">So can you now tell me how the hell I am supposed to live $30 short each fortnight, when I am now struggling from fortnight to fortnight to survive? It may not seem much to you, but then again I am not getting paid what you get paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very angry at the way in which I was treated by Senator Tierney's office today and would

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems that being unemployed means that I am not a part of the community and that I am in some way to blame for being unemployed. It would seem that we are not of any importance to the Government and we should be overlooked.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your time and I hope that you will have the matter of this new policy reviewed. I would see this as a sign that the Liberals are not all together only for the rich and the strong.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week in Newcastle we found Social Security offices short of staff because the staff were off on stress leave. The difficulty they are having in implementing these changes is causing enormous problems. The government members all know that. I have heard it around the corridors; I hear and see the differences going on. But what are you doing about it? Are you doing the same as Senator Tierney? Are you only responding to Liberal voters? Are you asking who they vote for first? Is that the new method of governing the country: by the Liberals for the Liberals only?

Indeed, Australian universities, ranked amongst the best in the world, have often been champions of new ideas in Australian society, challenging individuals to apply themselves to move beyond the threshold of change. However, while the importance of universities as institutions of academic excellence is rarely understated, often overlooked are the ways in which universities can empower regional economies like South Australia, generating many jobs and opportunities for a community that has been hit hard by the economic mismanagement of years of state and federal Labor governments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2978"> mately 45,000 students are enrolled in South Australian universities, a significant number of whom are overseas students. It will come as little surprise, then, that a report conducted by the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies in 1996 into the contribution universities make to the state economy recognised higher education as South Australia's fastest growing export industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">University expenditure in South Australia is $600 million each year, equivalent to 1.7 per cent of gross state product. Universities draw roughly $400 million worth of Commonwealth expenditure into the state, as well as over $200 million from non-Commonwealth sources. A conservative estimate of the flow-on impact of this expenditure suggests that as much as $1,050 million is added to the state economy every year, generating 19,000 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to these direct benefits to the South Australian economy, many indirect benefits also exist. All three universities are engaged in collaborative research with local public and private sector enterprises, fuelling economic growth by providing links between research and commercialisation. South Australian universities have played a critical role in attracting high technology growth industry to the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each year, approximately 10,000 students complete university courses taught in the state. While many seek entry to higher degrees, 80 per cent of those entering the work force find employment in South Australia. The universities, then, are the major suppliers of professional staff to South Australian industry and government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another indirect benefit to the state economy is provided by the many annual conferences organised and hosted by South Australia's tertiary institutions. Last year, one conference alone attracted more than 500 delegates from around the world and generated expenditure of approximately $1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, conferences and university organised events make more than a financial contribution to the state economy. They also establish South Australia as a prestigious site of intellectual achievement&mdash;a reputation forged both nationally and internationally. This
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reputation has been reinforced further by the relations established by university staff with institutions of excellence throughout the world, increasing the potential for positive spin&hyphen;offs for regional economic development, including the attraction of new industries. For these reasons, universities provide many long-term benefits and are vitally important to the economic wellbeing of the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As economic activity becomes less resource intensive and more knowledge intensive, industry will increasingly demand a skilled and well&hyphen;educated work force. This will place greater emphasis on university research, teaching and training to ensure that the contribution that South Australian universities make in empowering the state's economy will continue to grow. I imagine that the members who represent the Hunter Valley region&mdash;one of whom is here&mdash;and the members representing Newcastle would envy the role that the three universities in South Australia I have mentioned play in the South Australian economy.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2978"><TITLE>Small Business

The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in particular, has had a fair bit to say about small business ever since then. He has described the small business sector as the engine room of the economy. He says that the government package would give small business every encouragement to hire new staff. We will wait and see, because certainly they are shedding jobs in the universities&mdash;in particular, in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Tonight, I too want to talk about small business. In particular, I want to talk about 900 small businesses around this nation. I want to talk about the 900 independent chicken growers around this nation. I also want to speak about the chicken processing industry. Those two industries between them, directly and indirectly, employee around 17,000 Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has Mr Howard said to this sector? He has said, `Look, up until now you have
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2979"> enjoyed protection from imports.' That protection, I recognise, has been underpinned by quarantine concerns. I am delighted the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) has joined us because he, too, has recognised what a sham this whole process has been and what a threat the importation of chicken meat is to the local industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard says to the industry, `But under the new world order, this protection must go. We must allow the giants in the USA, the EU and Thailand to export their chicken into this country.' In other words, he is saying that he will slash the tariff rate from 100 per cent to zero per cent overnight and he says, `But you must simply adjust.' The Howard government wants to be seen internationally as the perfect free trader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chicken industry is not an industry that is hidden behind tariff walls. It has grown steadily in terms of production, jobs and investment. It has enjoyed annual growth of up to 20 per cent over the past decade. It has improved its competitiveness both domestically and internationally and, of course, it is value adding. Raw poultry now represents about 50 per cent of production.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just welcome the interjections from the member for Paterson, because this is an industry his government is selling out and he is not prepared to stand up to it. You should come over to this side and have your say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Raw value added product accounts for about 30 per cent of the market now and is growing at a rate of between eight per cent and 10 per cent. The cooked product now represents 20 per cent of the market and is growing at between 15 per cent and 20 per cent. Total investment in the industry is now around $2 billion. This is a very significant domestic market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Adding value means adding jobs. This industry is adding jobs where we need them most&mdash;in rural and regional Australia. You would think the member for Paterson would be on his feet defending this industry. As I said earlier, directly and indirectly this indus
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> try creates 17,000 jobs in Australia. And they want to talk about cutting a little red tape. They would do much better to simply stand up for this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The USA, the European Union and Thailand are the world's major poultry producing nations. But post the Uruguay Round, these countries still operate on a playing field you could hardly describe as level. In fact, some countries&mdash;for example, Singapore&mdash;use the Uruguay Round to actually increase their tariffs. While the USA is not a heavy subsidiser of its poultry industry, it uses its export subsidies to expand its agricultural markets at Australia's expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The export enhancement program for the period July 1996 to June 1997 provided bonuses for the export of 33,000 tonnes of frozen chicken meat to 27 countries. Thailand and other Asian nations use strong fiscal incentives, such as tax breaks and subsidies, to assist their local industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought, as I have said, that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), who has made a complete botch of this whole issue, would stand up for the industry, and I would have thought that the member for Paterson would also be standing up. I would have thought that they would be adopting the unanimous recommendations of the all&hyphen;party Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee to ensure that jobs in rural and regional Australia are maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no good coming in here and talking about cutting red tape and those peripheral issues if they are not prepared to simply stand up and defend a very strong and very significant local industry. Don't worry about anything else&mdash;just defend the jobs we already have.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2979"><TITLE>Sheffield Shield</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At 5.12 p.m. Canberra time a historic event was taking place in Western Australia, the likes of which has only ever occurred on one previous occasion. Most Queenslanders will know what I am referring to and a great many Western Australians will wish they did not. I am
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2980"> speaking about the quest for the Holy Grail of cricket&mdash;yes, the Sheffield Shield.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today Queensland won the shield for only the second time in the history of the competition, and they did it with style. With the odds stacked against them, the young Queenslanders dominated the final from day one. The side had been labelled as the rank outsiders to win the shield for a number of reasons. Firstly, we had just managed to scrape into the final after a tense last round in which we had to win outright and hope New South Wales could beat Tasmania. This was one of the very few occasions on which you could catch a Queenslander openly barracking for a cockroach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once into the final, history was well and truly against the young lads from the Sunshine State. Since the finals concept was introduced 15 years ago, only one side has won away from home. Further stacked against our intrepid Bulls was that statistic. In 47 visits to the WACA, Queensland had won just seven matches. The Sandgropers had dominated the regular season and only needed to salvage a draw to win the shield.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make matters worse, on match eve, confidential documents walked from the Queensland dressing room and ended up in enemy hands. These papers listed the strengths and weaknesses of all the Queensland playing staff. The papers also suggested points of attack against the West Australians. Fortunately, it would seem that either the West Australians decided in the interests of sportsmanship that they would not use the information or, alternatively, they simply could not understand it. How else could you explain their performance in the final? Despite these setbacks, and the fact that Hayden, Healy and Bickel are all in South Africa, our Queensland boys achieved the ultimate: their second shield win in three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a match of personal milestones and courageous if not heroic performances. The bowling of Adam Dale and Michael Kasprowicz has been inspirational, as has the leadership of Stuart Law. Law has proven himself to be an innovative and adventurous leader. His move to give spinner Paul Jackson a ball just 10 overs old was both brave and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inspirational, and it paid off with an immediate wicket. His team&hyphen;mates have not let him down. They have pulled together against all odds to win in sensational style.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as with any champion team, there is always one stand&hyphen;out player&mdash;one who performs above and beyond the call of duty. In this match that player was&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SMITH" NAMEID="SK6">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Trevor Barsby.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XK6">Mrs WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Trevor `Tank' Barsby. In his last year of shield cricket, Tank could not have wished for a better send-off. He has been the stand&hyphen;out player of the final. His century in the second innings was an amazing knock. Battling a severe bout of flu, Tank carried on well past the comfort zone. If not for the encouragement of skipper Law, Trevor said he would have thrown his wicket away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, wait, there is more. His contribution did not end there. Upon taking the field in the second innings, Tank pulled off what Stuart Law described as the greatest catch he has ever seen. This phrase gets bandied about, particularly by a certain television commentator, but on this occasion Law was not far off the mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Barsby's herculean efforts in this final have been matched possibly by just one other, West Australian skipper Tom Moody. Moody's second innings dig was inspirational and possibly the only thing that saved the West Australians from total humiliation. Unfortunately, he was largely left alone in his defiance. His team's last ditch effort to save the match was commendable but way too late as the horse had, as they say, bolted. The Queenslanders had a throttle hold on the match from day two and were not about to let it go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After being the butt of many jokes for far too many years, the Queensland Bulls have come of age. They have proven that their victory in 1995 was not a fluke. With the team brimming with young talent, I predict that this is the start of a glorious decade for the Queensland Bulls.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in the grievance debate I outlined some of the stories of the motor vessel <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter</EMPHASIS> , a Greek owned Panamanian registered ship of shame. One shipowner company, the Associated Euro&hyphen;Atlantic Co., is out of London. After the ship's arrival off Port Newcastle on 12 January 1997, the crew of the vessel complained to the International Transport Federation about mistreatment and non-payment of wages. Polembros Maritime Co. Ltd of Piraeus, the managers of the ship, conjoined the Port Waratah Coal Services, the International Transport Federation, the Maritime Union of Australia and the Newcastle Port Corporation in legal action for damages under section 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The union had sought permission to board the vessel at anchor. This permission was denied by the Captain, Georgios Kourtessis. Honduran and Romanian crew members wanted to get off the ship to escape threats from the Greek officers, particularly from Chief Officer Nikolaos Georgiadis, and to collect unpaid wages. I happened to speak to that chief officer just before the ship sailed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the ship is managed by the Polembros Maritime Co. Ltd of Piraeus. The company has an established record around the world of denying its crew wages, medical care and even reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by crew members in respect of work related illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ships in the fleet include the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">African Addax</EMPHASIS> in which 12 seafarers were replaced before coming to Australia in December 1996 to avoid action in Australia for unpaid wages. They have had trouble with other ships in relation to their crew entitlements on the vessels the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Leon</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Leonidas</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Theocennitor</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brazil Vitoria</EMPHASIS>. The company has a reputation of using multiracial crews. In the case of the ship in Newcastle, the crew was made up of a mixture of Honduran, Filipino, Greek and Romanian sailors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strategy behind the use of multiracial crews like that sometimes is to keep the crew in small groups, because a crew all of the one
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tongue makes it easier for the crew to organise in respect of their mistreatment and when they have not been paid their proper entitlements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Divide and rule. That is exactly what it is about. The ship management company, Polembros Maritime, was due in court again today in pursuit of its actions under sections 45D and 45E against the parties that I mentioned earlier. I do not know what has happened there. But again we see a foreign corporation using Australia's domestic law to seek to evade its international obligations in respect of sea safety, ship safety and crew treatment&mdash;obligations to which Australia strongly subscribes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This company is making a laughing stock of Australia in the shipping world. Polembros's action against the MUA and the ITF is aimed at preventing these unions from assisting foreign crews to collect their rightful wages&mdash;not something they are not entitled to, just the wages that they have signed up for and the ordinary treatment that we would take for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is abhorrent to me that Australian lawyers would be party to activities aimed at exploiting and abusing Third World seafarers. And the seagulls tell me&mdash;we all know about the seagulls&mdash;that the firm of Norton Smith and Co. out of Sydney, maritime lawyers, are on a retainer to watch any action by the Maritime Union of Australia and the ITF to grab them under 45D and 45E and make an example of them. They thought they had them with the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter</EMPHASIS>, except that there was not any industrial action and the case is still before the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Polembros is a rogue shipping company that manages a fleet of 25 ships, almost all of them, 23, are 19 years of age or older. It has an established history of mistreatment and  underpayment of Third World crews. The flag state at fault, the Panamanian government, has to accept some responsibility, but the Greek government must accept responsibility for infamous behaviour by Greek corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greek government claims that ships wearing its flag are not ships of shame&mdash;well,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2982"> that is contestable&mdash;yet it turns a blind eye to the substandard practices followed by Greek shipowners and Greek ship management companies. The ruthless and exploitative practices of some of these owners and managers damage Greece's reputation across the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want this government to give a commitment not to allow Australian law to be used by foreign shipping corporations to evade their international maritime obligations for safety at sea and treatment of crew. I call upon the government to raise in the strongest terms with the Panamanian government the failure of ships registered in Panama to comply with international maritime regulations and Panama's failure to carry out flag state obligations, with special reference to the murder of Budi Santosi on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Glory Cape</EMPHASIS> just off Port Hedland on 31 October 1995&mdash;which remains to this day uninvestigated, and the crew carries on and ship carries on&mdash;and also in respect of the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2982"><TITLE>Small Business</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak about the plight of small business, a particular small business operator in my electorate. This is a story of a typical small business operator who has worked on the premise that if you work hard and do the right thing you will get ahead and be able to enjoy your life to its fullest. I would also like to take the opportunity to compliment the government on the small business package which was released this week, particularly the changes to capital gains tax, FBT, unfair dismissal and streamlining red tape&mdash;an excellent package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I would like to highlight a brief history of a businessman in my electorate who has been having a number of problems. His named is Mr Bill McColloch. His father, Bill senior, purchased a muffler and exhaust business in 1985 with the opportunity to become self&hyphen;employed and to successfully operate a business. The purchase of this business included a distribution agreement with Berklee Distributors of Queensland. Although this agreement did not include royalties, it did give the McCollochs sole selling rights for Berklee products in the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> region stretching from Murwillumbah to Currumbin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September 1988 Berklee Retail was forced to oversee the Berklee exhaust franchise nationwide. It approached independent Berklee distributors all over Australia in an attempt to sign them up to Berklee franchise. Mr McColloch was approached and offered the Berklee franchise but declined. At the time, he was told that the agreement he had with Berklee Distributors in Queensland would still be honoured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Berklee Retail decided to keep pursuing Mr McColloch to try to convert him to the new agreement, but the offer was again declined on the grounds that their business continued to trade successfully under the old arrangement and that the new arrangement with Berklee Retail sounded totally restrictive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr McColloch was then contacted by the Managing Director of Berklee Retail, Mr John Rippon, who offered yet another financial package to bring the McCollochs into the Berklee Retail franchise. Again, the offer was declined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr McColloch said that at this stage Mr Rippon lost his patience and threatened the McCollochs that if they did not accept the Berklee Retail deal Berklee would open a store just around the corner in direct competition with him. Bill McColloch and his father were faced with an ominous choice&mdash;ignore the offer and watch as they were forced out of business by Berklee Retail or join Berklee Retail and try to continue making a profit under their restrictive franchise agreement. The McCollochs were forced to sign, with no mediation or compromise offered by Berklee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be pointed out that Mr McColloch was told that the franchise agreement would include a package whereby 50 per cent of royalties would be spent on local advertising, promotion and marketing within his demographic area. These claims are all repeated in a booklet and video produced by Berklee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr McColloch has told me that from January 1989 when they signed with Berklee until 1991 they strictly adhered to the franchise arrangements. Unfortunately, Berklee
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2983"> did not do the same. Berklee's local advertising and support package failed to materialise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the agreement also included the requirement that Berklee would supply its franchisees only with Berklee products and that Berklee franchisees would sell only Berklee products. Again, Berklee did not hold up their end of the bargain. Instead, they produced cheaper and unbranded products which were sold to non-Berklee outlets in direct competition to Bill McColloch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point I want to highlight to the House that Mr McColloch is not the only hard-working small business person that has been deceived by Berklee retail. My National Party colleague the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) spoke in this place in December last year highlighting that exactly the same problems were being experienced with a constituent in his electorate. I congratulate the member for his work in highlighting this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My neighbouring MP, the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), and the member for Makin (Ms Draper) in Adelaide have also received complaints from other franchisees in relation to this issue. Both the member for Capricornia and I have written to the Chairman of the ACCC, Allan Fels, asking that he investigate what seem to be serious breaches of the Trade Practices Act. I encourage other members in this House,  regardless of their politics, who have been contacted by discontented franchisees with Berklee, to add their weight to this debate. I would also urge that the ACCC leave no stone unturned to ensure the allegations raised by these franchisees are fully investigated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Berklee is found to have acted in any way unconscionably or to have breached any section of the Trade Practices Act, I would implore the ACCC to throw the book at them and apply to the Federal Court for compensation. As I mentioned before, this is a group of hardworking, honest small business people who have done the right thing but have been deceived and driven to the point of bankruptcy by the actions of a large company. I bring this to the attention of the House.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="11 p.m." PAGE="2983"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">House adjourned at 11 p.m.</EMPHASIS>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the objectives of the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill is the facilitation of the transfer of prisoners between Australia and certain designated countries with which Australia has entered into agreements for the transfer of prisoners so that they may serve their sentences of imprisonment in their country of nationality or in countries with which they have community ties. The bill also facilitates the transport of prisoners to Australia from countries in which prisoners are serving sentences of imprisonment imposed by certain war crimes tribunals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The criminal law is a very peculiar creature. Unless it touches you, you know that it exists but you rarely understand its workings. But once you get caught up in its vortex, as many of my clients for whom I acted over a number of years have been, there is an inevitable drawing further into that vortex. The tube, if you like, into which all defendants are taken on their journey through the criminal justice system has a number of sharp points along the way, and frequently the journey is punctuated by ups and downs. It is rarely, if ever, an occasion of much pleasure to be in that system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, I am reminded of one of the greatest writers of the 19th century, Charles Dickens, in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Old Curiosity Shop</EMPHASIS>, when he was talking about a rather amusing situation that used to occur outside the solicitor Sampson Brass's chambers. Sampson Brass used to have a tenant who was rather eccentric and who used to summon diverse people to come and perform Punch and Judy shows outside the chambers. As Dickens so beautifully put it, Brass could ill afford to lose so profitable a tenant so he deemed it prudent to pocket the affront along with the cash that the tenant provided. But he used other ways of trying to disperse the throng below which disrupted his business, such as the pouring down of foul waters from above, or bribing the drivers of coaches to come tearing around the corner and break up the assembled throng. Dickens so beautifully put it when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may well ask why he, being the legal gentleman, would not have indicted the party or parties responsible for the nuisance . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But he then proceeded with the warning, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As doctors seldom take their own medicines and divines rarely practice what they preach, so lawyers are shy of meddling with the law on their own account knowing it to be an edged tool of uncertain application, very expensive in the working and known for its properties for close shaving if for not always shaving the right person.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So therein lies a very salutary lesson in the whole of the criminal justice system&mdash;as well as the civil system, I might say, which also has its attendant perils. Many times one sees people who are not guilty of crimes&mdash;indeed, there is barely a shred of evidence against them&mdash;but they are drawn into the system. And once the system starts, and once the engine is cranked, it rarely stops until the process is completed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2987">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the numerous submissions that can go out between charge and committal and between committal and trial, rarely, if ever, in my experience, is one of those submissions successful. So that preamble in essence is a warning to all those who think the system can work, that we have checks and balances, and that there is a way of making a protest about a wrongful conviction or sentence, or an inappropriate piece of evidence that has been adduced, and so forth. Believe you me, once the situation starts, and particularly once a person is convicted, the road becomes even rougher in trying to set aside an inappropriate conviction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say all that not with a view to casting any aspersion upon the integrity of the legislation but with a view to giving a warning to all those who think that it is a nice piece of legislation. I am not saying it is not a nice piece of legislation, but I am giving a warning to those who feel that there is nothing wrong with it and that it has great objects. Yes, it does have great objects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee I participated in some hearings on this legislation. I did not get to the Parklea Correctional Centre at Blacktown in Sydney, but I understand the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) was there and he may make some observations about that. I understand some evidence was taken at that venue from persons who have been personally affected with respect to a prisoner who has been sentenced in another country and is enduring a sentence of imprisonment there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think anybody on the committee argues with the proposition that the punishment must fit the crime and that people who commit criminal offences ought to be punished, if they have committed the offences and if the process leading to their conviction is untainted. Despite perhaps being almost myopic, some might say, in my views about this, my concern remains about the chances of unsafe convictions and miscarriages of justice which are always present. They are not common, but they are always present&mdash;and that is a concern I have in relation to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lawyers, certainly in Queensland, do remember the terrible case of Kelvin Condren, an Aboriginal chap who was convicted of murder in Mount Isa some years ago, and another prisoner confessed in the Northern Territory to that particular crime. One would think, in our jurisprudence, that that would result in an immediate release or, at the very least, an immediate and speedy hearing, a review of the case by the court of appeal, and swift action by the Attorney&hyphen;General. In fact, there were two hearings over a period of something like seven years before Kelvin Condren was finally released and paid a substantial amount of compensation. It took seven years for that process to be corrected in our jurisprudence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fortiori, when it comes to convictions in relation to another country; while I appreciate strongly the force of the legislation and how, for it to work, it must give due recognition to convictions that have been recorded in the other country and that there is the reciprocal situation, I do have concerns about the operation of the act in so far as tainted convictions are concerned in another country&mdash;or, for that matter, in this country. But I am focusing particularly on the situation where a prisoner is convicted in another country. The pressure on him to acknowledge his guilt in order for the operation of this legislation to come into full flow, as it were, is obvious on the face of it. He obviously would prefer to spend his time in Wacol Correctional Centre or Parklea than in the `Bangkok Hilton'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that if we have had miscarriages of justice in our jurisdiction there may be more examples of such miscarriages in a foreign jurisdiction. I do not necessarily say that there is,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2988"> but I do say that we have the best criminal justice system in the world in Australia. I believe it far outstrips the English and the US systems, but there are still miscarriages of justice that do occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to be very careful to see that this legislation will work properly and, in particular, that we do not in certain circumstances deny justice to a prisoner who has come here and who then finds himself in a situation where the conviction in the other country has been found to be tainted by fraud or bias by a tribunal in that country. Perhaps a piece of evidence which was absolutely critical has been wrongly admitted, or perhaps a confession has been made allegedly by him to another person and that other person then renounces it, having taken the benefit of a remission in his sentence in that other country. Obviously, the inducement to bear false witness about the defendant's confession would have been very strong in those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to be very careful that we do not exclude the possibility of that imprisoned person being able to make an application to the Attorney and perhaps the Attorney then being able to encourage the attorney or the corresponding legal figure of the other country to take action in respect of the original conviction. That is my concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that other members of the committee did not have that concern, and I respect their views&mdash;it may be that I have taken an overly cautious approach. I do not believe, with the experience that I have, that I have missed anything in that process. I hope I have not, but I do have concern that we may have a situation where a key witness has renounced testimony, or there has been some taint in the conviction and no action is taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that is common to both our justice system and to other justice systems is that it hates to be wrong. It hates to admit that it has made a mistake. It hates to concede that there may have been an error in the process. Examples of mistakes are legion in the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the worst cases of all was the Hanratty case. James Hanratty was the last person to be hung in England. He was committed for trial in October of a particular year and by April of the next year he had gone to the gallows. Afterwards, as a result of reading a very fine book by Paul Foot, a journalist who did a comprehensive analysis of that case, you could not possibly conclude that Hanratty was guilty of the offence. At the very least you would be left with a reasonable doubt about it, yet it was too late for Hanratty. The whole process was tainted by a system that was desperately trying to protect itself from any suggestion that it had made a mistake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can go on to more recent times with the Birmingham Six and cases like that where the system has been corrupted but where nobody will do anything about it, year in, year out, and at the end of the day some poor devil has to languish in prison for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sound that note of warning in relation to this legislation. I think there should be a discretion that is very carefully exercised in relation to matters of that nature. If there is a situation where someone has been found to have been wrongly convicted in the other country, where maybe someone else has confessed to the crime, or where there has been a taint in the procedure, then there must be swift procedures available if the other country fails to act to correct that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That situation, I am told, is perhaps protected by the wording of the legislation in clause 15. I am not totally satisfied with that. However, as a matter of prudence, it has to be very
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2989"> carefully scrutinised and very carefully looked at before we can say that this legislation is totally free from any concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the legislation. I think that, in general terms, it is good legislation. I do have, of course, some doubts. I know that they were expressed by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Randall) in relation to the fact that, as far as costs are concerned, it looks as if we may well be bearing most of the costs because of the natural tendency for prisoners to want to stay here rather than go home and for prisoners who are overseas to want to come back here rather than stay over there. So it would seem, on its face, an arguable situation. But I will not steal my honourable friend's thunder in relation to that. I think he could do it better than I could anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, overall, I do support the human rights aspect of this particular procedure. But I warn the Main Committee that there are situations that can arise that are never foreseen and can never be foreseen. When they happen, unfortunately everybody wants to disappear and not look at the real problems. So, generally speaking, with those reservations, I support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion before the committee. I also support, as I am frequently found to do, the comments of the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith). I also share his caution and concerns with aspects of the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill and the operation of clause 15(1)(a) specifically, which requires that, before a prisoner can access the transfer mechanism, the prisoner has had to either have terminated his other appeal rights under the law of that country where he was convicted or make an election to forfeit any remaining appeal rights that he or she has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also share the concerns of the member for Dickson that the pressure on a prisoner to get back to their home country may be such that it forces them to abandon such appeal rights. The pressure, for instance, if there are domestic problems with their family, or an illness in the family, or whatever it may be, may be such that desperation compels that prisoner to abandon their appeal rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are circumstances where things can come to light. The member for Dickson, because of his legal background, was able to refer us to the Kelvin Condron case, the Hanratty case in the United Kingdom and, more recently in the United Kingdom, the Birmingham Six case. These sorts of facts are, unfortunately, even in our very sophisticated system of justice, real possibilities and, without wanting to belittle any other nation's system of justice, even more possible where the court procedures of cross&hyphen;examination and testing of evidence are not as sophisticated as ours. That is a real caution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, of which I am a member, that we recommended in recommendation 4, I think it was, that the Attorney&hyphen;General, when he reports to parliament after 12 months of operation of the legislation, looks in particular at the operation of clause 15 of the bill. I urge those involved to pay particular attention to the issues raised by the member for Dickson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite that reservation and note of caution, like other members, I will be supporting the bill. There are significant humanitarian reasons to support the legislation. One is from the point of view of the prisoner, who obviously has additional hardship as a prisoner in a gaol with a foreign culture which affects simple things like diet and religious customs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We received a letter from a prisoner in a Thai gaol who said that the beds were too small for him because Asian prisoners are usually smaller than Westerners. He was well over six feet tall. His feet went over the end of the bed. Every time someone walked past, he was
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2990"> woken up. Those sorts of things add an additional element of hardship that is not contemplated in the initial sentence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps even more relevant is the hardship that confronts the family of a prisoner gaoled overseas. We heard first&hyphen;hand evidence from the mother of that prisoner in Thailand about the effect that her son's imprisonment had had on her two children in Australia. Regrettably, one had attempted suicide and the other required counselling. The woman herself had obviously been deeply affected by her son's imprisonment overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The humanitarian reasons are not there simply for the sake of feeling warm and having a feeling of satisfaction at doing the right thing. The reality is that that family has to function in Australia and, clearly, any dislocation to family members here can have a flow&hyphen;on effect in terms of the sorts of citizens that they have the opportunity of becoming in subsequent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue of concern&mdash;not with the legislation but with the procedures&mdash;is that it requires the cooperation of all Attorneys&hyphen;General in Australia for the system to work properly. Some states may have to incur additional costs as a result of prisoners returning home and being imprisoned in that particular state. It would be regrettable if a particularly short&hyphen;sighted approach were taken by any state, such that it refused to accept the return of a prisoner. It has a much broader application than a simple exercise based on the cost of housing one particular prisoner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be regrettable if any state Attorney&hyphen;General did not play ball, as it were. It is arguable that this parliament has the constitutional authority to override any state which does not accept the system, but it would be regrettable if legislation overriding state rights were necessary. It would be much more acceptable and successful if there were an element of cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) examine migration in respect of the rights of people who are taken out of Australia as children&mdash;whether they be Aborigines or children taken, in some cases against their will, by a parent. There is a well&hyphen;known recent example of that situation where children have been taken out of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a purely theoretical sense, it is possible that one or other of those children may be convicted of a crime. The view of the committee was that, if that occurred, it would be desirable if some special consideration could be given to such people who were taken out of Australia against their will, so that they could return and serve a prison sentence in Australia. But that issue involves much broader considerations regarding the migration legislation, hence our recommendation that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs looks in particular at that aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already commented on the recommendation that in his report the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) looks closely at the operation of clause 15 and the effect of compelling people to abandon or terminate their appeal rights; and again I would flag that. The fifth recommendation of the legal and constitutional committee was that regulations be added to the legislation to compel a situation where prisoners, before electing to return to their home country, be given information regarding the state of prisons in that home country, and that was something that all members of the committee thought essential.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2991">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it fair to say that the general consensus was that it is inappropriate for our Attorney&hyphen;General to be overly paternal if a prisoner, armed with information as to the state of gaols in their home country, with open eyes nonetheless elects to return to that country. The Attorney&hyphen;General should not step in and say, `You cannot do it, because we do not regard prisons in your home country as being up to international standards or proper humane standards.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A good example of that was given to the committee where, for instance, in some states of the United States it is the practice to put prisoners in leg irons. There is an argument that that is contrary to international standards relating to the treatment of prisoners, but it may well be the case that an American prisoner in Australia may nonetheless elect or wish to return to their home state. It would be inappropriate for, as I say, the federal Attorney&hyphen;General&mdash;or, for that matter, any state Attorney&hyphen;General&mdash;to be overly paternalistic in restricting a prisoner from applying to return home if that prisoner, with eyes open about what they would face, genuinely wanted to return home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next aspect, in recommendation 6 of the committee report, was the annual reporting mechanism, and I think that is appropriate&mdash;indeed, essential&mdash;because I suspect there will be some initial teething problems with perhaps some states and territories not complying to the best of their ability, if I can put it that way, with the system. It would be important to look at what steps can be taken to get everyone on board and get the system operating properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be said that it is probably an area where there are no votes at all for either political party, but it is just one of those acts of parliament which are appropriate. I suppose it had its origins under the former government, but the current Attorney&hyphen;General has well and truly taken up the issue with some expedition; and obviously both sides of the House regard the legislation as appropriate, even though there are probably no votes in it at the end of the day. Again, I would be very concerned if any state authority or state parliamentarian said, `There are no votes in it for us, so why should we cooperate?' That would be, as I have stressed, regrettable indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a real potential for obstruction in the system, because there are effectively four tiers of consent. In the case of a prisoner overseas, firstly, the prisoner has to make an election. The overseas government has to approve, the federal Attorney-General here has to approve, then the state Attorney-General of the relevant state has to approve. So anywhere in that system there is the potential for the mechanism to be waylaid. Again, it is appropriate that that reporting mechanism be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final recommendation was that clause 24 be looked at, and I understand that the relevant drafting experts in the department are looking at that issue. There is currently a double discretion contained in the particular clause, where the Attorney-General virtually has an unreviewable discretion because of the way that it is presently drafted. That would be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should say that the explanatory memorandum conveys the view that there is probably very little cost implication for the legislation, and that may or may not be the case. On the basis of the number of foreign prisoners in our gaols as compared with the number of Australians in foreign gaols, on one view we have the potential to benefit more than other countries because, in theory, more would desire to return home&mdash;assuming of course that they regarded their home gaols as acceptable. But I argue that there is another significant potential for a cost benefit to Australia, and that is in the sense that there is presently quite a burden on foreign embassies and commissions to assist Australians in overseas gaols. We heard some evidence
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2992"> as to whether the assistance being offered was satisfactory or not, and I understand that there is a Senate select committee looking at that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can speak from first-hand experience, as last August I went to Thailand as a member of a delegation. I became quite friendly with one of the officers of the Australian embassy in Thailand, a Mr James Larsen. He described to me the efforts that the embassy officials over there went to to look after Australian prisoners. He struck me as a very genuine and diligent young man. I have no doubt whatsoever that he and other representatives of the embassy were very much looking after the interests of prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Larsen told us, by way of example, that the week before we had arrived a prisoner that he had visited on a number of occasions and whom he had assisted had escaped from the Thai gaol in quite exceptional and athletic circumstances. In terms of mere escape, it was really quite an achievement. He took the opportunity after his escape of dropping a note to the Australian embassy to thank them for all their tremendous work and said that he hoped he had not caused them any embarrassment by his escape. That was an indication of the appreciation and warmth that he had for their efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that our Australian missions devote quite considerable resources to looking after prisoners. Therefore, if the number of Australian prisoners in overseas gaols were reduced, the burden placed on our overseas embassies would also be reduced. That is a factor which can appropriately be regarded in considering the impact of this legislation. But, as I say, with the words of caution that my friend, the member for Dickson noted, which I support, I strongly endorse and support the motion to approve the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak to certain aspects of the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill because it provides a framework for Australia to participate in the international transfer of prisoners. While the primary purpose of the bill is to enable Australians imprisoned overseas to be returned to Australia to complete their sentences, it will also provide a system wherein foreign nationals imprisoned in Australia will be returned to their home countries to complete their sentences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reduced numbers of Australian prisoners overseas will also reduce the pressure on Australia's consular costs. There presently is an undersupply of consular staff. Australian prisoners outnumber consular staff available to visit the prisons and assist Australians overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a possible financial saving to the states if there is a net outflow of prisoners. There are approximately 272 international prisoners in Australian gaols compared with approximately 160 to 180 Australians presently imprisoned overseas. To keep one prisoner in an Australian prison for one year costs between $50,000 and $60,000. While people recoil in horror at this amount of money, it goes largely on wages to prison officers who must, for the safety of the general community, be at quite a high ratio per prisoner. It is, however, a lot of money that the government pays to the prison system, when you look at the thousands of prisoners across Australia. It is for this reason also that constant and stringent reporting of the transmigration of prisoners is to be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, of which I am a member, has been receiving and hearing evidence on this issue. It does have some divergent opinions about this matter, due to the emotive responses which arise from issues on crimes and sentencing. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, at the moment throughout Australia there appears to be a great move towards stronger and more stringent sentences, and this is borne out in such initiatives as `three strikes and you're in' type
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2993"> legislation. There is a greater push for longer nonparole periods, because the parole system in this country is seen to be soft and, in some cases, a bit of a joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a strong feeling in Australia, as well as overseas, that a policy of international transfers of prisoners would undermine the integrity of the penal system. For example&mdash;and I will refer to this issue later&mdash;integrity must be maintained by making sure that no alterations are made to the sentences of transferring prisoners, and this has been mentioned by previous speakers. Further, there is a belief that international transfers would undermine efforts to fight serious crime, particularly drug related crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested that the significant increase in the number of known foreign prisoners has resulted from the rapid increase in international air travel since the 1970s, and from the rise in illegal drug use over the same period&mdash;and they do seem rather coincidental. Australian citizens do not carry Australian law with them when they travel. They must be very aware of this: that they become subject to the law of the state in the country they are visiting. This places on them the obligation of being required to observe the laws of the countries that they are visiting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the bill supports the notion of the international transfer of prisoners on humanitarian grounds as well, which is one of the reasons for my supporting it. Australian prisoners should be allowed to return home and serve out their sentences. I just bring to your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, the concept which was exhibited in the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Midnight Express</EMPHASIS> of the sorts of horrific prison conditions which were faced by a foreign national. Also, many references have been made to the prison in Bangkok, quite often referred to as the `Bangkok Hilton', and the conditions faced there by prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A prisoner can be adversely affected psychologically and physically by deprivation of liberty, through experiences with language barriers, differences in diet, health, intolerance of religious practices, lack of contact with family and friends, lack of access to welfare or community goodwill organisations and to training and, simply, general prejudice against foreigners. These adverse effects will hinder their chances of successful rehabilitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mind you, there are some people who think the totally unacceptable conditions in a country outside Australia, and possibly in a Third World country, might deter people from ever re&hyphen;offending. However, there are some celebrated cases of people in countries who deliberately did not want to transfer&mdash;and I draw to the attention of the Main Committee Charles Sobhraj, who recently left an Indian gaol because he did not want to return to a country where he was to be killed. He did some extraordinary things, which have been written about extensively, to stay in India, which he is currently fighting to do at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A policy of international transfer of prisoners would give them access to facilities they would not have overseas, placing them in the more familiar environments of their country of origin. Again I say, with their return home, it is believed that their chances of rehabilitation are somewhat higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Around 1,000 Australians are arrested overseas each year. In September 1995 there were 164 Australians imprisoned overseas, about which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had information. Current figures show that just over 40 per cent of these persons were imprisoned for drug related offences. The country which holds the majority of our prisoners overseas is Thailand&mdash;and it is no coincidence at all that Thailand seems to be the hub for the so-called, and famous, Golden Triangle, from where a large part of the world's heroin emanates.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2994">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have a natural link with New Zealand where, on current figures, 23 Australians are imprisoned. In the United States there are 21 Australians. Also, in Greece we have, I believe, the high number of 18 Australians imprisoned. This can also be seen in light of the fact that it is often said that the second largest Greek&hyphen;populated city in the world is Melbourne, and I am sure that we have a number of paternal links to Greece. We currently have approximately 10 prisoners in the United Kingdom&mdash;and, again, I would point to our historical links to the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The length of these prisoners' sentences varies from a few months to life imprisonment. Local sentencing is to be taken into consideration when an Australian prisoner is returned to Australia. Their sentence is not going to be in any way lighter than in the country where the crime was committed, and there is some misconception out in the public with the belief that, under the Australian system of imprisonment, there is the chance that their sentence could be altered. This fact needs to be forced home to those who have this misconception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that prisoners do not think that returning to Australia is a way of getting lighter sentences. The rest of the community would be hostile, extremely hostile, if they thought criminals were reducing the severity of their sentences by coming home. After all, we are not talking about the nice care&hyphen;giving people of the world; we are talking about people who have been convicted of crimes and, in many cases, very serious crimes. In that regard, we are not trying to featherbed their future time of incarceration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not here to apologise for Australian prisoners, but we are here to take into account humanitarian reasons for assistance during their sentences and their rehabilitation after prison and towards their families. One of our greatest considerations is those people they sadly leave behind here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to be able to say that there will be four checks to this system of international transfer of prisoners. First of all, the prisoner must agree to return to Australia or to their country of origin. Secondly, the Attorney-General in the country in which the offence was committed must agree to the prisoner's return. Thirdly, the Australian Attorney-General must also agree. Fourthly, the Attorney-General in the state of Australia housing the prisoner must also agree. This makes me feel much more relaxed about the checks and balances that will be in place in this system in terms of international transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point in time, however, the current situation is that the Northern Territory does not want to participate in this system of transfer of prisoners. As the Australian city closest to South-East Asia where there is a steady flow of people committing offences, most commonly drug trafficking and illegal immigration, its people are, perhaps understandably, quite cynical about the value of this bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would inform the member for Fisher that currently they are not a great party to this bill. While the Northern Territory's actions will not prevent the legislation being passed, it is of course preferable that, as part of Australia, they do contribute to the system of uniform sentencing arrangements. I understand that the Australian Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is currently involved in negotiations with the Northern Territory, and hopefully an outcome will be known soon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the number of Australian prisoners held overseas is slightly lower than that of overseas prisoners held here, it is on balance quite even. It is important that the status be vigilantly monitored to ensure that there is no significant imbalance, so that Australia does
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2995"> not become a dumping ground when Australian prisoners are not being returned. One of my concerns in the legal and constitutional committee has been that there might be an imbalance in the flow of international prisoners. I am sure that Australian prisons could quite often be seen as far better places to serve out some time, given electronic devices such as televisions and PCs, and the quality of food that we feed our prisoners. I am not sure&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PK6">Mr RANDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the case, whereas the converse does apply, as the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) already spoke about, with Australians in overseas prisons not being able to fit themselves into a bed and being held in poor sanitary conditions. One of my great concerns is that we monitor the flow of prisoner traffic, both into and out of Australia, so that there is a balance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The allowance paid to prisoners in Australia is comparable with&mdash;or, in many cases, greater than&mdash;the actual average earnings of some people in Asian countries, and we must ensure our prisons are not seen as too attractive, as I have already said. This case has been highlighted in Broome on a number of occasions, where Indonesian prisoners who were caught and sentenced actually saved money in Australia and went back on their chartered jumbos much richer than when they arrived, despite having had their boats burnt. We need to be aware of anomalies like that, and we must also ensure that the balance is vigilantly monitored so that the overcrowding problem which already exists in Australian prisons does not see the presence here of international prisoners preventing the return of Australian prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this bill, given certain reservations which I have alluded to and given its checks and balances and the fact that there should be accountability in terms of annual reporting. Currently it is very difficult, in some cases, to get accurate figures, both on overseas prisoners and on prisoners not of Australian nationality in Australia gaols, because of the nature of reporting between the states and the Commonwealth. I would urge strongly that we have an auditing type of response on an annual basis to check the flow of international prisoners, and that the Attorney&hyphen;General be given charge of this. As I say, I commend the bill for all the positive reasons I have mentioned.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, prisons and correctional policy generally is primarily a matter for the states, and that situation produces quite a degree of diversity in different parts of Australia. For example, in comparing the rates of imprisonment and the size of prison populations per capita in New South Wales and Victoria, one finds that the per capita rate of imprisonment in New South Wales is significantly higher than that in Victoria, and that has historically been the case, by and large, irrespective of the political orientation of the particular state government at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess that that reflects quite deep&hyphen;seated differences in prisons philosophy and corrections philosophy. Victoria's approach has been to put very significant emphasis on community corrections, obviously, for less serious offences&mdash;in comparison with the approach that has been taken in New South Wales, for example. There have also been some differences in approaches for sentencing within the courts of different jurisdictions. There is a significant variation between Australian states in relation to publicly operated prison systems and privately operated prison systems. Queensland was probably the trailblazer in relation to private prisons in Australia&mdash;interestingly enough, under a Labor government, I think. And Victoria, under the current coalition government, has very much&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QK6">Mr SERCOMBE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was it? Fine, I stand corrected by the member for Fisher. There is a wide range of variations within Australia, and certainly between Australia and other jurisdictions. The United States of America has a huge variation in the quality of the prisons it operates. A few years ago, in my capacity as the Victorian shadow minister for corrections, I had the opportunity  to visit a number of prisons in the US. The diversity in the prisons there is absolutely mind&hyphen;boggling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Minnesota, a state in the Union which has had a small `l' liberal tradition in a whole range of areas, including social policy, the prisons put great emphasis on rehabilitation. In contrast, in some of the southern states, and California, some of the prisons are electronic zoos where the ratio of prisoners to staff is very high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very few staff in those prisons because the prisoners are monitored electronically. Arguably, that has terribly negative impacts on rehabilitation, because people in that sort of environment who are denied human contact are unlikely to come out of gaol better citizens as the result of the experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That point goes very much to the heart of what a lot of this bill is about. A number of years ago there was some debate in Australia about an Aborigine called James Savage who was convicted of murder in the United States. His possible repatriation to Australia generated a great deal of attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time, the Catholic chaplain of prisons in Victoria was interviewed on the ABC program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS> on the general question of bringing prisoners home. The comments of Father Peter Norden are apposite today. Norden said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I work as a prison chaplain here in Victoria and I see that those prisoners who are in contact with their family, who have the ability for their family to visit them in prison are, in fact, far more manageable within the prison environment than people who are completely isolated from their families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And then, you know, as the sentence proceeds and the person is preparing for release back in to the community&mdash;because they are still members of the community. As they are preparing for release back in to the community the prospects of some form of resettlement, effective resettlement, are heightened so much if the person is in contact with people who are close to them: their own family, their wife, their husband, their children.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That seems like commonsense. It clearly underpins the importance of this particular legislation. Australian citizens who return to Australia have a much greater capacity to rehabilitate into the community. If they are in close proximity to significant other people in their lives, they will have a more effective chance of becoming contributing members of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are obviously cost advantages to the proposal as well. Other speakers have spoken about the effect on consular services. There is some debate in the report of the House of Representatives committee about the competing levels of prisoners going out of Australia as distinct from those coming in. The balance of views seems to be that it is likely to favour Australia, perhaps marginally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other factor which I want to re&hyphen;emphasise is the advantage to the Australian community in terms of getting people rehabilitated as effective members of the community and the costs that are involved in the community with recidivism&mdash;that is, repeat offending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well established internationally that, where prisoners are given effective opportunities to rehabilitate, to learn meaningful employment skills, where they can maintain their health&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2997"> which they are going to be in a much better position to do in an Australian prison than overseas&mdash;the ultimate benefits to the Australian community in terms of avoiding the costs of repeat offences, in terms of health breakdowns, in terms of getting prisoners into employment and supporting their families, are going to be significantly greater if they are operating within an Australian environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other members have spoken about Thai prisons. I visited a prison in Bangkok a few years ago. I can assure you that that is not an environment that is likely to produce rehabilitation for Australian offenders incarcerated there. They are, by and large, almost exclusively, people convicted of drug offences, but they are scarcely the Mr Bigs of the drug scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it would probably be true to describe most of the Australians I had the opportunity to meet in Bangkok prisons as `mules'&mdash;that is the colloquial expression. They are typically drug dependent people who have been caught trying to support their habit by carrying narcotics out of that jurisdiction. Their prospects of ever becoming effective citizens back in Australia are not going to be supported by their remaining for lengthy periods of time in the corrupt environment of Thai gaols.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of features of the advisory report by the House of Representatives committee that I wanted to comment on. One is to note that it is good to see Australia, through this legislation, assuming some responsibilities arising from war crimes tribunal matters in both the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. This legislation gives effect in a number of ways to Australia's capacity to meet international obligations in those circumstances, and that is something that both sides of the House can applaud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other speakers have spoken about the national application of this legislation and the desirability of it, and we have heard that the Northern Territory apparently is continuing to indicate that it does not wish to participate. There is some reference in the committee's report to the possibility that Western Australia may have some difficulties. It was certainly canvassed in submissions to the committee, particularly from the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Sidoti, who was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the bill should provide explicitly for extension to all Australian internal territories, either directly or by way of regulation, if the territories do not legislate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The recommendation of the committee is against that particular approach. But it would seem to me that the Commonwealth ought not to totally forgo some considerable leverage on territories or states that do not come into this on a voluntary basis, simply because I think the overall advantages generally in Australia are somewhat diminished if particular jurisdictions, for whatever reason, decide to stay out. I think that it really is an area which it is sufficiently important to attempt very vigorously to get a national approach on, even if that involves some fairly heavy negotiation with the states. I am not sure, but I would suspect that my side of the parliament would ultimately fairly vigorously support that approach, if it became necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important consideration that was dealt with in the standing committee's report was the question of eligibility of transfer under the legislation. I referred earlier to the James Savage matter in the United States. He was a young man of Aboriginal origin who was taken as a very young child from Australia and adopted by some people in the United States.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SLIPPER" NAMEID="0V5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V5">Mr Slipper</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was a US citizen, wasn't he?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QK6">Mr SERCOMBE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I think he became a US citizen. That raised some particular issues which were also addressed by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in its submission to the parliamentary committee. The Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2998"> immigration department in their submissions to the committee came out very vigorously in opposition to making specific provisions for people of Aboriginal origin in the sorts of circumstances that Mr Savage found himself in. A Mr Meaney from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we [would] have is a right for a class of persons&mdash;Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders&mdash;who have been convicted of offences overseas to return to Australia but no general right of getting back into Australia under the Migration Act for, if you like, law abiding persons of the same extraction who might have been in the same class.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that point is reasonably well made. But I think the logical conclusion of it is not as the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department seems to be suggesting&mdash;that is, not taking steps to facilitate the capacity of people of Aboriginal extraction to return to Australia in the sorts of circumstances that Savage found himself in&mdash;but, rather, to create opportunities for non&hyphen;offending people in the same sort of category to also have some rights of return, given what we are increasingly learning about the terrible consequences of so much of the assimilation policy that was adopted in earlier decades towards Aboriginal children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, a number of those children did leave the Australian jurisdiction. I would think the implication of this is not to put barriers in the way of the type of person that Savage is; but, rather, to look at the more general proposition of those who have not been convicted and look at some sort of restitution of rights. The committee does recommend that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) initiate some examination of the issues surrounding the eligibility of persons who have been removed from Australia as children to have a right of entry to Australia. That is welcome. I would join the committee in supporting that and would urge the minister to move on that particular matter very promptly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final matter in the committee's report that I wanted to comment on was the question of the Attorney&hyphen;General's discretion under a number of aspects of this legislation. The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) and the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) have both referred to a particular area where it would seem desirable for the Attorney&hyphen;General to keep a discretion under review to ensure that injustices were not being done. Elizabeth Evatt, in a submission to the parliamentary committee, said the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to think that all the discretions that will be exercised under the Act will be exercised in a manner compatible with our international human rights obligations . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like this committee to make a strong statement like that as a guiding principle to the way that the Act should be exercised. If it is in your report, it will be there for all time for whoever is exercising discretions and it will be there if any act of any government officer or Attorney&hyphen;General comes up for judicial review as a question of exercise legally. They will be able to look at that to see that it was the intention that we should at all times be compatible with human rights standards and not risk a violation by a transfer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I wholeheartedly endorse those comments and believe that it would be very helpful, at the close of the second reading debate, if the Attorney&hyphen;General was able to give the committee the pleasure of his company to get some assurances from him in relation to the basis on which he would propose under this legislation to exercise his discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that one of the reasons, which the committee did not particularly address, that that discretion is important is that the circumstances in particular countries with which Australia might enter into treaty arrangements may change over time. One could look, for example, at Greece which was referred to as a place where there are a number of Australian citizens who are prisoners. Greece may well be a democracy now, but a few decades ago it
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2999"> was run by a military junta. Clearly, the sorts of circumstances that operate in particular countries change from time to time. We may well wish to look at the situation that exists in a country where the treaty obligations are incurred, by having the Attorney&hyphen;General of the day make it quite clear that his discretions in that respect will be influenced very strongly by the human rights position in particular countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred earlier to my visit to the prisons in the United States a number of years ago and to the very wide diversity of prison experiences there. They range from very progressive prisons, in the sense of prisons focused very much on getting high levels of rehabilitation so that rates of recidivism are reduced, right through to places which, as I described earlier, you would even hesitate to call electronic zoos&mdash;places that are quite brutalising and dehumanising for the prisoners in them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over time, even within a single country, I would think circumstances are going to change. That simply reinforces the importance of the Attorney&hyphen;General having a discretion in a range of areas here and reinforcing the basis of it. So I will conclude my remarks by urging the Attorney&hyphen;General to come to the Main Committee, if he is able to, and give some assurances. That would be extremely helpful in relation to laying the basis on which Australia will exercise its responsibilities under this legislation and the treaties that will arise as a result of this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I heard of the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill, I was one of those concerned that perhaps there would not be the benefits in the legislation that its proponents have, in fact, advanced. But I have been convinced that this legislation will be of benefit both to this country and to those overseas. Of course, the legislation, as has been pointed out by my colleagues, will allow Australians serving prison sentences overseas to be returned to Australia and will permit foreign nationals imprisoned in this country to return to their own countries to complete their sentences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two aspects to this particular legislation. Firstly, it covers general prisoner transfers. With respect to those general prisoner transfers, the transfer scheme is able to apply to all offences without exception. It covers persons who have been convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment or other deprivation of liberty and includes persons confined in connection with criminal conduct by reason of mental disorder and persons who have been released on parole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been previously pointed out, these transfers will be consensual, requiring the consent of the person to be transferred, the relevant Australian government&mdash;Commonwealth and state/territory&mdash;and the other country. Conditions for transfer include imprisonment under a final order and for there to be at least six months of the sentence remaining to be served, unless the Attorney&hyphen;General determines that transfer for a shorter period is acceptable. Transfer conditions to Australia include the person being an Australian citizen or permitted to travel to, enter and remain in Australia indefinitely, pursuant to the Migration Act 1958, and having community ties with a state or territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first read that non&hyphen;citizens in certain circumstances would be able to return to Australia, I thought of citizens of countries like New Zealand whose non&hyphen;citizens, though nonAustralians, are still able to reside here. If New Zealand, for instance, does not enter into a similar scheme to that being entered into by Australia, it could be that New Zealanders languishing in Thai or South&hyphen;East Asian prisons might well want to come to Australia, which is closer to home. Our prisons are clearly very much more humane.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3000">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased to see section 57, which points out that the Attorney&hyphen;General must not make any decision under this act affecting a prisoner who is not an Australian citizen without the consent of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. So, the concern that I had, and I believe the concern that would be widespread in the community, ultimately turned out not to be something to worry about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say, though, that it is important to recognise that in 1997 Australia is a humanitarian country and that there will be humanitarian, economic and social advantages of an international transfer scheme for prisoners in which this country participates. Prior to my return to the federal parliament, I was for a period Chairman of the West Moreton Regional Community Corrections Board, which was the parole board covering prisons in Brisbane and, for a while, elsewhere. The two major prisons we covered were the Sir David Longland and Wacol correctional centres. At times we did have responsibility for the infamous Boggo Road Goal and the Borallon private prison, referred to by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to correctional matters, it is always important to strike the appropriate balance between a penalty and rehabilitation. I think most people in the community would agree we need a balance. The difference that sometimes arises might be just on where that particular balance should be struck. But, when one looks at the prisons that the honourable member opposite has seen in some other parts of the world, the prisons that we know exist in certain parts of South&hyphen;East Asia, I suppose as Australians with a Western culture we have to ask whether those prison conditions are suitable for Australian prisoners. This legislation, to an extent, moves very much along the road towards encouraging a humanitarian approach to those Australian prisoners who are incarcerated overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people could criticise this particular piece of legislation on the basis that we could be perceived to be going soft on crime. For instance, if people go to countries in South&hyphen;East Asia where there are very severe penalties for drug trafficking, at the moment, of course, they know that if they are convicted they will have to serve out the penalty in that particular country. There is of course a lot of money in the drug trade. I believe that the tough conditions existing in prisons and the very severe penalties imposed for drug trafficking in South&hyphen;East Asian countries might well be a powerful disincentive to many Australians to participate in that grotesque trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, a prisoner transfer scheme which will permit the repatriation of prisoners to Australia might encourage some people to say, `The penalty at the end of the day is going to be treatment in a fairly soft Australian prison.' Certainly it is soft by comparison with some overseas prisons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, this government and its predecessor made judgments that, on balance, this legislation should proceed. This legislation has really had quite a long gestation period. It was first raised in 1992 by the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General and it has taken almost five years to reach a stage where it has almost become part of the law of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has been in office for only the last 12 months and while I want to commend our predecessor government for initially bringing this legislation forward, I suppose citizens could well ask why it took from 1992 until the present for this legislation to be introduced. I suppose that the member who is going to speak after me might bring forward some reasons for that. Such delay seems to occur in many cases. An enormous period elapses
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3001"> between when we as a community decide that the law should be changed until the time that the particular law is actually altered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned, there will be a number of safeguards. I referred to the situation of general prisoners. There has, of course, been another section added to the bill and it relates to prisoners of international war crimes tribunals. There will be slightly different procedures with respect to those prisoners. One of the key things to note is that there will be no need for a tribunal prisoner to actually consent to the repatriation to Australia and there will be no explicit citizenship or migration requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, a couple of minutes ago I referred to section 57 of the bill which says that no non&hyphen;citizen can be repatriated to Australia without the consent of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Other colleagues have also referred to how an overseas sentence will be enforced in Australia. In other words, what will happen to the sentence after transfer to Australia? What will happen if the sentence would be somewhat different in the other country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two situations that could occur. A sentence can either continue to be enforced or, alternatively, it can be converted to a different sentence in the receiving country. The Council of Europe convention allows either method and some countries may therefore use the continued enforcement method while others may use the conversion approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There would be widespread concern in the Australian community if as a society we moved to the conversion approach because Australians expect that people who are sentenced to a certain term of imprisonment overseas will, in fact, serve the period of incarceration that they were sentenced to in that country rather than take advantage of softer rules in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I understand that although the bill enables both forms of sentence enforcement, subject to any agreement to the contrary it is proposed that Australia would generally use the continued enforcement method. I believe that that would be a great reassurance to Australians who believe that when people are sentenced to a period in gaol that they should serve that period in gaol. I am a great advocate of truth in sentencing, that when a court sentences a prisoner to a certain term of incarceration then the person should serve that period in gaol and not half or a third, as seems to occur so often in this country at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the situation I have outlined in relation to incoming prisoners under the continued enforcement method, the prisoner would, in effect, bring with him or her the sentence from the sending country minus any time served or remissions earned in the sending country up to the date of transfer. From the date of transfer this sentence would be subject to Australia's laws concerning the enforcement of sentences. Australia's laws concerning conditional release or remission would apply to the sentence as if the sentence was a sentence of Australia at the date of transfer. The relevant laws would be those applying to federal offenders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that one of the initiators of this proposal was the Northern Territory government. The Northern Territory government, having got this thing under way, has now withdrawn from the scheme and there have been some concerns that the scheme ought not to proceed in view of the non&hyphen;participation of the Northern Territory government. In fact, originally it was proposed that the scheme would not be implemented unless all of the state and territory governments in Australia were going to be part of it. But the view has been taken that if the Northern Territory wants to stay out then that is a matter for the Northern Territory and, hopefully, the Northern Territory will participate subsequently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the ideal position is to have full participation of all the states and territories. The reason for that is fairly clear. Commonwealth practice with regard to international conventions
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3002"> and treaties has been that Australia will present a united face internationally and thus will not become a party unless all jurisdictions have agreed and undertaken the necessary steps to ensure that their laws are consistent with Australia's international obligations. If states and territories do not participate those who do may be disadvantaged, because Australians imprisoned overseas who wish to serve their time in Australia would attempt to do so in the participating states or territories, even though their community ties were stronger in the non&hyphen;participating states and territories. In addition, it could be said to be discriminating against Australians in overseas prisons who are from the non&hyphen;participating states and territories. So, clearly, while full participation is something to which everyone would aspire, it simply cannot be achieved at this time. Indeed, one hopes that the Northern Territory will fall into line in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also has been said by some speakers that there could be a net revenue gain for Australia, because we will have an outflow of more prisoners abroad than we will have prisoners returning to Australia. Given the enlightened system of custodial treatment in Australia, and given the fact that many people feel that prisons are very soft in Australia compared with many of the countries with whom we will enter into treaties, my own gut feeling is that most Australians abroad would quite naturally want to return to Australia so that they are able to enjoy Australian prison conditions within our prisons, but very few prisoners from non&hyphen;Western countries would seek to return home and to the standards which exist in their prison systems. I think what is highly likely is that we will get a large number of Australians returning to Australia but we will not get very many people at all going to overseas prisons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will mean that there could in fact be an additional cost to the system. I understand that the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) will look at this matter some time down the track&mdash;I certainly hope he does&mdash;to try to make sure that the system is equitable not only to prisoners but also to states and territories in Australia and, indeed, to the Commonwealth as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So my support for the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill is an `on balance' support. I do have certain concerns about it. It is a bill that has been a long time in coming before the parliament. As a community we have decided that the humanitarian goals, the social advantages&mdash;and some would say the economic advantages&mdash;of this legislation outweigh any detriment. So I urge that the bill be supported by the committee and the parliament and I urge the Attorney&hyphen;General to review the operation of this bill in about 12 months to see whether it needs any finetuning. I thank the Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My support for the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill is not `on balance': this is a very worthwhile measure and it is overdue. The concern of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, when it said that it would be pre&hyphen;emptive to assume that all states will get through the process, is a worry. I join with the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) in hoping that all states and territories do participate in this scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all come to these kinds of debates with our life experience and the baggage of what we have been through. On many occasions I had the experience, particularly as a state member of parliament but also as a federal member, of having families from my electorate approach me about the problems of access they had for their family members who were incarcerated. Those people had difficulties even within this country, such as the difficulty of actually travelling on weekends to country towns to meet young offenders who had been gaoled. I have had the experience of involvement with our high commission in the United Kingdom in regard
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3003"> to a local citizen who was gaoled over there. He went there and it came as a massive surprise to his family when he was gaoled for drug related offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the period of 13 years that I have been in the state or federal parliament, I have probably had about 15 of these very direct circumstances, of people living within 50 metres of me, coming from very good families, basically getting mixed up with the wrong groups and being gaoled, putting great stress on their families. That is one of the major emphases I want to make regarding this measure. It is not only a question of supposed featherbedding of Australians as prisoners overseas; it is also the reality of the emotional trauma for their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was well articulated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trends and Issues</EMPHASIS>, July 1992, by David Biles, who I gather from reading the committee report has also been involved at this stage. He said in that document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family members also often feel that it is necessary for them to visit their sons, daughters or spouses in order to provide psychological or material comfort, and they often feel compelled to make repeated pleas for assistance and relief to government authorities and welfare organisations, both in Australia and overseas. Furthermore, the available evidence indicates that prisoners who have strong and supportive relationships with their families are less likely to become recidivists than are prisoners without such relationships.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have heard from other speakers on the question of cultural problems in overseas prisons&mdash;the question, I guess, of the possibility and probability of their being one out in prison inmate cultures, of being victimised, and of whether those corrective services systems really have much consideration of people with our cultural background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation is overdue. I am very supportive of it. There was some side comment from the previous speaker as to the fact it took so long. I notice that the actual final agreement amongst the states and territories and Commonwealth did stretch from 1992 to 1993. I could proffer the possibility that there were a lot of difficulties in getting agreement from the states; we have heard now that some of them are doubtful and others are very reluctant. There is a variety of possibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it has taken a while in this country, it has certainly been on the boil in Europe. There is a 27&hyphen;country convention there, which includes a number of countries that are not European. I understand that there is also a Commonwealth agreement. Internationally this is happening on a very large scale. It is a reality of increasing international movement of people; of, perhaps, increasing interrelationship of criminal organisations as well&mdash;I guess that has got to be a factor in it all&mdash;and also of organised crime setting up in cultures, through population movement, where they have not previously been present. All those factors come into it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note, however, with reference to the advocacy of the need for the international transfer of prisoners that Biles documented in 1992, if you look at the numbers involved, which are to some degree guesswork, you see that there does not seem to have been a great increase in those gaoled either here or overseas in the various categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice a bit of difficulty in the figures supplied to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs&mdash;there seems a bit of a conflict there&mdash;and I think it points to the uncertainty when they talk about people born overseas and those who actually would be eligible to be covered by this legislation. There do not seem to be clear figures in a number of jurisdictions as to whether they relate to people who could go back or those who were born overseas. If you look at the actual figures and add them up for the states that had people interested in the scheme, et cetera, you find more than were originally claimed
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3004"> to be eligible. Equally, as people say, there is debate as to how many Australian citizens there are in overseas prisons. The degree of consular contact, the degree to which they know about people and the degree to which people actually bother to be in contact with our representatives all lead to uncertainty in the figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone around the place is proffering ideas about whether, on balance, we are going to save money. Of course it is highly probable that the number of Australians trying to re&hyphen;enter here will be greater, but the actual figures seem to indicate that we hold far greater numbers of people who would be eligible for return to overseas nations. It really is a lot of guesswork and, at the end of the day, the humanitarian aspect concerning these people's families and the problems they have in overseas jurisdictions wins me in the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerns have been expressed about the possibility that people will give up their appeal rights. There have been references to the number of IRA cases in the United Kingdom and the possibility that people would give up rights and would essentially have possibilities of winning those appeals. It is not just politically related cases like the IRA. You could probably refer to people who went to the gallows in the United Kingdom, through failures in their system, to see that there is a danger that people do not exercise those full rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you see a legal system in the United States where 12 per cent of people are black yet 41 per cent of people facing the death sentence are black, you do question overseas jurisdictions. There is the question of whether people do sacrifice rights that they should exercise to the very limit and whether this might become an incentive for some to sacrifice those rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a variety of protections here. As other speakers have indicated, there is a requirement that there be consent by the individual, by the countries involved et cetera. I note that in the migration area&mdash;and I am a person who has had a fair involvement in this field and takes a deep interest in it&mdash;the correct protections are there. There is the requirement of the minister to have an involvement with regard to those people who are not citizens. I notice reference to the question of those children born overseas, how they fit into the system, and the need for that to be looked at. There is the question of dual criminality&mdash;that offences are roughly commensurate in the two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not really have any doubts in a fundamental sense about this legislation. There are references to annual reporting. We are taking about a phenomenon that is increasing internationally. We have a situation where people who are separated from their families and are alone in jurisdictions are given this opportunity. I think the legislation is worth while. I do hope that all states and territories come on board and that we do not have an over&hyphen;concentration on unnecessary fears about swarms of people somehow descending on the country when they have no right to be here, or on concerns that people will miss out on the great suffering that some people think they should have in Thailand or Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should get a few of these things in perspective. Some people run around expressing concern that it might be better for some people to suffer in Thai gaols. To put this in perspective, there was an interesting article this week in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guardian Weekly</EMPHASIS> about the Burmese regime and its treatment of other people with a bit more than a passing interest in crime. It was noted in the article that Khun Sa was given licences to operate transport companies, trade in real estate and run a $24 million mineral concession under his new name. The article said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3005">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The men who mediated for him in the lead&hyphen;up to his televised surrender, including his former accountant and two Mong Tai officers, say a $20 million contract was drawn up.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The situation is that the main architect of drug peddling in the Burma Thailand border area was accepted by Burmese authorities and basically allowed to go legitimate within the legal system of that country. So to quibble over the fact that a few people&mdash;who, to my mind, are basically desperates in general from what you see of them on television&mdash;might not be suffering from malaria and a series of other diseases in Thai gaols is really not the right emphasis to put on this measure. It is overdue, I support it strongly, and I congratulate the government for bringing it before the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I commence by thanking members who have spoken on this bill, the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill, and I note that, in effect, all have supported it. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) represents the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General and is a regular speaker on bills from my portfolio, but there were also other regular contributors to discussion of bills in my portfolio, including the members for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), Barton (Mr McClelland), Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) and Fisher (Mr Slipper). I am very pleased that this particular bill has also attracted the attention of the member for Swan (Mr Randall) and the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson). We hope to see more contributions from them on the Attorney&hyphen;General's portfolio bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill, as has been mentioned, was the subject of an advisory report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I welcome the committee's report and its strong support of the bill. The report itself recognises the considerable consultation and work that has gone into the development of it, particularly through the comprehensive and detailed consultation process with the states and territories. I am grateful for the thorough and detailed consideration which the committee devoted to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee made seven recommendations and I am pleased to be able to say that I agree with all of them. I propose to just briefly mention each of them. The first is that the parliament pass the bill following due consideration of the recommendations of the committee's report. I naturally agree wholeheartedly with that recommendation. In light of the strong rehabilitative and humanitarian benefits and the possible financial advantages of international prisoner transfers, I would urge the Senate, as well as the House, to pass the bill as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's second recommendation is that I formally approach my state and territory counterparts about participating in the international transfer of prisoners scheme. Members would be aware that this matter has been on the agenda of the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General for some time. I have previously written to my colleagues from the states and territories on this issue on a number of occasions. I have again recently written and drawn their attention to the committee's report. In accordance with the committee's recommendation I have emphasised the value of the scheme and the need for all states and territories to enact complementary legislation as a matter of priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third recommendation is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock. It is that he initiate an examination of the issues surrounding the eligibility of persons who have been removed from Australia as children to have a right of entry to Australia. The question as to whether certain people should have a right of entry to Australia is clearly a wider issue relating to migration legislation, rather than simply an issue
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3006"> specifically related to the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill. I therefore have written to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs drawing this recommendation to his attention and requesting him to undertake any necessary follow&hyphen;up action. I note that any subsequent action on this issue should not impede the progress of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth recommendation is that my department note any difficulties which arise in the operation of the transfer scheme as a result of either the language used in paragraph 15(1)(a) or its substantive elements, and report on any such difficulties in an annual review of the scheme. That paragraph requires that for transfers to Australia neither the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the transfer country's court or tribunal nor the conviction on which it is based is subject to appeal under the law of the transfer country. This requires that the appeal process is exhausted. It does not, however, exclude the possibility of a later review based, for example, on fresh evidence. I have requested my department to pay particular attention to the practical operation of this paragraph when the scheme is in place and to report on any particular difficulties as part of the annual reporting process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth recommendation is that when the regulations are drafted they should provide that prisoners be given information about either prison conditions in the country they want to transfer to, or relevant organisations that provide such information, prior to the making of the decision about being transferred to that country. I agree with this recommendation and will ensure that this matter is addressed in the drafting of the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sixth recommendation is that the operation of the act be reviewed by the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department annually and that a report of that review be tabled in the parliament. I agree that regular reporting on the operation of the legislation is important. I propose to implement this recommendation by having my department include specific information on the operation of the act in its annual report, which is tabled in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, it is recommended that clause 24 be redrafted for clarification purposes. I agree with this recommendation and have circulated a government amendment in response to it. I commend the bill to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Education Legislation Amendment Bill is not controversial legislation. We support it. There does not seem to be any disagreement coming from any quarter about the desirability of moving the University of Canberra from Commonwealth control to that of the ACT government. I think that makes a great deal of sense. It makes the arrangement more consistent with that applying to almost all the other universities in this country&mdash;the big exception of course being the Australian National University. That university does have a somewhat different function, given that it has within it the Institute of Advanced Studies, which receives a large part of total higher education research funding and which is very much a national asset. So there is some sense in continuing to maintain it as a national institution under the control of the Commonwealth government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly we agree that moving the University of Canberra to the ACT government is a good move. The Vice&hyphen;Chancellor, Professor Aitken, has been very keen to see this matter expedited. I indicated to him that, from the point of view of the opposition, we would do everything possible to speed the process up. So the bill is being treated as non&hyphen;controversial, as indicated by the fact that it is being debated in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the major measure in the legislation. The other change relates to the Maritime College and confers on it a capacity to make statutes in relation to regulating parking and something or other else, which is hardly what you would call contentious. We are inclined to support both those measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of Canberra has really come on very well over the last few years. I know well the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor, Professor Aitken. I particularly knew him well when I was minister for higher education from 1990 to 1993. He is an outstanding institutional leader and has made a major contribution over the years to public debate about educational issues. He has made a major contribution to this country's education system in a variety of capacities over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the University of Canberra itself is showing the benefits of that very good institutional leadership. It is now in a number of areas of study an institution that produces graduates whose employability is among the highest in the country, certainly in particular fields. I think Professor Aitken has a vision for the future of the institution and has been instrumental in pushing it along.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate all those associated with the university and wish it well for the future. I hope that the new relationship established with the ACT government, which certainly the university itself favours, will assist in promoting its further development as an institution servicing this region and the country as a whole.</PARA></SPEECH>

Having a maritime background, I thought there might be something that I could relate to in relation to that particular act, and at the same time indulge myself a little. I remember the setting up of that college with a great deal of fondness. However, I then noticed that the amendment related to the invariable discussion at universities about car parking. That is a bone of contention no matter what  campus you go to, it seems&mdash;although the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) might

The thrust of the Education Legislation Amendment Bill is the amendments to the University of Canberra Act. The clear thrust is to amend the act in order to transfer responsibility for the University of Canberra from the Commonwealth to the ACT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the risk of being labelled a bit of an old fogey, I want to look a little at universities generally in a philosophical way and lament what has happened to them. While I welcome the particular development in one sense, it is timely to cast one's mind back a little to what has happened in relation to universities, particularly in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of them have become businesses. I question whether that is a good thing. In some areas one would say, `Yes, it is good that we can promote the development of research and development.' For example, the areas of research at the University of Queensland have been expanded, and great assistance has been forthcoming, particularly in the engineering and metallurgical areas, where great developments have been made that have spawned a number of significant developments, particularly in metallurgy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, from a philosophical point of view, the overall notion that a university is really a business tends to detract from what universities should engender. I am reminded of the notion of student protest. I find the widespread lack of student protest alarming in many respects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the greatest curses facing mankind is hunger, and yet student protests these days at universities seem to revolve around very selfish issues. They seem to be talking about whether they are getting enough, or more frequently not getting anything, out of the public purse. Great protests are made of that in sectional areas. Frequently, somewhat trendy middle&hyphen;class pursuits and debates are followed&mdash;the sorts of things that permeate cafe society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the leading? Where is the forefront of protest in universities? Where are the students who are standing up for the hungry in society? Why aren't they at the vanguard of those issues? Why aren't we seeing raised the thought-provoking placards of the sort we used to see in the 1960s, draped across the Victoria bridge? And what about the marches?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was at university, I was never a person who would go around protesting. In fact, I was a conservative student, but I did admire the protest movement, because I admired the fact that there were people who were prepared to question the society and to question the Vietnam War and the various establishment norms. The fact that we had those things going on in the university culture in those days was, I think, healthy for society generally. I ask myself, with some regret, where that movement has gone, and whether the university system has in fact crushed dissent, somewhat subconsciously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Has the whole structure of university life become so centred on goals and outcomes that the free thought that universities ought to promote, nurture and respect and the time for those activities and the fun associated with them have really been crushed by the nature of university life? Has the learning been such a drag and such an impost that wisdom, dissent and initiative have been squeezed out of students these days?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3009">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret to say that I feel that that has happened a lot. Largely we see in the protest movement, or what is left of it, somewhat of a Trotskyist rump. I am not saying necessarily that that is a bad thing, either. I do not think it is a bad thing, but the fact is that it is so marginalised that nobody bothers with it anyway, whereas the university protest movement of the old days was a much broader church.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worthy of note that many of the people on both sides of politics were part of that protest movement, in one form or another, and have variously segregated to particular areas of politics; but frequently they joined for part of those protest movements, which was a good thing, and I think it spawned the sort of leadership potential that we see in the political sphere now. Are we going to lose that, if we do not remember that that is the way that university life is conducted? Perhaps I am lamenting the good old days. Are they gone for good&mdash;or bad, depending on one's point of view?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, the University of Canberra began life as the Canberra College of Advanced Education, and it was assisted through the transition to university by sponsorship from Monash University, and that process began in 1989. The sponsorship arrangements gave Monash University powers of approval over the development of the University of Canberra's graduate programs and over staff appointments at certain levels. In 1992 the vice&hyphen;chancellors of both universities agreed that the continuation of sponsorship was unnecessary and it was time to bring the Big Brother type of relationship to an end. The bill makes appropriate and necessary amendments to the University of Canberra Act, to reflect the fact that the sponsorship arrangements no longer apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Monash University is an institution of considerable significance for the government. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) graduated from that university with a BA and a LLB (Hons). After completing his undergraduate studies, he went on to become a tutor in the faculties of law, economics and politics at Monash and was an academic of some renown who, in undergraduate life, was quite intensely involved in the campus scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To return to my original point, for many years the university campus has been the breeding ground for leaders of the future, but the leaders were also found outside the university. It was a nice combination. We think of people like Ben Chifley in that regard, and you see on our side of politics a lot of people who have never been near a university but who have acquired the wisdom from the university of life. While it is still the case today that we are looking for potential leaders from the university culture, I wonder if the emphasis upon academic attainment is so ingrained in university life that it is at the expense of the joie de vivre exhibited by university students in the 1960s and 1970s. I will leave that with the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also introduces amendments to the Remuneration Tribunal Act to give effect to the policy that it is appropriate for higher education institutions in the states and territories to determine for themselves what role, if any, that tribunal should have in relation to determining salaries in those areas. It is worthy to observe also, in this fairly general debate, that one of the most often lamented or criticised matters when I was an undergraduate was the standard of performance of some of the academics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a culture of the business orientated university, which highlights that in my time at university, in the 1970s, there was certainly a need to look at the standard of academics. They seemed frequently to be ungovernable by any standards of performance, output and ability to lecture. The students would complain constantly about performance, yet nothing was ever done. I hope that universities, particularly as a result of this measure,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3010"> recognise that there is a need to ensure standards of academic excellence and that the old catchcry of the independence of academics and their position in the debate is not used as a means of stifling justifiable criticism of some of the performance of academics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One lecturer that I had would not qualify to make tea in the office of a suburban solicitor, yet he was lecturing in a very significant area of law at the University of Queensland&mdash;having been passed on from a Melbourne university, with glowing references. It is those sorts of things I am talking about. I know I am going back some years, but I suspect that it is an area that universities should be looking at. Overall, I thank the Committee for this opportunity to participate in this debate and support the amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I arise also to support the Education Legislation Amendment Bill and, as the member for Canberra, to speak principally about the transfer of the University of Canberra to the ACT government. I will talk in detail, in the brief time available, about some aspects to do with the university, but I want firstly to contrast the positive recognition in this bill of the self&hyphen;government of the ACT, and the rights and capacity of the ACT to discharge this sort of obligation equally with the states, with the dreadful decision that parliament made last night with regard to the Andrews bill, the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My principal concern about that bill was not its reflection on the rights of territories, as I made clear in my speech in the Main Committee. My concern was one of the substance of the matter. But we now have a situation where citizens of the three territories&mdash;if you include Norfolk Island, which is also part of my electorate&mdash;suffer a disease not known to any other Australian, called Andrews agony. They are the only people who have had this parliament impose upon them suffering which they desire to be freed from and from which the parliament which they had elected gave them an outlet. I deplore and regret that decision, and I choose very briefly to make that contrast with the very positive recognition for the ACT reflected in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want only to speak about that part of the bill that relates to the University of Canberra. It is a transfer that was originally proposed by the university, and I think correctly. It was supported by the previous government and it was supported by this government, and reintroduced by it. It had been introduced by the previous government but not finished before the election. It is supported also by the Labor and Liberal parties in the ACT. It is, clearly, not a politically controversial matter, nor institutionally, in terms of the views of the University of Canberra or any of the other principal education institutions of the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of Canberra is a very important institution in ACT society and in the ACT economy. It sees itself as a significant part of the community. It participates actively within the community and makes a substantial contribution to it. I welcome, and was very interested in, some of the remarks made by the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith)&mdash;and I do not pretend that I shared them all&mdash;and I thought he was raising some interesting questions about the nature of universities and their relationship to their staff and students in this time of greater focus on the commercial role of universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested in his perception of the changing role of students in our society, as evidenced by his comment upon the lack of demonstrations&mdash;which was an interesting comment to hear from a member of the government&mdash;and his concern that the universities were becoming too business oriented and were changing their focus from the more academic and research orientation to a more commercial orientation. I was very interested to hear those
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3011"> remarks from a government member and I welcome the fact that he raised those issues. As I say, I do not share all the views he expressed, but I thought they were interesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we want to look at why the volume and nature of public policy involvement by students change, we need to look at more than what is going on in universities; we need to have a look at what is going on much more broadly in the economy and in society. That would be a debate worth having, but it would be a different debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that the University of Canberra does significantly here in the ACT relates to that commercial role in terms of the influx of foreign fee&hyphen;paying students. They are important to the university. In the last year for which I have figures, foreign fee&hyphen;paying students were 9.7 per cent of the university's total student load and contributed $5.41 million in 1995 to the university. They also contribute substantially to the broader economy of the ACT in terms of that $5.41 million and in terms of the other activities of those students while they are here participating at the university, and in terms of people who come to visit the ACT as a result of those students being here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like all universities, the University of Canberra is facing financial difficulties as a result of the government funding changes. It is putting the university under pressure. It is requiring decisions to be made that the administration, the students and the staff do not welcome. I hope that we can see some easing of that relentless pressure upon tertiary institutions in general and, for the purpose of this debate, the University of Canberra in particular, in the forthcoming budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of Canberra makes a substantial broader regional contribution. It says in its mission statement and objectives that the university sets itself to be the principal knowledge resource for the ACT and its hinterland and to possess the strongest possible links between the university and the community. It is very significant in the ACT. It is important that it raises that broader question of its significance in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the causes of concern to me, when people assess the economy of the ACT, is the failure of people to understand the complex and important interrelationship between that economy and the economy of the whole of the south&hyphen;east of New South Wales, most obviously with Queanbeyan but quite importantly with the much broader south&hyphen;eastern New South Wales region of which Canberra operates as the major regional city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a university of national significance. I cannot do justice to that in the time available, but I have been aware of, and in some ways rather involved in, the important work it does at the Australian Centre for Local Government Studies, with the CRCs, with the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling and with the Ngunnawal Centre for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education. So you can see broader national involvement and contribution by the University of Canberra, and that reinforces the extent to which I welcome its role here and this legislation transferring responsibility to the ACT government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I want to make, because I did promise those seeking to organise the agenda that I would finish in 10 minutes, is about the underestimated contribution of universities in regional cities&mdash;not just Canberra, but also in most of Australia's major regional cities&mdash;in the employment area. Directly, with academic staff and non&hyphen;academic staff, plus measuring the full&hyphen;time equivalents of the casual staff in the various categories, there are a thousand jobs at the University of Canberra. Very many other jobs are indirectly contributed to by its existence. The whole high technology park across the road from the university would not exist and thrive in the way it does without its interrelationship with the IT and engineering schools
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3012"> of the university. Some of those functions would be there anyway, some would not, with the CRCs and the other relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome this legislation and the fact that it is going to pass through the parliament in this session. I welcome the fact that it has had bipartisan support, as it had in the past. I look forward to the continuing successful development of the university under the jurisdiction of the ACT government.</PARA></SPEECH>

Anyway, I take the point made by the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) which is obviously right: there is more to life than just money, and there should be more to university life than simply passing exams. I welcome his contribution to this debate on the Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill, as the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) said, is a very uncontroversial one. It transfers responsibility for the University of Canberra from the Commonwealth to the ACT government and it also provides to the Australian Maritime College the ability to make by&hyphen;laws to control its own parking. I should point out that this bill in no way diminishes the Commonwealth's funding obligations to the University of Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has had a rather long march through the legislative process to fruition this evening. It was in April 1993 when the University of Canberra first sought this transfer from Commonwealth to territory jurisdiction, because the university believed that it would be better integrated into the ACT government's education strategies if it came under the ACT's jurisdiction. It believed that, in this way, there would be a closer identification between the university and the ACT. It believed that it would serve the purposes of the university to have as its parliamentary champion, as it were, the ACT minister for education, rather than the federal minister who had many other things on his or her plate. I guess the university thought that it was perhaps better to be a big fish in a small pool, than a small fish in a big pool. Legislation was finally brought into the parliament in late 1995 by the former government, but it lapsed as a result of the election, so this legislation is now before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is a sign of the government's commitment to the ACT. It is a sign of successful lobbying on the part of Professor Aitken, Senator Margaret Reid and many other people. From the government's point of view, placing the University of Canberra under territory jurisdiction puts it in the same position as nearly all other universities, with the exception of the Australian National University.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These universities are juridically responsible to state and territory governments, even though the Commonwealth provides the vast preponderance of funds. I am sure the ACT government is appropriately grateful for this chance to exercise stewardship over the University of Canberra while the Commonwealth continues to provide the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the second aspect of this bill, in late 1993 the Australian Maritime College in Launceston was troubled by a very serious problem. It seems that the adjacent University of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3013"> Tasmania campus introduced parking restrictions on its students and, as a result, some of those students chose to park in the grounds of the Australian Maritime College.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Maritime College then sought legal advice on its ability to control parking on its own grounds. I am going to read, if I may, some of that advice, because it is important that everyone understands exactly why the government is taking up the parliament's time with this legislation. When the AMC asked the lawyers for advice, it posed this question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does the College have power to make traffic regulations that are enforceable?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The lawyers answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We note the provisions of Section 24 of the Maritime College Act 1978 which allows the Council to make statutes . . . with respect to the . . . (a) management, good government and discipline of the College and of the institution conducted by the College.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It further allows . . . for the imposition, by or on behalf of the College, of penalties upon students of the College or persons employed by the College for contravention of, or failure to comply with, a statute with respect to a matter referred to in paragraph (a).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, the lawyers went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not contemplate, by inference, penalties upon "outsiders" such as trespassing students from the University or any other people illegally parked upon College property.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The lawyers then advised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If one turns to Section 24(1)(j) which provides that statutes may be enacted for "any other matter necessary or convenient for giving effect to this Act" then one can see that it was obviously the intent of Parliament to provide general powers to the College to govern its own affairs. Its own affairs must, by definition, include the management of its grounds. Nevertheless we are concerned that some legal challenge could, conceivably, be mounted to any parking scheme by reason of the unfortunate wording of Section 24(1)(b) which refers to penalties being imposed only upon students or staff. As a matter of practicality it might be highly unlikely that the scheme would be challenged but nevertheless we feel obliged to point out the possibility.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what the lawyers said, and that is why this act has come before the parliament. The Australian Maritime College can use an action in trespass against anyone parking improperly on the grounds, but it is always much easier to impose a fine&mdash;and hence this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, as the good Lord says, not a sparrow falls without the knowledge of the Father, I am sure the voters of Australia will be delighted to know that not a car is illicitly parked in the grounds of the AMC in Launceston without the benevolent intervention of the federal government. I commend this important bill to the parliament.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996 contains three changes which were announced by the previous government in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget as a response to a small number of recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. The bill also includes consequential changes to child support legislation to reflect changes made in the Social Security Act 1991, the Family Law Act 1975 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The package of measures included in the bill is aimed at increasing flexibility, reducing the level of intrusiveness and improving certainty and clarity in the law.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Use of election where income has changed</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where a child support liability has been created by an administrative assessment, a parent is able to apply to have the registrar vary the amount of their liability by lodging an income estimate election. An income estimate election often results in a paying parent being entitled to a refund of moneys already paid to the person receiving child support. This causes significant inconvenience for persons receiving child support where the amount of child support has already been spent for the benefit of the children. It also means that the parent paying child support often has to repay most, if not all, of the amount refunded over the remainder of the year at a time when they have less capacity to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will amend the effect of an income estimate election to make it less likely that a person receiving child support will be asked to repay amounts in the future and to make the effect of an income estimate election a more accurate reflection of a paying parent's capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The revised income estimate will be used to recalculate the amount of the child support properly payable for the year. However, amounts payable prior to the date of lodgment of an estimate will generally be left undisturbed and will be taken into account in arriving at the future liabilities for the remaining period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only time that amounts payable prior to the lodgment of an estimate will be disturbed is where, after calculating the amount properly payable and the amounts charged to the date of the estimate, the parent has already been charged too much for the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will remove a significant and frequent cause for complaint from persons receiving child support.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Electing for employer withholding not to apply</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to allow a payer of child support to make payments directly to the Child Support Registrar where the registrar is satisfied that a person will make timely payments. This measure will :</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reduce the level of intrusiveness of the child support scheme for payers who can be relied upon to make their child support payments directly to the registrar in a timely manner;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provide greater flexibility to the registrar in the way he administers the collection of child support and reduce overall administration costs; and</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the registrar refuses to accept an election to pay directly, the payer has the right to object to, and appeal against, this decision.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3015">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is conscious that the implications may be severe for children where a payer defaults. The registrar's primary responsibility will continue to be to ensure the collection of child support in a timely manner. In making the proposed change, the government will ensure that there are strict safeguards in the event of default.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the event of default, the registrar will be able to require that child support be withheld from a person's employer in the future and a payer will not be able to make another election until a period of 6 months has elapsed from the date the registrar was required to make arrangements with a person's employer. In most cases, payers who default after choosing to pay directly to the registrar will have strictly limited future access to this provision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Consideration of child support liabilities in property and spousal maintenance proceedings</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will amend the Family Law Act to enable the court to take into account the child support liability of a person in property and spousal maintenance proceedings, even where a child support assessment has not been issued. Under the existing law, where a person is voluntarily paying child support without an assessment of his child support liability, the amounts paid or to be paid under such arrangements cannot be taken into account by the court in making orders in either property or spousal maintenance proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This may result in courts making orders which do not adequately reflect the true circumstances of the party who is to pay child support. This also means that parties must apply for an assessment even where they wish to make private arrangements regarding child support for the court to take into account these commitments when making orders regarding property or spousal maintenance. This will ensure that separated parents with private arrangements for child support will be treated in the same way as parents who are paying child support under the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Employer record keeping requirements</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to reduce the period an employer is required to retain child support records from seven years to five years. This will bring the child support requirement into line with record keeping requirements under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will make it easier for employers to voluntarily comply with their record keeping obligations by having one period for both taxation and child support purposes. It will also result in a slight reduction in the cost of compliance as the period of retention of records for child support purposes has been reduced.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Family Law Act 1975 changes</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I expect that amendment moved by the opposition to be embraced by the government members, particularly their self&hyphen;appointed experts on the back bench who have stood up on numerous occasions lamenting the shortcomings of the child support scheme. I anticipate the support of the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), the member for Bowman (Mrs West), the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), the member for Longman (Mr Brough) and the member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly)&mdash;just to name a few. This has been one of the interesting features of the new government backbench since the last election: their determination to talk big on the question of child support reform but to act very little when it comes to bringing to the parliament substantive amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, of course, unacceptable that the government after 12 months in office has failed to respond to the findings and recommendations of the parliamentary report of 1994. The measures now before the parliament represent an ALP response from the time of the 1995&hyphen;96 budget. So, for a government that promised so much and for a government backbench which has spoken so frequently on this matter, one would expect the Howard government to do a lot more than to imitate the Labor proposals that were foreshadowed at the time of the 1995 budget. Once again the Labor Party is in a position where it is here to help the government honour its election commitments to improve the operation, effectiveness and equity of the Child Support Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to introduce certain recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, reflecting the changes announced by the former government in August 1995. A major impact of the package is that it streamlines a number of administrative elements of the child support scheme, foreshadowing three changes to existing arrangements: firstly, the use of election where income is changed; secondly, electing for employer withholding not to apply; and, finally, consideration of child support liabilities in family law proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will deal with the first of these reforms. Parents have the right to apply to the Child Support Registrar to vary the amount of their liability so that either the custodial parent is forced to repay moneys which have already been spent on the supported children in question, or, conversely, that a paying parent is forced to repay most or all of the amount refunded over the remainder of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current system, variation to a paying parent's liability has been extremely inconvenient for both the custodial and non&hyphen;custodial parent. The purpose of this aspect of the amendment is to allow for a more accurate reflection of the payer's future capacity to pay
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3017"> because the amount payable will only be charged for the months remaining after the estimate  has been lodged. It will also reduce the likelihood of a custodial parent being compelled to make repayments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reform is electing for employer withholding not to apply. An amendment to the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 will give payers the opportunity to make payments direct to the Child Support Registrar. The only caveat to this is that the registrar be satisfied that the person will make timely payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of this change include a saving in administrative costs which would have otherwise been spent in an attempt to make the employers aware of the scheme's operation and their subsequent responsibilities. It also provides a greater choice of method of payment for the non&hyphen;custodial parent. Many payers opt to make payments directly to the registrar rather than through an employer link, which has the advantages of privacy and confidentiality. Essentially, this change reflects greater discretion in the way the collection of child support is administered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the final reform, presently any voluntary child support arrangement is not taken into account by the Family Court in either property or spouse maintenance proceedings. The bill will have the effect of putting these arrangements in the same way as a child support assessment and will thus allow the court to more accurately assess the financial circumstances of the parties to the proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) mentioned, the bill also contains three areas of consequential amendments to related acts. In respect to the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988, this is an administrative change to bring child support record keeping requirements by employers in line with the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The period for which employers must retain child support records will be reduced from seven to five years. The administrative burden on employers in relation to their child support responsibilities will be reduced, and a system of uniform record keeping established between these acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Family Law Act 1995 is amended so that the definition of parentage is streamlined by the amendment to bring it in line with the current family law provisions. These incidental amendments cover the definition of a prescribed court, the replacement of parentage in terms of months with a measure of weeks, and the presumptions which arise from cohabitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 is being amended to ensure that certain provisions in the act with reference to the Social Security Act 1947 are updated with the provisions of the Social Security Act 1991. One feature of the amendment is that it focuses on the paying parent and examines their rights, rather than solely those of the custodial parent. The rationale is to make it easier for the custodial parent to comply with his or her recognised responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the use of election where income has changed, the existing regime has proved to be a real burden for certain types of workers&mdash;for example, seasonal workers who are asked to estimate their income for a financial year. At least under this new provision, income estimates provided by such payers will provide a better reflection of their actual capacity to pay. This rationale also applies to consideration of child support liabilities and family law proceedings, allowing for more accurate initial assessment of the financial circumstances of the custodial and non&hyphen;custodial parent.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In tabling the committee's report, my colleague the member for Chifley, Mr Price, spoke of the need for the Child Support Agency to become a client focused and client sensitive organisation. The report contained over 160 recommendations, which were described as a fine blueprint for reform, designed to chart the way ahead for the child support scheme. Although this was a lengthy process, gradually many of the recommendations in some shape or form have been finding their way into the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation&mdash;the Labor response to the select committee&mdash;is the final instalment on the recommendations. I believe it is appropriate for the Main Committee and the parliament to acknowledge their appreciation for the work of the joint select committee, particularly the chairperson, Mr Price. It is not an easy area of public policy administration and consideration, but they produced a fine report that has deserved a lot better since the election than the passage of 12 months without any active response to the remaining recommendations by the new federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The submissions received by the committee raised several concerns about specific aspects of the child support formula. The areas of the formula which generated the most concern included the non&hyphen;custodial parent's self&hyphen;support component, the custodial parent's disregarded income level and the maximum income base against which the child support formula is applied. The joint committee report was an important analysis of a very complex government program. The opposition's call, through the amendment I moved earlier, for legislation to amend the child support assessment formula within the next six months follows considerable debate on this complex issue. No member could doubt the significance of the bill before us, but it is disappointing indeed, for the opposition and for tens of thousands of families subject to the child support scheme, that some of the recommendations in the report have still not been addressed at this stage. As the Department of Social Security pointed out in its submission to the child support inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no absolutes in relation to child support. Rather the issue is the balance points between separated and intact families; between children of first and subsequent families; between custodial and non&hyphen;custodial parents; and between parents and taxpayers generally. These balance points are complex and, in both social and economic terms, are affected by the interactions of the taxation, social security and child support systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inquiry provides the opportunity to re&hyphen;test the balance points and to clear the air on certain issues which have emerged.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With many other members of parliament, I have encountered numerous cases of the `balance points' the department refers to, through the work that I have undertaken with constituents in my electorate office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate that any changes to the formula will change the balance between the interests of custodial and non&hyphen;custodial parents and taxpayers. There are very few instances, particularly when it comes to consideration of the formula, where policy makers can examine win&hyphen;win scenarios. This is an area of policy, in the absence of major injections of public funding, where most of the reforms throw up the prospect of win&hyphen;lose scenarios. So the application of sound policy principles is all important. I can foreshadow that, as the opposition member now
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3019"> chartered with some shadow responsibilities for child support, I will be trying to apply some fresh principles to this complex area of public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is so often the case with these win&hyphen;lose scenarios, the child support area has been seen through the prism of gender equity issues. I am disappointed that so many of these debates seem to have fallen to the level of pitching male versus female interests. It is much healthier for the parliament and parliamentarians to consider child support through the prism of income equity concerns and to examine the fairness of the existing income transfers implicit in the formula. We should blindfold ourselves to whether the parent is male or female, and rather take an income equity focus on these questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward&mdash;although I know some members would not do so&mdash;to playing an active role in the child support area. It is complex. There are no easy answers. But I believe that by applying some fresh principles of social justice and income equity to these questions, and by blindfolding ourselves to the gender equity concerns, the parliament can have a far healthier and productive debate than we have had to this point in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that changes to the formula are contentious. But my assessment is that the joint select committee report raised all the issues in a very fair fashion and came up with workable recommendations in that respect. In my own electorate of Werriwa there are approximately 6,000 registered non&hyphen;custodial parents who are paying child support for their children. From my discussions and correspondence with many of these parents, I can assure the Main Committee that they are waiting anxiously for the promised reform of the Child Support Agency to become law and, indeed, administrative practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now commonly accepted that change is needed to the child support scheme. The real issue is the degree of change. I say to honourable members that we cannot afford to be complacent about the recommendations of the joint committee in this regard. The package of some 160 recommendations aims to strengthen the scheme, not weaken it. At the last federal election, the coalition's policy was meant to outline their position in relation to child support matters. However, apart from identifying the joint committee's report, the six&hyphen;page document released by the coalition had very little to offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I am moving the amendment standing in my name, and the reason the opposition is confident that government members, if they match their rhetoric, will have no problem with it, is found in the coalition's Child Support Agency election platform. On the front page of the policy the coalition described the findings of the joint committee as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a solid basis for ongoing reform of the Agency.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If that is the case, if the recommendations are such a solid basis for ongoing reform of the agency, why hasn't the government responded to them 12 months after the last election? Their policy document went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will fully address the concerns of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">After the passage of one year, any reasonable person would have to conclude that that could not have been a core promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must have been a non&hyphen;core promise because the government has not addressed any of the concerns of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law issues. It has ducked for cover. It has failed to fulfil the high expectations it set in so many electorates&mdash;particularly those along the coastal strip of Queensland and especially in the mining towns&mdash;that it would act
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3020"> on the findings of the joint committee. It is regrettable that the government has been so tardy in this particular process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also take up the words of the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who was then the shadow minister for social security. Before the last election, in a media release issued on 22 February 1996, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Coalition Government will reform the Child Support Agency and the Child Support Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He stated that the priorities for the coalition in office would be to ensure that the child support formula was made equitable to, as he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . offer a better deal for custodial and non&hyphen;custodial parents alike.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I make the point again: after the passage of 12 months in office, the new government has not made any change, or proposed any changes, to the child support formula. That statement was made some 13 months ago and not a single change has yet been introduced by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there has been not only a failure to match the high expectations before the election, but also a failure to match up to the rhetoric since the election. You only had to turn on the radio through the New Year&hyphen;January period to know that the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) in particular was boasting on the airwaves about the sort of support and momentum he was supposedly generating within the government for major changes to the child support formula. Whatever happened to that big talk? Whatever happened to that momentum? He produced a survey and was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 2 January this year as saying that he had assessed the views of 60 coalition backbenchers and that 95 per cent of them wanted the Child Support Agency laws and formula changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's second reading amendment calls for change. After more than 12 months, it is time to transform the necessary changes and the high rhetoric of people such as the member for Herbert into the law of the Commonwealth. I look forward to the support of the 60 coalition backbenchers who say they want change and to them actually voting for change by supporting the opposition amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these matters I suppose the government might be reaching for excuses. One of them might be that its chosen minister, initially, for looking after the child support area was Senator Short. He hit the wall on other matters&mdash;not child support but financial support for himself, and his declaration of it to the parliament. I sent him many pieces of correspondence from my electorate, from people concerned about the administration of child support, but among the scores of letters that I had sent on to his office by the time of his fall I received only one back. It is worth quoting. It is the Jim Short memorial letter on child support matters, which he might care to take with him on his way to an overseas job for the boy. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since becoming responsible for child support administration, many of you have told me of the need to improve the Child Support Agency's operations. Many electorate offices deal regularly with client complaints on issues which we expect could have been resolved by a simple phone call to the CSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am keen to address the problems that many clients are facing with the CSA and, through this, to reducing the number of CSA complaints which are being handled by staff in electorate offices and by Members and Senators themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition Government's policy on child support commits us to administrative reform of the CSA and to addressing the concerns of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Short did not deliver. All he could promise, effectively, was the resolution of these matters by a phone call&mdash;as he put it, a simple phone call. It takes more than that. It takes a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3021"> bill, draft legislation, consideration by the parliament and acting on the findings of the joint committee report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, Jim Short's fascination with shares and pecuniary interests meant that he was not around long enough to put his rhetoric into action. The belief of the previous minister that the child support complaints brought to the attention of electorate offices can be resolved by `one simple phone call' illustrates the severe short&hyphen;sightedness of this government. I do not know of any aggrieved client of the Child Support Agency who believes their problems can be resolved by a phone call alone. Indeed, the joint committee's report highlighted the inadequacies of the communication channels that exist between staff and clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After more than 12 months in office this government has failed to take any steps to honour its election commitment to implement the recommendations of the joint select committee's report. This is the opportunity for those government backbenchers who have been vocal in bringing to the attention of the House specific cases of the system's failings to do more than just talk about it. Let me quote from some of the rhetoric that we have heard in recent times. I know I am supported in the amendment that I have moved by the member for Capricornia, or at least supported in his media release of 12 September 1996, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the meeting&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">with the Lone Fathers Association, in the town of Rockhampton&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Marek said he is keen to see the issues raised by the Lone Fathers' Association addressed by the Government as quickly as possible and will continue to make representations in the matter until they are properly resolved.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was some six to seven months ago and still there is no action. Item (5) of the opposition's amendment today is very kind to the member for Capricornia and his colleagues. We are giving him and the government six more months in which to legislate on changes to the child support formula. It is in their hands and, indeed, the hands of the entire coalition backbench to vote for our amendment and bind the government to change the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having discussed some specific areas of reform, I want to mention the need to strengthen the CSA's administration, to allow it to better serve its clients through effective communication. These communication problems spark the need for a child support clients charter to improve service delivery. This was an initiative of the previous Labor government. In January 1996 George Gear, as Assistant Treasurer, introduced the charter designed to improve the working relationship between clients and the CSA by setting out in plain English what parents can expect and their responsibilities in ensuring a future for the children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Specifically, the charter identifies the responsibility of those CSA clients and staff on issues such as codes of conduct, service standards, compensation, and a dispute resolution and review mechanism. The charter complemented an earlier $50 million boost to CSA resources, targeted at all agency offices in an attempt to allocate more staff to phones and upgraded communications technology within the agency. Better communications require complementary resources, especially staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Documents obtained by the federal opposition showed, in October last year, that the government is actually closing suburban Sydney CSA offices, abandoning thousands of clients outside the Sydney CBD. The hardest hit areas will be west and south&hyphen;west Sydney, where the Penrith, Bankstown and Hurstville offices will in the next few years be closed, losing somewhere in the vicinity of 250 jobs. The Bankstown office caters for my electorate, as it would, I expect, for the electorate of the member of Fowler (Mr Ted Grace), and I shudder to think that in a few years time constituents from Campbelltown and Liverpool will be forced
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3022"> to travel to the city if they need to see a CSA review officer. This will be over an hour of travel by public transport each way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following its extensive inquiry, the joint committee came to the conclusion that the current self-support component which applies to the non-custodial parent with no subsequent family, equivalent to the single pension rate, is set at too low a level. By quoting the self-support components of the single pension rate, the child support formula fails to truly reflect the additional costs of employment which are carried out by employed non-custodial parents and the additional fringe benefits available to pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, recommendation 123 of the joint committee report suggests that the self-support component, referred to as the excluded income amount in the amendments, be increased. It argued that such a change would go a long way to achieving the best resolution of the balance points referred to earlier. The parents I speak to commonly cite the frustration which is felt with regard to the self-support component of the formula. The sooner we act on this frustration the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I receive scores of letters from frustrated parents from all over the country who are disillusioned with the government's and, in particular, with the Assistant Treasurer's unwillingness to act on their concern after all the election promises for reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only public comments that have been attributed to ministers was a matter that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> on 13 February this year. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social Security Minister Jocelyn Newman and Assistant Treasurer Rod Kemp are understood to be examining initial proposals but are concerned at possible budgetary effects.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This confirms again that the government is treating child support as a non-core promise. We all know that if the government is shying away because of possible budgetary effects, because of their slash and burn approach to fiscal policy, those citizens right around Australia concerned about the workings of the Child Support Agency should not hold their breath expecting this government to produce positive legislative changes to the formula.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's second reading amendment has the potential to make a difference to the lives of almost a million Australians who are affected by the child support scheme. The agency's caseload has grown from just 58 cases in 1988 to cover 360,000 cases today, the equivalent of 720,000 clients. It is projected that this caseload will increase by an average of 5,000 cases a month. In addition to this workload, the CSA receives an estimated 11,000 telephone calls and in excess of 4,000 letters a day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are staggering figures by any account and the problems that have arisen largely because of the CSA's rate of growth have exceeded all expectations. That confirms beyond all doubt that this is, if I can use the term, a mainstream issue and concern to the Australian people. It is not something that should necessarily be sent away to the Main Committee alone. I look forward to the House voting on my second reading amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that level of caseload, with 720,000 clients and growing by 5,000 cases a month, this is an issue that every single member of this parliament must address. Every single member must be urging the minister responsible, Senator Kemp, to act on the findings of the joint committee and to bring a much fairer system of child support to all those citizens around Australia who rely on this parliament for a much fairer deal.</PARA>
