<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that all members of the House will be particularly concerned about the very disturbing events in Papua New Guinea over the last 48 hours. Since becoming independent, Papua New Guinea has adhered&mdash;often in very difficult circumstances&mdash;to strong democratic principles and has acted in accordance with the provisions of its constitution. A central element of that democratic tradition has of course been the absolute authority of the civilian government over military authorities. I should, therefore, make it very clear on behalf of the government&mdash;and I believe on behalf of every member of this House&mdash;that we utterly deplore the attempts of the former Commander-in-Chief of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force to defy the authority of the duly elected government of Papua New Guinea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the circumstances, the action taken by the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Julius Chan, to remove the head of the defence force was both understandable and justifiable. I certainly express the hope, on behalf of the government, that there will be a proper, peaceful and normal return to the constitutional processes of that country. Our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> position on this subject was made crystal clear in public comments yesterday and our High Commission in Port Moresby has conveyed our position to the Papua New Guinea government and is also conveying our attitude to the current acting commander of the defence forces in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not an occasion for overblown rhetoric or unduly bellicose statements. The domestic situation in Papua New Guinea is fragile. The government there does have a very difficult domestic problem in relation to Bougainville. My government and the government led by my predecessor as Prime Minister grappled with that issue over a period of time. There is no easy solution and anybody who understands circumstances in New Guinea will know how difficult it is for any government of that country to resolve that particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that and having fully expressed the view that the civilian authority of the elected government of New Guinea should prevail over any statements of the defence force, can I make it clear so far as the other issue in our relationship with Papua New Guinea is concerned&mdash;that is, the potential use of mercenaries on Bougainville&mdash;that the attitude of the Australian government that that would be a retrograde and an extremely regrettable step remains completely as it was before the events of the last 48 hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members will know, I met the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Julius Chan, in Sydney last Sunday week. During a discussion of some 4&half; hours, which traversed the full gamut of the bilateral relationship, I made it very clear to him that Australia remained very strongly opposed to the use of mercenaries on Bougainville and that, if the use of those mercenaries took place, there would be consequences of a serious kind so far as the relationship between Australia and New Guinea was concerned. I take this opportunity of reiterating that position on behalf of the government. I make it plain that the alternatives to the use of the mercenaries, which I outlined to the Prime Minister on 9 March, remain on the table and I draw the Prime Minister's attention to the existence of those alternatives.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2264">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I want to make is that the primary concern of the government at present is the safety of Australian citizens in Papua New Guinea. That is a situation which has remained under very close attention over past weeks, particularly over the last 48 hours, and, as would be expected, the government is very closely monitoring that situation. All appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that if there is any threat to those people&mdash;and I am not advised that there is any threat of consequence at present&mdash;every available opportunity will be taken to continue monitoring and, if steps are necessary, they will be taken.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition agrees basically with the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), including in particular the strictures that he made on the question of the authority of civilian rule over military predilections at any point in time in Papua New Guinea and also the questions he raised in relation to the difficulties that are being confronted by the Papua New Guinean government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note and appreciate the fact that he made reference to concerns on his part that, should a situation which does not now exist occur at some point in time in the future where more concern might be exercised in relation to the presence of some 10,000 Australian nationals who live and work in Papua New Guinea, he is bearing their concerns and the question of their safety in mind. That is important, particularly in the context in which we are making statements to the Papua New Guinean government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also recognise that there are occasionally situations in international diplomatic circles when governments can make statements behind doors, not publicly, but oppositions are not in that same position. So let me make a few. I think it has to be made absolutely clear to the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea that we regard the persistent attitude on his part to the continued or the possible use of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mercenaries in Bougainville to be completely unacceptable and as drawing consequences in terms of the relationship between Papua New Guinea and Australia should that situation obtain. Those consequences would go to the defence cooperation program and to the aid budget. He should be placed clearly on notice that we have those concerns and that those concerns will produce those consequences if that is persisted with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not simply a question, important though it is, of the use of mercenaries in that situation in Bougainville, nor is it simply a question of Sandline International. There are other mercenary groups operating around the globe as well as them. The question of how they are utilised on Bougainville is of concern to us, but the introduction of mercenary forces into the political and military equation in South Pacific island states would be absolutely devastating, not simply in Papua New Guinea but elsewhere through the South Pacific. A line is being, and ought to be, firmly drawn by the Australian government in relation to the Papua New Guinean government as far as that is concerned, not only because of the issue on Bougainville but because of the general concerns that prevail in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a bit of gratuitous commentary from Sir Julius Chan on the attitudes of the Australian government since the Australian government has made its views clear. The Australian government has every reason to believe that Julius's nose has been thumbed at it from the outset on this particular occasion, starting with the foreign minister's appearance in announcing a $4 million aid package for what was then apparently Papua New Guinean government strategy some four days before the hiring of Sandline became evident and followed by an appearance that guarantees were being given that mercenaries would not be serving on Bougainville and then some days later a firm statement was made by the Papua New Guinean government that in fact that was not the case and they would still continue to be used there. Quite clearly there is an erratic response forthcoming from the Papua New Guinean government to the positions that have been put 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2265"> forward to it and apparently undertakings given to us by the Papua New Guinean government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> a particularly gratuitous piece of commentary from the Papua New Guinean government, if it is an accurate reflection of the press conference of the Prime Minister yesterday, and that was a suggestion, evidently in a question, that somewhere or other the reaction or activity of the Papua New Guinean defence forces was related to a threat that was issued by the Australian government that aid issues, military and civilian, were on the table and whether or not that might have motivated the general then in charge of the Papua New Guinean defence forces to do what he did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would have expected, I think, from the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea that there would be a firm rejection of any such suggestion. There was not. In fact, what he had to say was `probably' there was a relationship between the two. Again, that is not an acceptable suggestion, I would have thought, as far as the direction of policy of this country was concerned in our relationship with Papua New Guinea. We have always made it absolutely clear cut in our relationship with the Papua New Guinean defence forces over the years that we see no political role for them whatsoever when these issues from time to time have arisen. They have never arisen as dramatically as they have in the last couple of days, but whenever they have arisen in the past that has been absolutely clear cut on our part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this is a situation which is going to continue for some considerable time and is going to require very considerable diplomatic resources for the Australian government to deal with it. The Australian government will have the backing of the opposition in any stand of absolute firmness as far as this is concerned. We absolutely believe that there is something of a threshold being reached here in a number of issues, and that threshold having been reached we must be absolutely certain that it is not crossed or advanced upon in a way that in the long term both Papua New Guinea and ourselves find it very difficult to live with.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the lines that are being pursued by the Australian government are correct. I cannot see, of course, the way in which their diplomacy in relation to it is being pursued. All I can say is that, to this point of time, the way in which we have pursued it does not necessarily seem to have had very much effect. That means that I do believe that the bunsen burner needs to be turned up a little in relation to the relationship with Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say too&mdash;and this absolutely in no way whatever excuses the actions by the brigadier yesterday&mdash;that part of this mess is a product of the insufficient support given to the Papua New Guinean defence forces by the Papua New Guinean government over a period of time. Really that is a situation which could have been very easily addressed by the $38 million that went to Sandline. There are many issues around that $38 million where legitimate questions are being asked of the Papua New Guinean government and ought to be answered.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not quite up to the standards of the Leader of the Opposition, I did not think. The government did not have any forewarning of the actions by the commander of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force or soon to be former commander of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. Clearly, since the announcement by the Papua New Guinea government or, should I say, the revelation in the media that the Papua New Guinea government was to employ Sandline International, there has been no doubt some debate within the Papua New Guinea military about the wisdom or otherwise of that. I do not really propose to go into a commentary on that. The chief of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force has made his own statements about the attitude of his defence force and that is really a matter for Papua New Guinea to debate and a matter for them to contemplate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to take the opportunity to make it clear that we did have no prior knowledge of the actions and the statements of the commander of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force before yesterday. Since becoming aware of those developments, Australia's views on these matters have been made clear in the Prime Minister's statement today, as well as in the comments that were issued through a spokesman yesterday. The government clearly firmly opposes any unconstitutional moves against the Papua New Guinea government. The government would like to see the Papua New Guinea government resolve this matter as soon as possible, peacefully and in accordance with Papua New Guinea's constitution.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his questions and note his interest and support in matters relating to health financing. I did see that article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> . It quotes a junior doctor representative talking about the IRC hearing yesterday:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Justice Maidment made clear at the [commission] hearing that the negotiations were to be about the substance of the legislation, not only the implementation . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One of my departmental officers was at that meeting yesterday. I have checked with him and he informs me that that comment is completely false, that Justice Maidment made no comments whatsoever about the legislation. And that would stand to reason, given that the federal government is not a party to the industrial dispute. It is a dispute that has been notified by the New South Wales Department of Health. That said, I am happy to meet with representatives of young doctors in New South Wales now that they have decided to resume work, and this will be my eighth meeting in six months with young doctors on this issue specifically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why we are doing this is quite simple. It is because we believe that access to a Medicare provider number involves a degree of mutual obligation&mdash;that, if medical practitioners are to be given access to Medicare for life, they in return have a responsibility to ensure that the quality in general practice is as high as possible and that we can do something to get more doctors into rural areas. Both of these are important; both of them the government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2267"> makes no apology for; on both of them the government has no intention of backing down. It may be that, with respect to the implementation of this, there are a few issues on which I can put young doctors' minds to rest. I am happy to try to do that, but I make it very clear that we do not give in to thuggery, we do not give in to bullying&mdash;and the legislation has passed the parliament. Industrial action in itself is rather strange. It is a bit like two football teams having a match. One football team wins, it leaves the field and the crowd goes home. The other team keeps playing, keeps kicking goals and keeps cheering themselves. The fact is this legislation passed the parliament on 14 December. It received royal assent on 17 December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand the concerns of the younger doctors, though, because there have been some very wild claims relating to this legislation. These were also repeated in the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> today. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The junior doctors have consistently objected to the new legislation, claiming it would cut doctor numbers because of a shortfall of 400 training places a year, leaving many junior doctors without jobs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are claims that have been made since September last year. These are claims that are demonstrably false. The fact is that we are already into the first year of the legislation where we are supposed to have 400 to 500 doctors without access to training positions, and the fact is there are training positions available in Australia that we cannot fill. The last time I checked, which was 1&half; weeks ago, there were 22 training positions in New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory that someone could walk into tomorrow that are unable to be filled. So, far from being 400 to 500 doctors who do not have access to training, there is no doctor who wants training and is prepared to move that does not have access to it and there are, in fact, training positions that are unfilled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, what is being asked for is a guaranteed income for life. We do not give that to hairdressers, we do not give it to accountants, we do not give it to builders&mdash;we do not give it to anyone else in the community&mdash;and it is unreasonable to expect young doctors to be treated by the govern

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. He, along with a number of other members of this House, has taken a deep and abiding interest in the issue of aircraft noise in Sydney. As Chairman of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, he has had a leading role in trying to resolve some of the problems that this government inherited when we came into office in March of last year&mdash;problems which were created by the ineptness and mismanagement of the previous Labor government that left Sydneysiders with an enormous problem dealing with aircraft noise which this government, with the assistance of the honourable member for North Sydney, has been working very hard indeed to try to resolve. I would like to thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his efforts, and indeed the other members of the Sydney Airport Community Forum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue that the honourable member for North Sydney refers to is one that has caused some considerable interest in recent days. When the new third runway was originally constructed, for reasons best known to the former Minister for Transport, the threshold, which is the point at which aircraft land on the runway, was not placed at the end of the runway but was moved some 500 metres in from the end of the runway. This meant that the operations of the airport were unbalanced and this decreased the efficiency of the operation of the airport which caused an increase in delays and in inconvenience for those people who use the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Federal Airports Corporation, as part of its plans to resolve the problems of Sydney airport, has looked at moving the threshold back to where it ought to have been, which is towards the end of the new runway. I have, though, been approached by the member for North Sydney, in his capacity as chairman of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, and he has said to me that members of the Sydney Airport Community Forum have resolved that the threshold issue should not be dealt with at the present time and that the threshold should not be looked at unless it is looked at in light of the long&hyphen;term operating plans for the operation of Sydney airport which the government is currently dealing with.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of our desire to be as aware and sensitive as possible to the needs of Sydneysiders over aircraft noise problems, the government has spoken with the Federal Airports Corporation, and the Federal Airports Corporation has agreed that they will not be moving the threshold at the present time and that any decision to move that threshold will not be made unless it is made in the context of the long&hyphen;term operating plan for Sydney's Mascot airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I compare this with the manner in which the previous government handled this whole issue of aircraft noise. Here we have a clear example of this government listening to the needs of the people in Sydney&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there is any suggestion of sleazy deals in all of this, one can consider that the people of Sydney were treated in a very sleazy fashion by the former government over the way Sydney's aircraft noise problem was created. Indeed, the sleaziness of that arrangement was that nobody in the former Labor government listened to the needs of Sydneysiders, which resulted in mass demonstrations at Sydney airport which caused great inconvenience to all people concerned, inconvenience and delays which could have been resolved by a government which was prepared to listen to the people of Sydney on this vital issue of aircraft noise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are listening to the people of Sydney. This is but one example of that. There are many others. We had, for example, six public meetings held in October and November last year which the honourable member for North Sydney chaired and which thousands of people attended to discuss the long&hyphen;term operating plans for Sydney airport. That is part of the community consultative process that this government is engaging in. We have invited submissions on this subject and, in putting together the long&hyphen;term operating plan for Sydney airport, we received 1,500 submissions from the community which we have taken into account.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think a lot of people, including all of those young people who support the work for the dole scheme, would be very interested to know where the Australian Labor Party stands.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ever since I announced this proposal several weeks ago the Labor Party has been performing a monumental flip-flop on it. One minute it is in favour of it. One minute it is against it. The next minute it is in the middle, then it is slightly on the right, then it is slightly on the left. You had the Leader of the Opposition calling it `a council of despair and failure'. The member for Batman, the spokesman on employment matters, who specialises in making insulting remarks about  young unemployed people, inferring that they stay

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The panels will have an advisory role in assessing decisions made by the Classification Board of the Office of Film and Literature Classification.

Do you also recollect on the subject of statesmanlike treatment of the tariff issue your own newsletter which said, `Lower tariffs in Australia should be matched by equally fair treatment from other countries,' and that, `Lower tariffs should be matched by reductions in business costs,' et cetera?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Adelaide for her question. I appreciate her interest in industrial relations reform. I have seen these remarks. I think they are quite significant. They are the remarks of the shadow minister for industrial relations, who said in Adelaide on 8 March:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a contrast between saying enterprise bargaining is an important option and moving to the point that the only way in which living standards can even be maintained for most Australian workers is through continuing rounds of enterprise bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think it is an important statement, and it was declared an important statement by the shadow minister himself, who said that it was a very big change in Labor's approach to industrial relations. You know it is very big and important in the Labor Party because Jennie George endorsed the statement the next morning on television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose the nub of it is that the opposition's longstanding policy position in industrial relations has been that enterprise bargaining should be the centrepiece of the system and that that is the way in which the system should develop in the future. What they have done now is downgrade all of that to say merely that it is an option. We all know that in the labour movement, if you have an option, the people who will run the show are basically the ACTU because they are always 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in favour of a legislative framework which gives the unions the majority control in a lot of situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contrast in what they are now saying with what they were saying in government is very stark indeed. For example, the member for Kingsford Smith, in October 1993, when introducing their last reforms which had as a key part enterprise bargaining, said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question asked what was the effect on workers. I can tell you that we do consider that to be a responsibility of this government. In fact, that is a big contrast to what we had when you were in government when, quite frankly, the interests of the workers were the last thing on your mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that quote shows is that Labor moved to enterprise bargaining as the centrepiece of their scheme. The reason they did so was in their very own statements. Prior to the last election they said that the reason you would move to an enterprise based system in industrial relations was that it could produce dramatic gains in productivity and better paid and more secure jobs for workers. That is the reason you would do it. So why is it that they are now moving away from it? The then Labor government, in its platform for the last election, said that the Industrial Relations Reform Act entrenches workplace bargaining as the centrepiece of Australia's industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that Labor has moved away from that which it said was important. It follows a long history. Before the 1990 election they were opposed to enterprise bargaining, but after the election they moved to implement it. In the 1993 election they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2275"> were opposed to our policy to further it, but after the 1993 election Keating endorsed it. In the 1996 election they were in favour of enterprise bargaining, and after the election they are now apparently opposed to it. The reality is that they are not interested in the welfare of Australian workers. There is only one explanation for this shift, and that is that it is an opportunistic shift which they think might curry them with some favour, particularly with the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is determined and resolved. We have shifted the system further back to the workplace to give workers a greater opportunity to have a say in the way in which their workplaces are run but, most importantly, a chance to introduce those work practices that will both retain their jobs and give them a chance of higher pay.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question, which is of great importance to Australia's red meat industries. When we were elected to government some 12 months ago, we found no less than three statutory authorities underpinned by Commonwealth legislation. We had the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the Meat Research Corporation and, overarching them and telling them what to do, we had the Meat Industry Council, which of course had been the previous government's very inadequate response to their own Industry Commission's major inquiry into the problems in the red meat industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was unquestionably an awesomely cumbersome and inefficient set of arrangements. It was the subject of a great deal of criticism by producers feeling, of course, enormous economic strain with low prices about the lack of ownership, the lack of control and the lack of direction that they were able to exercise; and by processors as well, who, as heavy levy contributors, felt that they had no control over promotion campaigns that were of no relevance to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I initiated a major review of the whole set of arrangements last year. I received that towards the end of last year. After a very extensive consultation&mdash;and that was important because this is a historic opportunity to get something right that has been seriously 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wrong&mdash;I announced today that all three statutory authorities will be wound up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Meat Industry Council will simply go. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the MRC will be replaced by a producer owned company. It will be a service provider&mdash;it is very important that its role be clearly understood at the outset&mdash;to industry, owned by and accountable to industry and producers, the levy payers in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy direction and leadership for the industry must be, should be and will be increasingly provided by the appropriate bodies, that is to say, the peak industry councils and their state affiliates&mdash;without the confusion of recent years. That is important because the duly elected representatives that producers throw up ought to be able to do what they are put there for&mdash;that is, to lead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This company will have separate operating units covering research and development, food safety and quality, the maintenance of Ausmeat and a range of other roles such as market access and residue management. On the issue of promotion and marketing, there will be separate institutions, or separate bodies, operating within the company for both beef and sheep meats&mdash;the so&hyphen;called below the split line. There will be no more muddying of the waters, so long a cause of complaint. There really will be proper accountability, and levies contributed by sheep producers and by beef producers will be assuredly spent on promotion dedicated to each of those industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will also be appropriate external performance audits, and a 66 per cent majority vote by levy payers will be enough to dismiss the board at annual general meetings. There will be a commitment to projects rather than program promotion efforts, and those efforts will be, over time, made fully contestable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is making solid progress towards the objective of giving Australians the opportunity of investing in the biggest domestic company which is operating in the fastest growing sector of our economy; namely, telecommunications. The government is on target to have one-third of the Commonwealth's equity in Telstra available for sale before the end of this calendar year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one-third sale of Telstra will ensure the future success of Telstra after the introduction of the post-July 1997 regulatory environment and the entry of new international competitors. The partial privatisation will introduce much needed private sector disciplines of reporting and of resource allocation. The head of Telstra, Mr Frank Blount, said only last week that part-privatisation would make Telstra more flexible and efficient while planned incentive schemes for management and staff would drive motivation and deliver direct rewards for higher productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I was pleased to announce, subject to the conclusion of contractual and fee negotiations, the firms selected to undertake the roles of global coordinators and lead managers. As global coordinators, the firms selected were J.B. Were, ABN AMRO Rothschild and CS First Boston. As joint lead managers, the firms selected were Ord Minnett, Daiwa, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Goldman Sachs/Macquarie Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This selection was undertaken by an independent selection panel consisting of two business representatives and two senior public servants. The role of the joint global coordinators and lead managers is to help prepare the company for sale and to lead the global 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> selling effort of Telstra's shares; to provide advice on all sales issues, such as offer structure and marketing; and to manage the sale project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The firms selected are leaders in their respective markets and have been chosen to provide a balance of sales expertise, international telecommunications experience and a geographic mix designed to attract a broad share registry for the newly listed Telstra entity. Further steps in this preparatory process include the appointment of legal and accounting advisers and the independent adviser to the government who will not participate in the sale of shares. The process of preparing Telstra for privatisation will ensure the ultimate success of the float. The ultimate winners will be Australian consumers of telecommunications services.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I refer to his announcement today of the appointment of Senator Jim Short to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, at a UK tax&hyphen;free salary of some $150,000 a year. Is this the same European Bank of Reconstruction and Development that in its first year of operation spent more money on tarting up its London headquarters with Carrara marble and sycamore panelling than it lent to the whole of central and eastern Europe, which is the purpose for which it was established? Is it the case, furthermore, that the Treasurer's advertised job specifications required, among other things, `a strong record of . . . leadership, judgment and management experience, as well as conceptual and analytical abilities of a high order'? Is his appointee the same Senator Jim Short who was forced to resign from the frontbench last year after what he himself described as `a careless oversight' in which he forgot that he had issued, while he was responsible for banking matters, a banking licence to ANZ Grindlays?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<ANSWER PAGE="2280" SPEAKER="Kemp, Dr David, MP" NAMEID="BT4" ELECTORATE="Goldstein" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Schools, Vocational Education and Training; Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. I know his personal commitment to the young people of his 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> electorate. Lack of literacy skills amongst young Australians has been one of the most serious issues with which this government has had to deal after 13 years of Labor Party administration. As the member for Dunkley says, after 13 years of Labor, some 30 per cent of 14-year-olds could not read adequately and boys' reading capacity had actually declined quite significantly over this period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New research that I released last week showed that boys with very inadequate literacy skills had less than a 50 per cent chance of completing school and were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as those with good literacy skills. Lack of literacy skills does not cause unemployment, but it is very much related to the disadvantages which young people face in the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 13 years of drift on this very important matter, the government took the view that this situation could not be allowed to continue. The Commonwealth government provides some $3.3 billion for schooling each year. The primary purpose of these payments is to teach young people to read and write.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to inform the House that last Friday, in an agreement which some have hailed as historic, the Commonwealth agreed with all the states and territories that from 1998 every child commencing school will achieve a minimum standard of literacy and numeracy within four years. There was agreement that from 1998 students would be assessed against a national literacy standard or benchmark for reading, writing and spelling. Queensland and Western Australia have agreed to move from sampling measures to universal testing of students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All children entering school from 1998 will be assessed as soon as possible to determine their literacy level and teaching needs. Students who need extra help will be provided with that help in order to meet the year 3 standards. An important aspect of this agreement is that the states and territories have agreed to set aside out of their own resources the money necessary to provide the professional development for teachers to make sure that this goal is met. There will be national reporting of the results for each state and

Let me make it quite clear, and underline this, that this is part of the delivery of the government's promise to address the fundamental obstacles which are faced by young people in getting jobs and in getting on with their adult lives.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In early 1995, we on this side of the House were quite pleased that Dr Wooldridge, the member for Chisholm, became the then opposition spokesman on health. He had a pretty reasonable reputation on our side of the House as a decent person. We were also quite pleased that he just happened to replace the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) as the then opposition spokesman on health. You can imagine why we thought it was an improvement when it went from Mrs Bishop to Dr Wooldridge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time that Dr Wooldridge has been the Minister for Health and Family Services in Australia, we have come to raise a number of questions about decisions that have been made. You can understand why John Howard&mdash;the current Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong&mdash;picked Dr Wooldridge, the member for Chisholm, as their spokesman for health. The member for Bennelong was compromised on his policy on health care. He was already on the record as saying that he wanted to pull Medicare apart and that he thought bulk&hyphen;billing was a rort. What he needed was someone warm and cuddly who could try to convince the Australian people that the Liberals could be trusted with health care. They thought that, in the member for Chisholm, they had the person who could do that. The honourable member had been dumped as the deputy leader for Peter Costello, the current Treasurer, but he had been resurrected by the member for Bennelong to try to convince Australians that the Liberals could be trusted with health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we seen in the one year that the minister has had responsibility? Before the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2284"> election, he promised he would maintain Medicare rebates&mdash;that has been broken. He promised to maintain the pharmaceutical benefits scheme&mdash;that has been broken. He promised to maintain pensioner entitlements&mdash;that has also been broken. He promised to maintain the Commonwealth dental health program&mdash;that has been broken. He also promised to maintain funding for public hospitals&mdash;that has also been broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not mind a minister who fights hard to keep his promises but who just happens to get rolled in the ERC by the Visigoths and the Huns who run the ERC. We do not mind a minister who goes in and fights hard for what he believes in. What we cannot stand are hypocrites and frauds who make promises but who are unable or unwilling to stand up and fight for what they believe in. What we cannot stand and what we object to are ministers who make promises, break the promises and then try to find someone else to blame for the fact that they have not met their undertakings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to begin this analysis by starting with public hospitals. It is our public hospitals that are the pressure point, the crisis point in our health care system today. Before the last election, the coalition made a number of undertakings on public hospitals. They said that they would maintain the federal funding for our public hospitals. The current Treasurer even said that he would provide a guarantee that there would be a net increase in health spending. Those were the promises made before the election&mdash;to maintain the spending on public hospitals, federal funding for public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since last year's Premiers Conference and federal budget we have seen federal cutbacks in funding for our public hospital systems&mdash;cutbacks which total $800 million. If you look at the cuts made at the Premiers Conference and in the budget last year you will see that this government cut back federal funding for public hospitals by $800 million.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member interjects and says, `That's not right.' I encourage the honourable member to look at the budget papers and the outcome of last year's Premiers Conference. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) might not know it but the government of which he is a member cut back federal funding for the states by a massive proportion. It was agreed by the states and the federal government at last year's Premiers Conference to cut over a billion and a half dollars. If you look at the current proportion of state spending that goes to public hospitals, you will see that the Premiers Conference cost the public hospital system at least $500 million. They lost $500 million at the Premiers Conference and another $280 million in the budget, which the honourable member for Mallee supported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget that came down cut back $280 million in addition to the $500 million that was cut in federal funding for state public hospitals&mdash;a total of $800 million that is there is black and white for every member of this House to read. I would encourage the member for Mallee, when his local public hospitals tell him that they are under pressure, to ring up Dr Wooldridge, ring up the minister for health. When people are waiting too long to be treated as public patients in your hospitals, ring the minister for health and ask him why he cut back federal funding for public hospitals. You tell your constituents why you voted for that budget which cut back federal funding for your own public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know it is the public hospitals that are under pressure today. It is the public hospitals that are in need. Federal cutbacks in public hospitals are causing patients to wait too long to be treated as public patients. It is those cutbacks in federal funding that are causing people to wait too long in casualty. People are waiting too long to be admitted into beds in our public hospital system because there is inadequate federal funding for our public hospital system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy I cannot stand is when a minister goes on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program last Sunday and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, over the last five years, the Commonwealth has put nearly a quarter more than it was putting into public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This hypocrisy continues. The minister goes on to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2285">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has got a pretty good record over the last five years of supporting and putting extra resources into public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All of that is true, but what I find hypocritical is that the four years of growth in federal funding for public hospitals came from the former federal Labor government&mdash;the former federal Labor ministers for health. And who is the one minister for health who has overseen a reduction in the federal funding for public hospitals? This man over here, the federal minister for health. He has made a reduction in federal funding for our public hospital system. I really do think it is the utmost hypocrisy for this minister to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has got a pretty good record over the last five years of supporting and putting in extra resources into public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Minister, you took out resources from public hospitals, yet you go on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS>  program and try to claim some credit for the fact that your Labor predecessors were able to convince their cabinets that extra money should go into the public hospital system. That is what we consider hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also went on to attack some of the states as a whole. He was not prepared to attack Jeff Kennett and his own state in particular, but I will get on to that in a minute. He said that the states have `pulled out about a billion dollars over five years'. I happen to agree with the minister that some of the states, almost exclusively coalition state governments, have cut back state effort for public hospitals, and that is something that should be changed. That is why we welcome the fact that in New South Wales Andrew Refshauge has increased that state's funding for public hospitals by $600 million over the last few years. I would like to see them put in even more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has the hypocrisy to attack the states for pulling out a billion dollars over the last five years when this minister has himself taken out $800 million from federal funding for public hospitals. Minister, don't you think it is a bit galling for you to preside over reductions of that order and then take some pot shots at your state colleagues for also reducing government expenditure on public hospitals by a similar amount?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we find even worse is that before the election, this minister made a guarantee to the people of Australia. He said that they were going to come up with a new you&hyphen;beaut solution to every problem in our health care system, and it was called a tax break for private health insurance. Sure, it was going to cost $1.5 billion but he would make sure that there were no cutbacks in public spending to pay for this new incentive for private health insurance. He promised there would be no cutbacks in funding for public hospitals to fund the private health insurance initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we find galling is that when you look at the cuts that were made last year, they have done exactly that: an $800 million cut in federal funding for public hospitals, a $400 million reduction in the Commonwealth dental health program, and a $500 million reduction in Commonwealth assistance for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. When you add those three together&mdash;your cutbacks in federal funding for public hospitals, the Commonwealth dental health program and the PBS&mdash;you made reductions that total $1.7 billion. That just happened to balance the very tax break that this minister is prepared to pay the private health insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem that the minister has is that everyone is walking away from this government's centrepiece of its health policy. We even get the minister's close personal friend, Jeff Kennett, saying that this private health insurance initiative is money down the drain. We get the AMA saying that this initiative is poorly targeted. We get the government's own inquiry saying that the government is spending $560 million a year to save only $240 million. They spend $560 million to save only $240 million. So when Jeff Kennett, the AMA, and your own inquiry all say that the centrepiece of your health policy is a failure, why aren't you prepared to look afresh at your measure? Why is there so much arrogance in your administration that you are not prepared to admit the fact that the $1.7 billion private health insurance initiative is a failure? Everyone else acknowledges it is a failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that they put to us before the election was that this tax break would lower 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2286"> the cost of private health insurance and in some way that would increase the number of Australians with private health insurance and, therefore, reduce the pressure on our public hospitals. But what have we seen in the last 12 months? We have seen increased premiums and dramatic increases in the cost of private health insurance. Those increases have swallowed up most of the benefit of the tax rebate and, even before the rebate starts to be paid, we have got 800 people a day leaving private health insurance. We have got people leaving private health insurance because of all these changes. And if the minister will not listen to us&mdash;and you will not listen to Jeff Kennett and you will not listen to the AMA, and you will not listen to your own inquiry&mdash;then why don't you perhaps listen to your good friends at MBF, who produce this survey on private health insurance every quarter? Because even though the MBF is not considered to be exactly a strong supporter of Medicare and the views that this side of the House advocates, the MBF survey has shown in its latest research that the proportion of current fund members who say they will be encouraged by your tax rebate to maintain their private health insurance has fallen dramatically from 82 per cent to only 57 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last year, almost one in three of all of the current health fund members have reached the conclusion that your policy is a lemon. It is a lemon that obviously is not encouraging people to maintain their private health insurance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or in Box Hill. Why spend $1.7 billion indirectly through the health insurance funds rather than spending it directly on patient care? Everyone else says that would have been a much better way to reduce waiting times and reduce pressure on our health care system. But the only response of this minister&mdash;and the only response of this government&mdash;is to try to come up with new ways to prop up their failed health insurance initiative. And the way they are going to come up with it&mdash;their new initiative&mdash;is to force middle income families to take out private health insurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last budget, they brought in the Medicare surcharge, allegedly on `high income' earners who do not have private health insurance. And yet in the secret minute from the minister's own department, which we released on 6 March in the House, we made it clear that this government is currently considering reducing the threshold at which that Medicare levy surcharge bites in. So it starts off as just a surcharge on high income earners to force them to take out private health insurance and, before long, they are looking at ways to lower that income threshold step by step so that eventually we will end up with a system where middle income earners are forced to take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With 800 people a day leaving private health insurance, is it any wonder that you have got to come up with sticks like tax penalties to force people to take out private health insurance? But even when you force people to pay a higher Medicare levy and you raise more money through the Medicare levy, what is this minister's response? Does he say that that money should be put into our public hospital system to arrest the problems?</PARA>

So I went to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  and had a look at what happened on 10 October 1996&mdash;it was a sitting day&mdash;and, in fact, there was a censure motion on that day from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley).

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The employment data released today by the ABS indicating that job growth has fallen because of the government's budget strategy.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">It is quite clear what has happened here. This was a matter of public importance that was so important it was prepared six months ago. The member for Dobell clearly got rolled by employment data coming out at 11.30 a.m., so the member for Batman snuck in his MPI just before the 12 o'clock deadline&mdash;and this MPI has been sitting around since October. In the 12 sitting weeks since October you have not been able to get this MPI up till today when clearly, thrashing around, the strategy committee could not find anything to run a matter of public importance on. So they said, `Pull out the old one you have had sitting around, Michael.' But he forgot to change the date on the notice. I table that for the information of honourable members.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came to government let me tell you what I found as health minister. I found the Medicare rebate system, the size of the budget of Western Australia, increasing five per cent real a year. I found radiology completely out of control in terms of costs, with services like ultrasound going up 21 per cent in the previous 12 months. I found a system of pricing radiology that was so absurd it paid exactly the same rebate for someone using a CT scanner that was 15 years old compared with the latest CAT scanner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found with nuclear medicine that, while the cost was increasing, the previous government had set up a hatchet job, put a consultancy out and the recommendations for that did not recognise that the increase in nuclear medicine was essentially the emergence of a new profession, and had those recommendations that were engineered by the previous government been taken on board it would have destroyed totally the profession of nuclear medicine. We found pathology, in spite of several attempts to reduce outlays, again, out of control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found psychiatry so loose that one practitioner could see a patient 747 times a year and bill for 747 75&hyphen;minute consultations and successive years of attempting to negotiate with the College of Psychiatrists had been absolutely unfruitful. We had assistance at operations provided whether or not there was any requirement for that assistance. We had skin lesions increasing as a proportion of items. Again, there was strong anecdotal evidence from the medical profession that there were rorts in that area. That is what we inherited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of doctor numbers, we had very clear indication on that from two former Labor health ministers: Graham Richardson, who said that he told the AMA in 1993 that unhindered increase in doctor numbers was unsustainable; and Brian Howe, who also said that to do something about doctor numbers would destroy Medicare. What was done? On the issue of numbers, nothing. On the issue of overseas trained doctors, there were several attempts over a decade to do something all of which were totally ineffective.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2288">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an area like public health we had Australia ranking third worst in the Western world for completed childhood immunisation, something that has been confirmed as late as the September quarter last year. We had diabetes, in spite of numerous reports&mdash;the most recent being the rise and rise of diabetes&mdash;and something which is responsible for a very large proportion of Australia's health care costs, completely neglected. It was not one of the country's major health priorities. We had hepatitis C, about which there has been substantial publicity in recent days, completely ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an area like Aboriginal health we had a complete lack of coordination between Commonwealth, state and territory governments. We had over 200 communities that had no access to health services whatsoever. With the greatest single threat facing Aboriginal people, that of HIV&hyphen;AIDS, in spite of being 13 years into the epidemic we had no coordinated response whatsoever. We had cost shifting that was out of control, costing the Commonwealth somewhere in the vicinity of $300 million per year. We had bleats from previous health ministers about how awful it was but we had no effective action whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a system of public hospitals whereby the Commonwealth had put in more money in the last Medicare agreement and had no capacity whatsoever to have any control over the states just taking the money out. The then government knew this. The Leader of the Opposition when Minister for Finance walked around the country, wailed and bleated and said how awful it was, but what have they done? Nothing. The situation the public hospitals are in today is as a result of that inactivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In rural health, we have a further decline in doctor numbers in rural areas. There was no particular training focus meeting the needs of trying to get people out into rural areas. Of course we had private health insurance, an area about which a former Labor minister, Graham Richardson, said during the election campaign:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, again, Labor aren't recognising the big problem. It is still a huge problem, by the way, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that people are deserting private health insurance at the rate they are, a much faster rate than anyone in the Government's been predicting and it just goes on and on.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the issue of a surcharge for high income earners, Graham Richardson had this to say after the budget in August last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when I left&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the Labor Party&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as the Labor Party had always been a bit biased against private health insurance . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That really sums up everything that has happened over the last six months on that score. He then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One idea I had which had no chance of ever being accepted by my caucus or cabinet colleagues was to charge an increased Medicare levy for high&hyphen;income earners who refused to take out private insurance. I was never comfortable with the thought of wealthy people elbowing battlers out of queues in public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Spot on, Graham Richardson. Neither am I.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were looking to the future, to the things that offer us some prospect of making our health system sustainable in the medium term, what did we have? Coordinated care had completely stalled with the medical profession up in arms and we were facing a new Medicare agreement when the last two Medicare agreements under the previous Labor government had instituted no substantial reform whatsoever but had merely been saying, `Let's keep the system going and put a bit of extra money in it.' If there is a reason why we are in the situation we are in today, it is a combination of those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister talks about keeping promises. He is on fairly hollow ground here. He should have a look at his own party's 1993 health policy document. I will read out a few things from that health policy document. In fact, I can find 12 broken promises here, and that is just on pages 4 and 5.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, they promised new initiatives in the private sector&mdash;$100 million over four years. What happened? They spent $13 million. Second, private hospitals would be included in the health services regional planning agreements. It was not done. Third, the aged care industry review would examine the adequacy of nursing staff to meet the increas 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2289"> ing dependency of those living in hostels. Well, you had three reports&mdash;Gregory, Keys and Macri&mdash;and not one of them looked at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourth, the national rural health program would focus on expanding the rural health centres initiative and developing rural health plans. When we came to government three years later, there was nothing to find. Fifth was access to Medicare rebates for bone densimetry for women at risk of developing osteoporosis. It never happened. Sixth was the establishment of a national health promotion authority. It never happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seventh, legislative reform to the National Health Act would ensure Australia's commitment to the promotion of public health. It never happened. Eighth was the provision of language services in public hospitals. In spite of the fact the Commonwealth does not fund public hospitals directly, it was a promise you could not keep and it was a promise that did not happen. Ninth was the establishment of a national advisory council on ethnic health. It never happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tenth was the continuation of the national health strategy. The member for Jagajaga, who is in charge of that, knows that was axed immediately after the 1993 election. Eleventh was the development of a national primary health care policy. It never happened. Twelfth was a national environmental health strategy. It never happened. That is from only two pages of your 1993 health policy document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the issues of substance that the shadow minister raised, I will talk about hospitals and about private health insurance incentives. The shadow minister claims that somehow the Commonwealth has reduced funding for hospitals by $800 million. Yet of that, he calculates $500 million as being one-third of the $1.5 billion the states offered to give the Commonwealth to help with the budget black hole that we were left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not follow logically in any sense that because the states offered to make a contribution to help the Commonwealth's deficit a cent of that money will come out of hospitals. In fact, looking at total health expenditure by states on hospitals in 1995-96 and then in the following year 1996-97, our indications are that the expenditure will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> almost certainly go up. You are saying that $500 million is being cut out, when states are spending more money. It does not follow. It is illogical. It does not stand up. It simply is not sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of saying that we have actually cut money from hospitals, this year we are spending $67.2 million more than we did last year&mdash;an increase of 1.4 per cent which, given the low rate of inflation, will probably turn out to be a real increase, far from the reduction of $800 million that you are accusing us of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of private health insurance, the shadow minister makes a number of assertions. The best way I can respond to that is to look at the Labor Party's 1996 policy document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Leadership</EMPHASIS>. The page entitled `The family health rebate' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For families. Family private health insurance premiums. How does the rebate work? There is a flat rebate of $350 for the cost of private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then, in the indications that are given here of an eligible family we see:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mario and Sue have three children and receive family payments. They are eligible for the Family Health Rebate of $500 a year. The family has private insurance hospital cover. Under the Family Health Rebate the family would receive $350 towards their health insurance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister makes much of 800 people a day leaving private health insurance. Yes, I am concerned about that. But what he did not say is how many were leaving prior to 1996&mdash;about 1,300 to 1,400 a day. So, in fact, the rate of decrease has halved over the last two quarters as people are waiting for the private health rebates to come in. That is important because there is a very large number of Australians, probably over 700,000, who have incomes under $20,000 a year and who have private health cover. What were you offering them? Nothing at the last election. Nothing, because they didn't fit your demographics of the voters you wanted to attract with your private health insurance bribes that you are now criticising us for trying to implement. But these rebates are fair because they cover a much higher proportion of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, what we have had from the opposition is nothing about the future for health, nothing about how we will meet the needs of an ageing population, nothing about how we will introduce new technology and nothing about how we will make Medicare sustainable in the long term.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard a mealy&hyphen;mouthed response from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) which will not do anything to disguise the fact that, as a member of the federal cabinet, he has been an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> absolute failure in his attempt to do a job for the Australian health industry. Once again, he has been a doormat for the Treasurer (Mr Costello). He has shown that he was unable to win the battle in the budget last year, and he is now off to sign a health agreement with Ireland. I hope he does not gyp the Irish in the same way that he has gypped the Australian public with what he has done here with health care. Today, being the day after St Patrick's day, would probably be the day he would decide to do that. That is just what this government is like. It does not matter what promise they make, you can rely upon them to break it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last election campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave very specific promises about health. In fact, the Prime Minister's polling told him that one of the most important issues to Australians was Medicare. So he went out there and made all these weasel speeches about how he believed in Medicare; he thought Medicare should stay. In February 1996, he said that `health benefits will not be cut; health spending will be boosted in net terms under coalition health package reforms'. That is what he said before the election, and the people believed him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what happened after the election? The 1996 budget marked the beginning of the end for the universal health care system in Australia, a system which has served the needs of Australians very well. The 1996 budget saw a net cut of $1.7 billion over four years to the health budget. So much for the Prime Minister's promise to maintain health benefits. I wonder where would we be if he had said that he was going to cut them; where would we be then? So much for his honesty and so much for the honesty of the Minister for Health and Family Services. As I said earlier, it has become obvious that the minister is just a doormat and a stand&hyphen;up for the Treasurer to knock down every time something comes along.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, in the bush that you represent in this Parliament it has always been a matter of pride for Australians in the country and the city that we have access to high levels of health care in public hospitals. I have heard members from the National Party 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2291"> come in here whingeing year after year about how terrible it is that there is not enough help for public hospitals. I have not heard any of them whingeing about what this Minister for Health and Family Services has done&mdash;and what he has done to public hospitals has been something terrible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next four years $800 million will be cut from hospital budgets by this government. And the National Party just sits there and says, `Well, that's all right, we probably did it ourselves, it's not really our fault.' The truth is that it is your fault, and you should be sticking up for the people of your electorates. But you do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last budget we also saw the government make a massive attack on pensioners and their health. The government has made cuts to schemes such as the Commonwealth dental program, which the Labor government introduced. We heard National Party members tell us in this House year after year that that was a good scheme; in fact, I think Mr Deputy Speaker I recall you saying that. But what has happened to that now? After 1 January this year that has gone, as has gone the dental health of older Australians and the unemployed and people on health care cards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before this scheme was brought in, the statistics of the Labor government supported the fact that the only access most people who were pensioners or on health care cards had to dental health was, in the main, to get their teeth out. In fact, that group of people had 87 per cent more extractions than any other part of the community. What has happened now? They are back to having to have their teeth out. Michael Wooldridge has put the bite on the budget and they have lost the bite out of their mouth. That is what has happened under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is that none of these people even care. The government's cruel abolition of the dental health care scheme means that tens of thousands of pensioners and the unemployed will be forced back to having to have their teeth extracted rather than having fillings because they cannot afford them. Abolishing that program will seriously disadvantage many thousands of Australians just because they are poor. That is the only reason 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they are going to be disadvantaged&mdash;because they are poor. Of course, that does not matter to John Howard and Michael Wooldridge because they have won the election. The big con worked, and now it is whip into the health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in government, we decided that we should do something for hearing services. But what has the current government done about that? By introducing the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997 and the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill 1997, the current government will be denying many Australians the right to hear properly, for a paltry saving of $1 million&mdash;and it calls that a reform. This legislation will cut off 19&hyphen; to 21-year-olds from access to Australian Hearing Services, and it will cut off about 30,000 seniors card holders from Australian Hearing Services. Thirty thousand people will no longer have access to the hearing service, for the saving of a lousy $1 million. So much for the Prime Minister's promise to pensioners of Australia that he would not be removing any entitlements that they had. It is another broken promise to those people who are seniors or health care card holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to hearing services are not fair. They are not fair to people with hearing losses, and they are not fair particularly to young Australians who have hearing loss because poor young Australians who can no longer afford to have these services will find that their chance of obtaining skills, work and a reasonable life, like their friends and relations, will be put at risk. Why? So that the Prime Minister and Dr Wooldridge can save a lousy million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another measure introduced in the budget which will have an increasing impact on Australians was the government's decision to cap bulk-billing payments made to doctors. It does not take an accountant to figure out that, as doctors' costs go up, pressure will increase on them to stop bulk-billing patients. Low income earners especially will be hit by this measure, but they will not be the only ones. Many ordinary Australians know the cost involved in taking a number of children to the doctor over winter when they are suffering with coughs and colds, and they will not be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2292"> able to afford to do that any more if doctors do away with bulk-billing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today in this House we saw the minister's response to a dorothy dixer about what to do with doctor provider numbers. I would have thought we might have heard from the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) on that today, because he has always been very keen on quoting Dr Birrell in here. In fact, he was so keen on it he never mentioned that he was quoting from one of Dr Birrell's speeches, until the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) reminded him of it.</PARA>

If they do not believe that ordinary young doctors should be able to get provider numbers, when is it going to be good enough for them to hand their's back. But, once again, we hear the minister falling back on his mealy&hyphen;mouthed response when he says, `Of course, I could give my provider number back in, but then the law let's me reapply for it.' Well, change the law. They are the government: change the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Better still, the minister and the member for Bradfield could stand up in this House and give an undertaking that they will not use their provider numbers. Have they done that? Of course not. They want to stop young doctors from having a career, but it is all right for them to keep their provider numbers. They will keep themselves on the gravy train, yet they say that everyone else wants to get on it and that that is shocking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the member for Bradfield had been keen on mentioning what Dr Birrell said some time ago, he might have reminded the government&mdash;if they had let him into this debate, which they are not game to&mdash;that restricting the number of young doctors who can get into the Medicare provider scheme will put pres 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sure on doctors and there will be fewer and fewer doctors going to the bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we hear from the National Party about that? A member from the National Party is going to speak next in this debate. I want to hear what he has to say about that. Will he say something about the lack of young doctors in the country because of what this government has done? We will not hear a word from him about that. We will hear nothing&mdash;nothing. They are part of the problem; they are not the solution. They are like the minister. The minister gets run over by the Treasurer, and the National Party gets run over when the truck hits them on the way through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government has done to Medicare is disgraceful. I draw the minister's attention to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>.

They will spend $560 million saving $240 million for people on private health insurance. If that is the way they want to run the economy, it frightens the life out of all of us. This minister is a fraud. He will not stand up for himself. He will not stand up for his department. He will not stand up for the health industry. He will not stand up for the poor.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear that the Labor Party has never understood the problems confronting an electorate like mine. I have been challenged to make a contribution. I have had a lot to say in the formulation of the policy that this government has adopted to address the very issues that confront my 23 hospitals. I am the member in this parliament who has the largest number of private hospitals of any electorate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2293"> in Australia. How many private hospitals does the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) have? How many private hospitals does the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) have? Does he have nine? There are nine private hospitals in the electorate of Mallee covering 26 per cent of Victoria. The people in these isolated communities that support their private hospitals know jolly well that, without their private health insurance, they will lose their hospitals&mdash;because they cannot accept public patients. The Labor Party has never understood that difficulty. Now for the first time in 13 years we have a minister who is prepared to address the real problems confronting the people for Mallee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a number of occasions the member for Dobell has challenged me over whether or not I support the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). I do, because for the first time in 13 years the very problems confronting the people of Mallee are being addressed. The member for Watson mentioned doctors. Where was the Labor Party for 13 years when my 22 hospitals were struggling to attract Australian doctors? I have been in this parliament for four years. Thirteen of those hospitals have gone through the trauma of trying to attract a doctor in the last 13 years. Of those 13, nine of them had to get foreign doctors because the previous government did not have a comprehensive policy to address those issues. This government does. We are about making it happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell mentioned hypocrisy. I hope you will forgive me if I stand here with some misgivings about this matter which is considered to be of national importance. The fact that this proposed discussion has been sitting around since October makes a mockery of that. All of a sudden, because there does not seem to be anything else to attract the attentions of the Labor Party, they want to raise this issue. Where were you for 13 years? Where were you then addressing the needs of the people of rural Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not stand up here and challenge members of the National Party. We are now participating in two things. One is trying to address the nation's problem with its deficit. That is difficult enough. That is the legacy the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian Labor Party left behind. The second is trying to create good social policy to address the needs of rural people. The Labor Party has never understood that. This government does, and I am delighted to have an opportunity to support the minister. He really does not need to be defended against this matter, because it lacks integrity as it appears on the program of business today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell must not be able to add up. Budget paper No. 1 shows an increase in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget allocation through the Medicare agreements of $4.97 billion. That is an increase of $67 million. So how could you possibly raise for discussion cuts in funding to hospitals? Medicare raises about $3.6 billion. The balance comes from consolidated revenue. If there is any misallocation here, as I have said, it is simply an allegation. It does not apply to the current government; it applies to the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sooner you stop being transparent about this issue and accept some responsibility for the damage that you have done to this nation over 13 years, the sooner you will get a lot more credibility from the people you are now trying to appeal to in my electorate. They see through your transparency with this bleating about private health insurance. Albeit it is not much of a rebate, it is something, and it has arrested their departure from private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why doesn't the shadow minister spend some time talking to the people in Charlton, in Rainbow, in Sea Lake and in Birchip; people who support, through their own contributions, the establishment of bush nursing hospitals? They are private hospitals owned by the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have in my electorate eight bush nursing hospitals and one separate shareholder owned private hospital in Mildura&mdash;the largest number of private hospitals in Australia. That recognises the importance that people in my electorate place on private health insurance, because it is a 2&half; hour drive, a two&hyphen;hour option, to go in an ambulance to some provincial centre. So do not try to preach to the people in my electorate about actions that this government is taking to preserve the integrity of private health insurance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2294">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the figures, in 1983 63.7 per cent of the Australian population participated in private health insurance. Who came to government in 1983? I ask that question and that is the question they ask. The latest figures in June 1996 show that only 33.6 per cent of people participate in private health insurance. That is a big decline while the Australian Labor Party presided over the public policy that directed this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very serious matter that this raises for my people, who are an ageing population, is that only 29 per cent of the Australian population under 65 years of age participate in private health insurance. That means that the proportion above 65 is higher&mdash;well above 40 per cent. That reflects the nature of the people in my electorate. Burning in my ears from 4 o'clock yesterday were the words of a constituent who came into my office and said, `Please do what you can to preserve the integrity of private health insurance.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something the Labor Party has never really understood is that private health insurance is a vital part of the provision of health care in this country. Even Richardson said that if private health insurance dropped below 40 per cent that would put unbelievable pressure on the Medicare system. We are now talking about a participation rate of 33 per cent. That is why there are waiting queues in public hospitals in the big cities. We have now got a generation of people below the age of 30 who say to me, `Why do I need private health insurance?' Even my own staff said that in a discussion a few hours ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My family is like any other family in Australia. Every time I get my health insurance bill for $2,500, I have to have a discussion with my wife. But we have maintained our private health insurance because we live in a rural environment and it is going to be very difficult for us to get the doctor of our choice if we have to consider an ambulance drive to a larger provincial centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So do not preach to members of the National Party about the government's approach on this. It is being addressed. It may not yet be perfect, but we are looking to build on our current policy and to make sure that we provide to all Australians a broad based 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> health care system that is fair and equitable. Let us have no more of this bleating from the Australian Labor Party, who lack credibility after 13 years of policy neglect.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many Palestinians living on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip are suffering economic hardship and experiencing a serious fall in their living standards. High unemployment is a major problem for them. The extension of the ASTP concessions to the Palestinian Territories will assist the economy to transform itself from one dependent on exporting labour to one exporting products made in newly established industrial enterprises. It will also enhance bilateral trade with Australia. The Palestinian authorities have already indicated their interest in purchasing wheat and live sheep from Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As you realise, this is a nice speech that needs to be continued. Doing business is tough in Australia. The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, the member for Forrest, Mr Geoff Prosser, said in the latter stages of last year:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor has no credibility on small business issues.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Nor should they, for they have no experience when it comes to business. It is not their fault; it is just that when they take risks they would prefer to take risks with other people's money&mdash;other people's money being of course the taxpayers' money. We know about the Labor Party's misuse of public funds during their period of office, but that is really another debate for another time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Life was tough for business under the Labor Party government. Under Labor, bankruptcies were at a record level of more than 14,000 in 1994-95. Under Labor, businesses struggled under the weight of compliance imposts. The Labor government imposed on them the fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax, the superannuation guarantee levy and the failed training levy, which is doing nothing to reduce the cost of compliance. Labor raised the provisional tax uplift factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the Labor government did not cause all the resulting problems associated with this, but they contributed heavily to many of the social issues we are now faced with. The Labor Party put everything on the bankcard, on the cuff. Because they put it on the cuff, Australia almost lost its shirt. This includes the shocking figures for youth unemployment. Youth unemployment accounts for almost 45 per cent of the total unemployed and in Cowan it is an unacceptable 27 per cent. It is a terrible statistic that requires the whole community to support solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you are no doubt aware of the government's utmost desire to fix the terrible problems of Labor's legacy. This includes giving small businesses, which are the backbone of the nation's economy, the chance to grow and profit. Business is such a major factor of our society that, when it suffers, we all suffer. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2296">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having worked in a wide range of occupations myself, I have come to realise the importance of small business. Small businesses are often the ones affected by spiralling debts. The Western Australian Small Business Development Corporation was able to provide me with figures relating to bankruptcy in Western Australia which brought to light an interesting point. In our state, the lack of business ability has overtaken economic conditions as the No. 1 cause of business related bankruptcy in Western Australia. Economic conditions are still the major cause overall in Australia, at 26.4 per cent. Of the 275 Western Australian business related bankruptcies reported during the 1995-96 financial year, one-quarter were attributed to poor business skills. In some ways, it is encouraging to know that government policy is not the major&mdash;nor the sole&mdash;offender, although it is on a national level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, it is still a very disturbing fact that people continue to move into business without adequate training or a sound knowledge of precisely what they are getting into. Inappropriate business decisions can be made, leaving the way open for more problematic factors to feature, such as the accumulation of debts. Other significant causes relating to bankruptcy in Western Australia were economic conditions, at 22 per cent, and lack of capital, at 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995-96, bankruptcies directly caused by business activity accounted for approximately 15 per cent of all Western Australian bankruptcies and 27.5 per cent of all Australian bankruptcies. Out of all the states and territories, Western Australia was one of only three to experience a decrease in business related bankruptcies. Furthermore, Western Australia had the second highest fall after the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be noted that a business related bankruptcy does not necessarily equate to an actual business closure. Even though Western Australia's level of bankruptcies has been increasing since 1994-95, this is due to an increase in non-business bankruptcies. Obviously, it is apparent that a bankruptcy does not necessarily have to follow liquidation. A business or a company can signify many 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> different things and bankruptcy or liquidation are just two stages of this. I believe the world of the small businessperson is about to enter a new positive phase under this government, with various initiatives either already in place or not far around the corner which will make the life of the small businessperson much easier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's small business initiatives include reducing the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent, cutting red tape, delivering capital gains rollover relief, moving to scrap Labor's unfair dismissal laws and arresting the slide of budget deficits. All these will provide a small business with the certainty and support it needs. This positive feeling does seem to be supported not only by government initiatives but also by various studies published by the Western Australian Small Business Development Corporation. According to this organisation, using statistics from the ABS, over the last decade the number of small businesses in Western Australia has increased at an average annual rate of 4.8 per cent, the highest annual growth rate of all states and territories. The corporation also published results of a small business opinion survey, which found that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even after a year of low profit levels and variable trading conditions, small business is anticipating increased sales and prices in 1997 to boost profits.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">An example of the renewed vigour in small business was recently brought to my attention by a company in my electorate which has become a virtual runaway success. Business has been tough for this business over the last decade; however, it is now reaching levels of productivity which it has not seen before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This business makes quality, very large and very expensive signs. That would seem fairly trivial, but these signs are quite spectacular. I saw a recent example of this when I stopped to view their latest project, the distinctive world sphere sign that sits on the top of Planet Hollywood restaurants in Australia and in Asia. This particular sign has a six&hyphen;metre sphere and 2.4&hyphen;metre&hyphen;high lettering. The sign is destined for the Planet Hollywood in Melbourne, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, so when you visit that august place of eating you will be able to see it. It was actually made in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2297"> Western Australia. This company has already made signs for restaurants in Sydney, Singapore and Bangkok and is looking at doing some more on the Gold Coast, in Auckland and in Guam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps to my eastern states colleagues this may not seem terribly remarkable. But to a Western Australian this signifies a great achievement: that a local company is able to compete not only in the national marketplace but also in the international marketplace. This is in consideration of the fact that in many senses we have a few natural disadvantages in Western Australia that can often stand in the way of competitiveness. The eastern seaboard does not need to consider such factors as the isolation and distance factors. This relatively small company, called Signlight Neon, is able to employ up to 50 local people to carry out its operation, which obviously has advantages for the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although there is every indication that this business will continue to do well, it is not the only business that is doing well within Western Australia. Small business is obviously very important to Western Australia. It is very important for Australia. Business will still be tough to do in Australia, but it will be much easier under the coalition's policy and initiatives than it was in Australia under the Labor Party. This bill is supported by all those that have an interest in any of the matters associated with the bill. It has no financial impact on the government. It is a bill which will help business and I commend it to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This report follows a decision made early last year that the human rights subcommittee would proceed annually to review the proceedings and the activities of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Commonwealth Ombudsman. It reflects the proceedings of seminars, which enabled the members of the committee to engage in discussions with those two respective office&hyphen;bearers on issues that are of mutual concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to thank all involved in the seminars, in particular the chair of the subcommittee, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent); Sir Ronald Wilson, the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission; Mr Chris Sidoti, the Human Rights Commissioner; the senior adviser to him, Mr Kieren Fitzpatrick; as well as the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Ms Philippa Smith&mdash;all of whom gave their time to attend and to inform the committee about their work. I would also like to thank the staff of the joint standing committee, in particular Margaret Swieringa and the staff of the human rights subcommittee who organised this very successful seminar program and drafted the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report itself embraces some five resolutions and I want to address those briefly. The first two essentially are matters that I am delighted to be able to report to the House, in part because my wife, through the work she has undertaken with the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, NAPCAN, has been advocating these measures for some considerable time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first recommendation was that the Australian government should introduce legislation to incorporate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into domestic laws. Members will be aware of the Teoh case and of the implications of that. While this is not an alternative, it certainly appears to us to be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2298"> essential that, having subscribed to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, we should now adopt it into domestic law. The repetition of events such as those that occurred in the Teoh case should not then recur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second recommendation suggested that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) investigate the feasibility of establishing a children's commissioner within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That and the last resolution, which is within the Office of the Ombudsman, both identify particular problems that emerged from the seminar. There should be a children's commissioner. I think most members of this House would concur. There have been far too many cases of child abuse and far too many cases of sexual abuse; far too many cases where children have been the victims. The ways by which they can best be represented are matters not just of state jurisdiction but I think very much matters for the federal parliament and I very strongly recommend to the government that they take up that second recommendation of this seminar's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next three recommendations relate to the Office of the Ombudsman. I have little doubt that my colleague the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) will identify his concerns with respect to item 3, so I will pass that by. But one of my concerns about the Ombudsman has always been that an Ombudsman should never replace the work undertaken by senators and members of this place. I have always felt that people who go to the Ombudsman should recognise the work that is undertaken by federal members, and in many instances that work could obviate the work that otherwise goes to the Ombudsman. We do have a responsibility to our constituents and I think people need to recognise that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to identify recommendations 4 and 5 very briefly. We think a parliamentary review of the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman needs to be done to look at the resources of the office to make sure it is adequate for the purpose. The fifth recommendation is that we think there are particular problems for indigenous Australians. We do not think that the Ombudsman's office is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adequately equipped to pursue those problems at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think there does need to be, therefore, a specific person in the office of the Ombudsman to fulfil that function. We have suggested that an indigenous Australian should be appointed to the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to ensure that they can undertake within the Ombudsman's office that task. In saying that, I also hope that individual member's offices employ indigenous people, because that too provides another vehicle by which you can relieve these obvious difficulties that occur so often at a time when we are aware of too many racist problems and when there are quite real difficulties in many parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both HREOC and the Ombudsman have confronted racism. They see it as a significant issue. Therefore, I think it needs to be pursued. There is no doubt that, if we take note of that recommendation with respect to the staff of the Ombudsman, it would fill the notable gap. I therefore commend this report to the parliament and suggest to members and to the government that these five recommendations are matters of which they should take serious note.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It is always a pleasure to welcome the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), especially in his capacity as Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Like him, I wish to commend the chairman of the human rights subcommittee, in particular for continuing to maintain an Australian as well as an international focus on human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the two officers who were part of this seminar&mdash;that is, the Human Rights and Equal Community Commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman&mdash;form a very important part of the Australian fabric of human rights. I think it is worth noting that Sir Ronald Wilson now completes his seven-year term as chairman of the human rights commission. This has followed a very distinguished career on the High Court. I often think it would be nice if we as a parliament were able to acknowledge the contribution of outstanding Australians. I certainly believe that he falls into that category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support with the same vigour the first two recommendations of this report but, as the right honourable member for New England says, I do have a particular interest in the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. It was very clear when the acting chairman, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), had the Ombudsman before him that indeed ordinary Australians are suffering as a result of cutbacks to the office. I note that in the last couple of weeks of the last sittings of parliament we put through legislation to establish the Auditor-General as an independent officer of the parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really important that the consideration that has been extended to the Auditor-General be extended to the Ombudsman's office. We must understand that every time we restrict the budget of the Ombudsman, as we did in the last budget, we effectively limit ordinary Australians' ability to contest administrative decisions on a no-fee basis. We also avoid the opportunity for the Ombudsman to scrutinise administration rather than just deal with individual cases and to make recommendations to departments to fix systematic errors of administration. So those changes benefit a whole range of ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to note that a group of people who are victims of a lack of jurisdiction of the Ombudsman are small business people. They do not have an ability to actually take their cases to the Ombudsman, because much of Commonwealth work is now being outsourced&mdash;but I do not want to enter into that debate. The Ombudsman has detailed in successive reports the impact this is having on small business. I sincerely hope that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will expedite the legislation that will fix this want of jurisdiction. As I understand it, it is neither disagreed with nor controversial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recommend there be a parliamentary review of the Ombudsman's office. I sincerely hope that we will have that opportunity. It does not necessarily have to be conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee. I sincerely believe that, if we fail to do that, we will be letting down the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least I would like to concur with the right honourable member for New England that there is no better person than a dedicated member of parliament across a problem capable of providing solutions to ordinary people. I think no matter how good or how effective an Ombudsman's office is, it will never replace the role of members of parliament. Regrettably, from time to time the executive constricts the ability of members of parliament to seek redress on behalf of their constituents. I think that is something to be regretted. I commend the report to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I used to claim that I as chairman of the committee was far more productive than the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2300"> previous chairman. I thank the right honourable member for New England for not claiming that but, demonstrably, a lot of work and reports are being done. The chairman of the human rights subcommittee and the chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee can take great comfort in the number of reports&mdash;they are certainly worthwhile&mdash;they are delivering to the parliament. I am not sure that the other two subcommittees are working as effectively yet. I thank the staff for their assistance in the preparation of the report.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As chair of the human rights subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak briefly. There are a number a points that I would like to make in respect of the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman: report on public seminars 20 and 25 September 1996</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I will comment very briefly on the matters concerning the Ombudsman, which the previous speaker, the member for Chifley (Mr Price), covered pretty comprehensively. The key point to make is that, obviously, we are very keen to see the Ombudsman retain the independence of that office. That is probably the most fundamental matter that our committee is concerned about and, therefore, the recommendations that we have made in this report are very much directed in that sense to making sure that that independence is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the budgetary constraints, obviously they are difficult. They have been applied in a number of areas where they are equally difficult. Given that the amounts are relatively small, perhaps some review of that cutting back could occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to speak very briefly about the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and about both Sir Ronald Wilson and Chris Sidoti. I am pleased the previous speaker mentioned Ron Wilson. I would like very much to say a couple of words about Ron Wilson personally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Ronald Wilson is a former High Court judge. He is coming to the end of his term as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the head of HREOC. He also was the inaugural Deputy Chair of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation for three years. As a member of that council, I served with Ron for three years&mdash;I have now been on for a further three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to say that Sir Ronald Wilson has been one of the outstanding Australians of our generation, a man of a good age who still regularly commutes from Western Australia, travels around the world and the country and does not stint himself in the service of his fellow Australians in any shape or form. I think his contribution to this country has been very considerable. I think it is important that we recognise that contribution in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Ronald Wilson gave the committee some very harrowing accounts of some of the evidence that was coming forward in his inquiry into the stolen children&mdash;the Aboriginal children taken away from their parents. Quite clearly, his report in that area is before the government and we look forward to a positive response from the government to the recommendations of that HREOC report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that HREOC report is a very important report because, if you do not understand the significance of the impact on many indigenous people of having been taken away from their parents or having had their children taken away from them, then you do not understand the root cause of many of the problems of disadvantage today. If you do not understand the causes, then you cannot fix the problems that are manifest today. So I think that is a very important report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to comment very briefly on some of the comments made by Chris Sidoti in the human rights area. Chris Sidoti, apart from the matters that we have explicitly covered in this report, also talks about some of the regional matters of human rights. We should not lose sight of the fact that the human rights movement in this country has outstanding international standing. Certainly, we look at areas within Australia where there might be some deficiencies and where there are on occasions some deficiencies, but equally we do have a good international record. We are making a major contribution to human rights in the area. We often need to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2301"> make that contribution because the human rights records of some countries in our area are less than perfect by a long way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chris Sidoti and others have been very instrumental in setting up regional human rights mechanisms. The chair of the joint standing committee, the member for New England (Mr Sinclair), last July attended a regional forum in Darwin. In a couple of weeks time, in early April, there is to be the next regional forum in New Delhi.</PARA>

I think it is an important responsibility and one which we need to continue to undertake as one of the leaders in that field and as people who not only have got the financial resources to do so but have the track record and the skills to do so. I think we can make a major contribution in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course we are concerned about racism. We do have a proud record as a country in our multicultural society. Racism is certainly nowhere near as bad here as it is in many parts of the world, but there is no doubt all is not perfect and I think it is important that we are ever vigilant as a parliament to guard against such things, to speak out when it is necessary and to make sure that we do not spoil that record. I know the members of my subcommittee, as well as the full joint standing committee, take that task very seriously. I commend the report to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I would like to address a number of issues raised by the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), the previous speaker in this debate on the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1996. The member expressed concern regarding the number of small businesses going into bankruptcy. Of course that is a matter for regret and it is indeed a matter for concern that that number is increasing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cowan referred to factors which he believed played a role in that occurring. But what he did not refer to and did not acknowledge&mdash;and this is common to just about all government members&mdash;is the dramatic and drastic effect of the government ripping such a massive amount of money out of the economy. It is literally taking customers away from small business doorsteps and has really caused severe problems for not only small business but the economy generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the failure of the government to announce policies to address unemployment has caused fear and insecurity. Far from people feeling relaxed and comfortable, as was promised in the last election, there is real apprehension out there. It is a very bold person who is going to commit themselves to a major purchase such as a car or a house when there are such feelings of insecurity. Any car dealer and any real estate agent would tell you the consequences of that fear of unemployment. If you add to that an absence of any policy in relation to developing industry in this nation, you get a bleak picture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cowan also suggested that the government had the means to address this small business decline and referred to the repeal of the former government's unfair dismissal laws. The facts of the matter are that, if that is the best the government has in their armoury, we are all in real trouble. We are all in big trouble because the government itself does not understand its own legislation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2302"> and it certainly did not understand the former government's legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, on about four occasions the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) has stood up and berated the former government for relying on International Labour Organisation convention No. 158, which dealt with the concept of unfair dismissal. It seems the minister does not appreciate that the relevant part of his legislation dealing with unfair dismissal specifically has, as one of its objects, furthering the International Labour Organisation Convention. That is defined in section 4 of the act as being set out in schedule 10. All the minister has to do is look at schedule 10 which is set out in the act itself to see ILO convention No. 158.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if the minister says departure from the former government's policies and departure from ILO convention No. 158 are going to resurrect small business and employment in this country, we all, as I said before, have real problems on our hands. The only repercussion that the government's legislation has had, by introducing a few hurdles and somersaults that applicants in unfair dismissal cases have to go through, is to shift unfair dismissal cases into the state sphere. My information is that in the last two months in New South Wales we have seen a 200 per cent increase, for instance, in unfair dismissal cases. If the government thinks it has created some sort of new order, it is sadly mistaken. I suggest with respect to the minister that he obtains a briefing from the experts in his own department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spent my time so far addressing and replying to points raised by the member for Cowan. One final point that he raised which I would like to address is his praise of the concept of risk undertaken by business entrepreneurs. What I would like to emphasise is that risk is not only taken by business entrepreneurs. Every day workers get on the train or get in their car and go to work and face risk in industrial accidents. Any solicitor's office around this country is likely to have several&mdash;indeed, many will have scores of&mdash;quite serious, and in some cases, horrifying injuries sustained by workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some industries, it is still the case that a spouse waiting at home does not know wheth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> er their partner is going to come home with a serious injury. Mining is one of those industries. Indeed, although they have been damned and condemned by this government, the waterfront is still a very dangerous industry. Workers who go along there face considerable risks. So my point in this matter is that the government should really appreciate that economic growth in this country is not solely generated by the activities of entrepreneurs. Rather, it is literally built from the sweat and, regrettably in many cases, the blood and flesh of Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to move on to the topic of the bill itself. In 1992, the Corporate Law Reform Act introduced a new system for the voluntary administration of companies. It allowed a system whereby an independent administrator could be appointed to take over the charge of a company for a limited period of time. The thrust of that bill was significant because it was one based on mutual cooperation between the debtor company and the creditors and the independent administrator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme allowed the company to operate under a deed of company agreement. That deed was one that essentially bound all parties&mdash;that is, the company, the creditors and the administrators&mdash;as to the course of action to apply in dealing with the company's affairs. It specifically precluded another creditor from claiming some sort of priority over other creditors by acting inconsistently with that company deed of arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many circumstances it was acknowledged that the best people to run the company were the directors themselves&mdash;obviously because of their contacts and their industry knowledge. The voluntary administration allowed in the 1992 act certainly facilitated that, providing that the administrator generally oversaw the operations. In other words, it enabled a company facing difficulty to request the appointment of an administrator as an alternative to the old sudden death system of appointing a receiver. That was a significant and welcome advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, that was a factual background in the now famous Crawford House case. The issue in that case was whether debts incurred by a company still under the control of the direc 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2303"> tors, but in a situation of voluntary administration, received the same priority as that which normally attaches to debts incurred by an administrator, where the administrator is left in control of the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Usually, it is that later case that is adopted whereby the administrator himself is in control and any debt incurred by his actions receives priority at the end of the winding up. But the situation in the Crawford House case where the directors were left in control is still not uncommon and in many cases desirable. Obviously, it is more likely to occur if the creditors regard the directors as reputable and competent. In many situations, if not most, they are going to be the most able to deal with the company's affairs because of their long history of commercial relationships and their knowledge of the industry generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many instances, the creditors of the company will cooperate in that situation because they have a vested interest in the company's survival. Because of the interactions in commercial relationships, many creditors will be suppliers or purchasers of the particular business. If they lose a link in their trading network, obviously their businesses are going to be the worse for it. So there is often a vested interest in creditors cooperating and trying to save one of their trading partners. I think it is fundamentally important that creditors so cooperating to save one of their trading partners not be penalised. This bill, it must be said, substantially addresses that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, normally, if the administrator was left in control of a company, the debts incurred by that administrator would get priority. This bill essentially ensures that debts incurred by the company under the ultimate control of the administrator, but through the actions of the directors, receive that same priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Justice Cohen in the Crawford House case itself indicated that his conclusions as to the direction that the law took him were regrettable. For instance, in his opening address in the judgment, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conclusion I have come to, if correct, can result in creditors of a number of companies which have entered into deeds of company arrangement 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> having no fund upon which to claim for payment of their debts if the company should in due course be wound up. This would be a matter of serious consequence for the commercial community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Unfortunately, he felt compelled to arrive at that conclusion. He summarises the effect of his conclusion later in the judgment with these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This results in the regrettable situation that there appears to be no right in those who became creditors of the company or whose debts were increased during the period of the operation of the deed, to prove for those debts or increased debts. This would not seem to be a result intended by the legislature.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Later on, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not satisfactory that the position should be left as it is and it requires urgent legislative amendment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In fact, the former government had proposed a bill very similar to this and the opposition hence supports the government's actions. It is probably desirable that the legislation moves in a direction which encourages administrators to leave directors under control. While most administrators are competent and honourable, the facts of the matter are that they charge their time at professional rates and often that hourly rate of somewhere between $200 and $400 an hour is the final straw which causes the company to go under.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall a recent speech by the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) in which he gave an account of a business in his electorate which faced a very similar situation where an administrator took over control of that company. It seemed inevitable from that day forward that the company was going to die a slow death, whereas if the directors had been left in control there would have been every chance that the company would have survived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is highly desirable that the legislation does as this bill does: that is, it does not cause an impediment to directors being left in control of a company facing financial difficulties. If the company can survive, employees of the company are going to benefit&mdash;not to mention their families. As I have said, company insolvency is often contagious, so any arresting of the decline of a business partner can keep secure its trading partners.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2304">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, there are very sound public policy reasons for justifying the legislation. I note the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) in his second reading speech has expressed that the only reservation is one of addressing the question of priorities generally. We, in the opposition, would agree with that. It is appropriate that the issue of priorities in company receiverships and bankruptcy be addressed. I note the government is to refer that question to the companies and securities advisory committee. The opposition would most certainly endorse that occurring. From my own personal point of view, I think there should be some rewards attached to trading partners taking a risk to try to keep their associated company or trading partner alive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that this bill is topical in another sense. It was addressed by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in the context of announcements by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) the week before last. The Treasurer indicated the government's intention to review corporate law generally. He said that he intended to review the law to give it a stronger economic focus so that businesses could undertake their businesses with low transactional costs and that, as a starting point, he would be addressing the Australian accounting standards boards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note the Treasurer's comments that he regarded the law as too proscriptive and too legalistic. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 20 November 1996, he is reported as favouring a system of self&hyphen;regulation of a scheme of business ethics, which he believes will promote investor confidence. I must say that I have concerns about a voluntary code of ethics. I do not think, from my experience, that it will go anywhere near addressing a number of concerns that shareholders have. They still have concerns that there is inadequate reporting in respect of the foreign activities of companies. Even though they receive balance sheets regarding local activities, there is usually very scant information provided as to the foreign activities of companies of which they are shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the procedures for the reporting of related party transactions are very inad 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> equate. Equally, there is a generally inadequate methodology in the Corporations Law regarding the election or appointment of directors. While substantial work has been done since the days of Clyde Cameron in 1972 to ensure the democratic election of trade unions, very little of that seems to have been translated into the Corporations Law. It is one area where there is a severe lack of democratic control. That is something which is inevitably going to deter ordinary Australians from investing in the share market and buying shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">News Corporation is a case in point. For instance, a recent article reported on the techniques of News Corporation in selecting its board members. That is achieved by one of News Corporation's in&hyphen;house lawyers going around with another director and virtually head&hyphen;hunting the board members. I should say that the board members are the government, as opposed to the chief executives of the company. If one anticipated that occurring in respect of a trade union, in which the members of the committee of management were not democratically elected, there would be a public outcry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government must be alive to the fact that the Australian public is becoming increasingly educated in the affairs of corporate investment and the activities of corporations. Much more information is being communicated to them through the general press, business papers and, of course, electronic communications. The Australian people are in a position to judge, and judge appropriately, the standard and quality of directors, and this government should urgently look at taking steps to encourage the democratic participation of shareholders in the composition of boards of companies.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I want to sum up the debate, and thank the four or five speakers who have participated in it. I will go back over a few of the key points of the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1996. This legislation has come about due to the voluntary administration scheme, in part 5.3A of the Corporations Law, becoming an increasingly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2305"> popular means of dealing with companies that find themselves in financial difficulties. The objective of that scheme was to provide a swift, flexible and inexpensive insolvency procedure which focused on saving the company's business, rather than the company, and preserving employment prospects. So it is an important aspect in the situation in which companies find themselves in difficulty that we make sure that it is a straightforward process. This amendment is about clarifying that process and making sure that there is security for those people who attempt to ensure that that company keeps going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A large proportion of companies using the scheme are successfully negotiating deeds of company arrangement with their creditors, allowing them to continue with their businesses rather than going into immediate liquidation. It is important that, while those companies are under a deed of company arrangement, creditors are not discouraged from supporting them by trading with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will resolve an anomaly in the legislation whereby creditors who trade with a company under a deed are at risk of losing any claim on the assets of the company if the company should subsequently go into liquidation. The bill will render those debts provable in a subsequent liquidation. The bill has the support of the Law Council of Australia and the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia. The related issue of whether the debts should not only be provable, but should also receive priority treatment, is a more contentious one, though not as urgent. In this regard, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has referred the issue to the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, which is reviewing the operation of the voluntary administration scheme as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that members have had a reasonably wide&hyphen;ranging debate on this issue. It is not a contentious debate. The opposition supports this legislation. It was almost entirely the same bill which the then government had prepared. We have picked up on that legislation. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 amends three acts of this parliament, two of them substantively and one in a technical way. The two substantive sets of amendments I will deal with briefly. The first set relates to the Airports Act 1996. There are a variety of amendments to this act which are essentially tidying up amendments to various oversights or difficulties which have emerged from that legislation, which was passed roughly six months ago by this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some examples of the amendments are: the adoption of a tiered process with respect to offences and penalties for environmental matters, which ensures that there is, in a sense, a cascading sequence of penalties that can be applied so that people can be found guilty of and penalised for lesser offences rather than greater offences; and an obligation to be imposed on all persons to comply with an airport environmental strategy rather than just to be imposed on the airport operator. This fixes an oversight in the original legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One rather spectacular amendment imposes an obligation upon an airport lessee to operate the land as an airport. It is rather surprising that was not in the original legislation. Other amendments are: a requirement of consultation with respect to major changes to airport master plans be undertaken in line with the original requirements with respect to consultation; a requirement upon the minister to extend consultation beyond the operator for the exercise of certain powers under the legislation; prohibition on subleasing an airport through means of trusts to avoid the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2306"> act and guidelines on how the airport should be operated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a variety of other specific amendments in this section which I will not go into in detail but all of them are essentially tidying up provisions to facilitate the operation of the Airports Act. The opposition strongly supports these provisions. It does illustrate&mdash;an observation I have made a couple of times in the past in the debate on the sale of the airport leases&mdash;that there will be a substantial learning process with respect to the airport sales. Already I think some problems and issues are emerging that were not necessarily conceived at the time the former government was dealing with these issues and have not as yet been addressed by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cite as examples the question of future investment and, in particular, the distinction between investment in non&hyphen;aeronautical airport activities and aeronautical activities, which may lead to an imbalance between the two, and the question of price capping and concerns that I have indicated about the likely future effectiveness of the price capping arrangements that have been adopted. These are just a couple of examples of problems that I think we will have to deal with in the future. It will be to some extent a learning process and I suspect there will probably be other difficulties that emerge as well. The fact that we are already amending legislation does indicate that that is going to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second substantive set of amendments relate to the Air Navigation Act, one of which is to establish a register of encumbered aircraft so that prospective buyers of aircraft can have some information about any legal encumbrance that may exist on the aircraft. I understand that there are a variety of circumstances where parts of aircraft can be encumbered as collateral for loans and the like and it can actually be quite confusing and difficult for prospective buyers. The proposal to establish a register has the support of the opposition. It does not entail any legal implications with respect to the relationship between buyer and seller, but it should facilitate the process of purchase of aircraft and make things a bit easier for prospective buyers and therefore has our support.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second section, which the opposition does have a couple of amendments to, relates to the approval of international charter operations by the secretary to the department. Under the previous provision, the essential criterion which applied in this case was `the need to provide reasonable protection' to the Australian aviation industry. Under the new criteria proposed by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in the amending act, there is a list of concerns which the secretary to the department must take into account prior to granting an approval for an international charter. These include such matters as consumer needs, promotion of trade and tourism, aviation security, the location of the services concerned, international relations generally and the criteria that are followed by the International Air Services Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does have a slight concern, albeit a substantive concern, about the drift of this particular set of legislative amendments, the concern being that there is a gradual shift occurring under the new government towards an open skies policy. The opposition does not oppose the concept of broadening the criteria which govern the secretary's decision with respect to granting international charter rights but in the context of some other decisions that the government has taken we do wish to register our concern at the gradual drift in aviation policy which may ultimately be to the significant detriment of our two major national operators, Ansett and Qantas, and the Australian industry more generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicate that I will be moving two amendments circulated in my name, the second of which is actually a condition or contingent amendment. There are two options there depending on whether or not the first is adopted. I will not go into the detail of those amendments. That will be dealt with in the consideration in detail stage. I will flag what they relate to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of these amendments would add an extra criterion to the government's proposed new set of criteria for the secretary to the department to consider and that would be `employment and investment in, and general development of, the Australian Aviation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2307"> industry'. The second of these amendments would be to apply the same set of criteria to any decision by the secretary to the department to exempt a particular charter operation from the requirement to be given approval. That power is currently in the amending legislation. The amendment that we will be moving would seek to ensure that in exercising that power the secretary would take note of the same issues that he would have to take note of in exercising his power to grant an approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the government's intention with respect to this power of exemption is that it would relate to, in a sense, one&hyphen;off charters to unusual or very small or low key situations. Certainly, we do not object to the intent of what the government seeks to do with the legislation. Our concern is that the power that is granted to the secretary to exempt is a fair bit broader than that intent applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have indicated, the opposition does have some concern about what we would see as a drift towards a more open skies policy. Clearly there is a difficult balance to be maintained here. Competition in international aviation needs to be fostered, but at the same time we need to make sure that there is a viable Australian international aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very proud of the fact that we have an internationally renowned carrier in Qantas, which has a worldwide, top&hyphen;class reputation. Clearly, we want to make sure that Qantas can continue to operate and function in a similar way to the way in which it has historically functioned. We can also take great pride in the fact that we now have a second Australian international airline in Ansett. We look forward to Ansett's share of the total market increasing&mdash;preferably not at the expense of Qantas but at the expense of other international operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote from a press statement the minister put out on 10 June of last year relating to charter flights, particularly in the freight area, to indicate the general drift that is occurring in policy. The minister stated in this press release that freight was being neglected in favour of passenger demand and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the government would seek to `bilaterally negotiate significant increases in dedicated capacity for air freight services in key export markets' and that `an APEC model air freight agreement for greater liberalisation of air freight operations' would be sought to be developed and the government would seek to `liberalise the freight&hyphen;charter approval process for carriage of Australian exports'. Finally, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout the world, passenger charter services have served to stimulate international tourism growth by providing seasonal services on many routes not normally served by scheduled carriers, at prices affordable to tourists who would not otherwise travel internationally.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As you would recollect, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, having chaired the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform which did a study on air freight recently, the lack of available freight charter capacity is not really a major problem in the total picture of Australian airfreight. Clearly there are issues associated with capacity, but the findings of that committee, which you chaired, were that there are numerous problems that appear all along the chain and there is no great single dominant problem. There are a number of problems with our airfreight situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to popular myth, Australian exporters actually get access to pretty good airfreight prices, primarily because they are cross&hyphen;subsidised by passenger tickets, because the vast bulk of the airfreight currently goes out in passenger planes. I do not necessarily agree with the minister's comments on freight charters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to tourism, the statement the minister made in that media statement is in fact broadly accurate, but it fails to recognise that we have a slight backloading problem in Australia. Tourist charters that operate, for example, between Britain and Spain clearly have a fair potential to operate with substantial passenger loads in both directions. One of the difficulties with tourism charters to Australia is that in many instances it is very difficult to maintain the number of people going from Australia with sufficient regularity to make the charters economically viable.  Clearly, ultimately people have to go back to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2308"> where they came from, but the time they wish to spend in a particular place is going to vary and the volume you are able to get in a charter operation is going to depend on the amount of demand for travel in both directions. That will be a significant influencing factor. I question just how strong that is likely to be in Australia. That may be a significant restraining factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that today the government will vote against the amendments we will be moving but is going to give some further consideration to them subsequently. The minister may wish to elaborate on this in his closing remarks. On that understanding, we will not seek to divide on the two amendments we will be moving. The matter can perhaps be revisited when the bill gets to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude with a reference to my concern about the government's general approach to transport and transport policy; that is, transport in essence is primarily a cost and little else. It is more than just a cost. Yes, it is an important cost consideration for the vast bulk of the Australian economy in a direct or indirect way, but transport, particularly in aviation, is also a major export earner. Qantas is our third largest individual export earner. Ansett is now earning substantial export dollars directly as an international carrier and, as I indicated before, hopefully will increase its share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Qantas's market share is now below 40 per cent of the Australian international aviation market. I certainly hope that it does not go much below that. I think our international aviation market, where Australian operators supply roughly half of the total, is probably about right and has a reasonable balance. It is important that we do not alter our policy framework in a way that might derogate from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the proposals the government are enacting are not likely to have a sudden, direct impact on the viability of Ansett and Qantas, but it is important to ensure that we do not, through the back door, introduce competition that is outside International Air Services Commission agreements and which might undermine the economic viability of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Qantas and Ansett services and might undermine their capacity to compete with the other international operators that ply the Australian routes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern I have is that the government, in pursuing its general direction in this area, is focused excessively on the issue of cost, which is important, and is failing to focus on the importance of maintaining a viable Australian international aviation industry which, as I have indicated, delivers very substantial export dollars and a large number of generally highly skilled and generally well&hyphen;paid jobs to Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Efficiency is important, but so is the capacity to participate in our society, to have employment, to earn a reasonable income and to have a reasonably skilled job. I think there will be a role for additional foreign charter flights in the future in the areas of freight and tourism. It is reasonable to anticipate that that section of the aviation industry in Australia will probably expand. The minister and I may differ a bit on precisely how large such an expansion might be. But, as I have indicated, I think it is very important that any such expansion not undermine to a significant extent the viability of our existing international carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to ensure that safety concerns are protected. CASA has undertaken recently a program of enhanced safety examination of foreign carriers. We have a lot of foreign carriers coming to Australia from small countries. Sometimes there are question marks over the maintenance regimes, in particular, that apply to the aircraft and sometimes there are question marks over the age of the aircraft&mdash;things of that nature. It is very important that we maintain our overall safety profile and performance. Increasing the access of foreign charter flights to Australia is one way that safety could conceivably be undermined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be interested to know what discussions the minister has had with Qantas and Ansett about this legislation. I hope that he has consulted with them about it and that he has had some discussions with them, because these issues do ultimately affect their viability  and capacity to operate as major Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2309"> operators and as an important Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's amendments are not designed to protect the Australian industry and not even designed to be as strong as the previous criteria were. They are simply to ensure that, in the criteria before the secretary of the department in making decisions about granting international charter approvals, there is some reference to the interests of Australian industry. At the moment it is virtually the only thing, the one aspect, that is left out. All of the other issues that have been put in the draft legislation are entirely legitimate and perfectly reasonable to consider. The one thing that is missing is the potential impact on Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that change is made to the legislation, we feel that it is entirely supportable and worth while. As I have indicated&mdash;I will wait to hear what the minister has to say in reply&mdash;on the understanding that the issues will be considered further in the context of the matter being in the Senate at the end of this week, we will put up the amendments and, on the assumption they will be voted against by the government in the House today, will not seek to divide in the hope that we can reach some agreement in the context of the Senate debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997. A lot of legislation passes through both houses of parliament. From time to time a particular piece of legislative framework is introduced that creates some interest for members. I think it would be very difficult for a member to try to cover all the legislation that is introduced into this House. This bill, I believe, does have a great deal of interest for those living in the Northern Territory and in remote areas of Australia, especially those with very good tourism destinations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand from reading a press release today, the government is currently negotiating to lease airports in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth to interested parties. Also, the government has recently announced that the evaluation and short&hyphen;listing of stage 2 bids for long-term leases of these airports are complete. The government is offering 50-year 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leases, with options being available for a further 49 years. Nine consortia were short&hyphen;listed in October last year and have lodged bids for one or more of the phase 1 airports. Six consortia have been short&hyphen;listed to proceed to the next phase of the process, and they will be required to lodge revised offers by the middle of April this year. It is envisaged that the sales will be completed before 30 June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The press release which has been issued by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in the last 24 hours would certainly alleviate the concern expressed by the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). He thought there were some hiccups and that the government was having a few problems. My understanding is that the minister has made a statement that the sales should be completed before the end of this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main purpose of the bill is to amend the Airports Act 1996 and will consequently allow for certainty for new and existing airport operators and ensure that the Commonwealth has a clear regulatory framework for the operation of these airports. The bill also amends the Air Navigation Act 1920 relating to charter operations of which I will speak later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill includes provisions to ensure a better standard of environmental protection at Australia's airports. These provisions include: variable penalties for breaches of environmental standards; providing new offences for deliberate harm to the environment; power to allow pre-existing contamination to be addressed; prohibiting subleasing to trusts; requiring public comment on proposed plans or developments to be sought by the lessees of airports, and ministerial approval; and a statutory requirement that airport lessees actually use the airport site as an airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal Department of Transport and the office of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development have been working on the development of regulations governing the environmental standards required, in consultation with Environment Australia. These regulations will ensure that the responsibility 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2310"> of maintaining correct environmental standards lies with each and every person undertaking an activity at an airport that will affect the surrounding environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 130 of the act already stipulates that the airport lessee take responsibility for the monitoring of any environmental issues caused by the airport. This will now be expanded to include all other persons undertaking an activity at an airport site to take the responsibility of ensuring that the environment is protected. It also authorises the Commonwealth to set limits of aircraft movements at airports, and it allows for public reporting by the ACCC on competition issues like pricing and practices at airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some difference of opinion between the states and territories on the after&hyphen;sale lease powers that the Commonwealth will have. This is reflected in the state&hyphen;territory opposition to the land planning powers, building authority function and environmental authority function that the Commonwealth will have. I know that the Northern Territory government has some concerns about the balance of power between the different levels of government post FAC. It is my hope that the Commonwealth will delegate some of those responsibilities to the territory government, which has an excellent record in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill prohibits the subleasing of airports to trusts on the grounds that it may be a way of sidestepping the ownership provisions of the act. Therefore, the amendments will prohibit a trust being declared as a sublease and, consequently, prohibit the separation of the legal and beneficial interests of a lessee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also amend the Air Navigation Act 1920 in order to facilitate quick approvals for international charter flights, establish a register of charter aircraft pursuant to the provisions of the act and add some clarification to technical details.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have mentioned, I have a special interest in charter flight operations. So I welcomed the government's decision last June to move towards a more liberalised and flexible international air charter market. This led to the release of updated charter guidelines for charter flights in Australia. Charter 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> airlines, particularly in remote Australia, have the potential to provide some healthy competition to the scheduled airlines, particularly in the area of tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one thinks about Alice Springs being the centre part of central Australia and Uluru being a much sought after destination, there is absolutely no reason why international charter operators could not fly into central Australia. Alice Springs could become a hub which would then support Qantas and Ansett domestically by having a two-hour flight to Sydney, a two-hour flight to Brisbane, a one hour and 50 minute flight to Adelaide and a two&hyphen;hour flight to Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister for transport was concerned that there may have been a restraining factor. I think it would make sense if Concord were to fly into central Australia because there are no environmental requirements and no curfew. That may become a very interesting factor in terms of the development of tourism in central Australia. Other operators in the Asian region would still have the capacity of discharging passengers in central Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those passengers could be flown to other destinations, brought back into central Australia and flown back on the charter on which they originally started. That certainly has some interesting prospects. Those prospects were not available before the minister introduced his amendments. There is a lot of work to be done by the various tourist commissions. With private enterprise, there is no reason why charter operators cannot use the territory as a hub. That is something that the Northern Territory government would be very interested in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another interesting factor is that of freight. I have known of instances where Flying Tiger used to bring their cargo from overseas ports into Australia and then fly empty from Sydney over Darwin and back into Singapore or other Asian ports. I always thought that was a waste of a resource, especially as the territory in the last five years has developed a tremendous horticultural market. Only 10 years ago horticultural development in the Northern Territory was worth about only $1&half; million to $2 million per annum. Now it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2311"> exceeds $60 million per annum. We are able to export some of our produce to northern areas such as Sabah in Malaysia and Singapore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Flying Tiger were able to bounce into Darwin and pick up a couple of tonnes of freight, that would certainly help the development of the horticultural industry. I believe the amendments as proposed by the minister would have some validity if approved by the secretary to the department of transport. There are certainly some avenues which will open up. I do not know whether the opening of the blue sky policy, as mentioned by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, is the objective of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation provides those operators with the capacity, after obtaining approval, to move in and out of the country both with freight and with passengers. The amendments in the bill will go another step in freeing up the operations of charter companies by streamlining approval processes for applications while strengthening protection for consumers by ensuring that passengers are indemnified for financial loss should the charter not fulfil its obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While northern Australia has had a fairly liberal charter policy for some time, this bill enables quick approval for multi&hyphen;destination charters. The amendments also provide for the establishment of a register. It is envisaged that the register will be managed by Airservices Australia and will list information on encumbered aircraft. This will be a national register, and it has the in principle approval from all states and territories. The Northern Territory government already has complementary legislation. So a move to the national register should not pose any major problems. While acknowledging that this is only an information register and does not guarantee title, it is a useful and welcome initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst restating my concerns that the balance between the Commonwealth and the territory be preserved, I want to mention some of the other operations of the FAC at airports. I want to highlight one particular instance which has caused me some concern. A coach operator who had permission from hoteliers to pick up guests from the airport and transfer 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them to the various hotels as a courtesy service had his operation ceased by the FAC in Alice Springs. The reason for this was that the FAC had entered into an exclusive agreement with another operator to take those passengers to various destinations in Alice Springs, but those people did not have bookings. They were simply walking off the aircraft, looking for transport and were able to use the bus shuttle into various parts of Alice Springs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I felt very sorry for the operator because he had gone to a lot of trouble to make arrangements with the various hoteliers to transport their guests from the airport to the hotels in the various locations. Because of a regulation of the FAC, the road into the FAC was virtually closed off. This prohibited the operator from going in to pick up passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise that this does not have anything to do with the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1). However, if somebody bought an airport, what extension would the legislative process provide for the protection of those people needing to do business at the airport? With those few comments, I commend the bill to the House. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development will obviously pick up some points raised by the shadow minister, and I will listen with interest to that.</PARA></SPEECH>

But, when it is moved, I support the action that he has indicated and certainly understand the likelihood of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) looking at the worth of that amendment; and, whether there is an opportunity to embrace that in any ultimate legisla 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2312"> tion, I am conscious of what activity is taking place there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have looked through the bill that is before us and through the minister's second reading speech, and also a speech made by the minister to the Orient Airlines Association at Sanctuary Cove on 29 November last year. I want to draw upon some of his remarks in that speech and some of the information that he provided in the course of that speech, because it contained a quite comprehensive analysis of the international aviation industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two largest aviation markets in the world are the United States and the European Community, with 280 million and 360 million people respectively. Those two markets recognise the economic importance of having strong aviation and shipping industries and the multiplier effects of those industries. Yet I have to say that this Treasury&hyphen;led doctrinaire government, a captive of the economic rationalists, never misses a chance to hit Australia's shipping and aviation industries. Earlier this session, the government pushed through cuts to government assistance to Australia's shipbuilding industry and depreciation allowances for Australian flag shipping. That assistance had been initially established to encourage the growth of both of those sectors&mdash;shipbuilding and ship operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the intended effects of this legislation is to weaken the role of Australia's international airlines, Ansett International and Qantas, in the international market. I will compare that a little later with the attitude of the European Community and of the United States which have very strong and protective policies towards their international aviation industries. The ultimate result of that is to transfer jobs offshore under the pretext of increasing the size of the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I looked to the minister's speech of 29 November last year I saw he made the point that Australia has been pursuing a policy of keeping the capacity ahead of the demand. That is a very good doctrinaire approach, but when the capacity is so far ahead of demand, that 40 per cent of the capacity that is available into and out of Australia is not utilised, that is something we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> need to look at fairly closely. There needs to be a balance in all of those things. As I said, when I look at the really big players in the world and look at the policies they are following, I ask: with all of the strength that they have and all of the market opportunities available to them, what leads them to pursue the policy they are following and are there indicators there that we should be taking notice of?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look at Australia I see that at present only 60 per cent of the total seats available&mdash;just under 200,000&mdash;are actually operated each week by the airlines. There are 330,000 seats available each week into and out of Australia but only 200,000 of those seats are operated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister made the point in that speech that Australia's international aviation policy is aimed at liberalisation but that we are not pursuing open skies. There is a fine line there. I can see the objective, I have listened to the shadow minister and I am conscious of the previous Labor government's policy, but the warning I want to give is that it is a fine balance. When you look at the United States, when you look at the Asian airlines operators, when you look at the growing conglomeration of international airline operators around the world, we are but small bit players. We are small bit players in the global sea and just how much risk can we take with what are really fledgling industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look down further, you will see our share of traffic into and out of Australia has increased from 38 per cent to some 42 per cent in 1996 with the operation of Ansett International. Again, Australia's market share has been declining. So we should work through and look at what is happening in the rest of the world and what we are doing here with our policy. There is another issue, but I will come back a little later to look more at the European scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at some of the airlines operating into Australia&mdash;and it is helpful that the minister is here at the table when I am making these remarks because I want to talk about the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the onerous task that that organisation carries&mdash;we see that just over 41 million people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2313"> travelled by air in Australian air space in 1995&hyphen;96. That includes domestic majors, domestic regional operators, the few that go by general aviation and all of the international travellers who come into Australian airports or go out of Australian airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority, from a report I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS> of 3 March 1997, has found some `major safety deficiencies' with an international airline which is flying into Australia&mdash;into Sydney. CASA has covered some six or eight airlines and found that one had some major deficiencies&mdash;and the minister would quickly be able to recall which one that is without my naming it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With 50 international airline carriers coming into Australia, it is vital that they are checked for safe operation, for airworthiness and for safety deficiencies. Let's not blindly accept that, because an aircraft is registered in another nation, that nation has the same attitude towards airworthiness and safe air operation as we have in this country. We are one of the leaders in the world, but there are all sorts of flagged aircraft coming into this country now that have differing levels of safety and safe operation. So unsuitable aircraft&mdash;the aviation equivalent of Panamanian registered ships, I am sure you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;create the fear of an accident occurring. We need to be concerned about the possibility of unsuitable aircraft, especially high&hyphen;passenger planes such as Boeing 727s and 767s, and they need to be watched and they need to be supervised from an airworthiness standpoint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example of a safety concern is an airline, which did not land in Australia, where a plane was registered in one country, chartered to another country and operated by a crew from a third country who were licensed by a fourth country,  for instance by the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States, and probably had a multiracial crew&mdash;just to make you happy!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last month, in that period that was reported, CASA banned 13 international airlines from landing in Australia and put another 15 on notice to improve their air safety regulations. CASA is currently concentrating on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inspecting the 15 carriers who are on notice, but eventually it wants to inspect every foreign carrier entering Australia. I believe that the Australian public demands no less than that achievement. There is a blind acceptance&mdash;rather, it is almost like a blind expectation&mdash;that international aircraft are really absolutely safe and, if they have a flag on the tail of the country of origin and they are registered overseas, they will be right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know the reality is somewhat different from that and the level of risk varies greatly as we increase the number of aircraft, the flags, coming into Australia. With the prospect of charter operators coming in, there is clearly in the charter industry&mdash;if one looks closely, like in the shipping industry&mdash;a greater incidence of older aircraft often operated by organisations or businesses that have lesser durability than their standard scheduled operators who have a much greater market image to protect. The risk, in my mind, of crash and injury is greater with some of those operators. I have to qualify that. I do not want to raise the alarm, but we do need to recognise the reality of the composition of that industry. It is a different industry to the scheduled operators. Those remarks I made about CASA are drawn from the DCN of 3 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inbound tourism flows out of all of this, because the purpose of growing the international airline industry is to grow inbound tourism. Inbound tourism is constantly presented as the panacea for all of Australia's ills. However, in the general community, there are increasing numbers of Australians raising questions about who benefits from increased inbound tourism. There needs to be clear policies and industry initiatives in place to ensure that Australian businesses and Australian men and women gain income and employment from increased inbound tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increased inbound tourism can bring benefits, but there have to be effective policies in place to achieve those benefits. Increasingly, at an electorate level, I am told of foreign travel agents selling tickets to foreign visitors who travel to Australia on foreign airlines and travel from the airport in foreign made and foreign owned buses to foreign owned and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2314"> foreign managed hotels. Having rested at the hotels, they proceed outwards to foreign owned facilities or recreation activities and foreign owned duty&hyphen;free stores staffed by foreign staff to buy goods. They go back to the hotel and back on their foreign controlled buses back to the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am asked the question&mdash;I am sure a number of my colleagues here in the House have been asked the same thing&mdash;`Well, what does Australia benefit from that?' With regard to the incidence of vertical integration, I do not know the answers; that is why I am raising it in this debate. It needs to be addressed and those questions need to be answered. Where is the benefit to Australia and does that kind of vertical integration benefit Australia? If more foreign activities being vertically integrated do benefit Australia, is there a mirror of that, where Australian owned businesses are similarly vertically integrated in their journey abroad? I would like to think that they were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parting remark that I usually get in that kind of discussion is a sort of dismissive sentence that goes something like, `Well, it seems to me we get to make some of the beds and wash some of the dirty clothes, thanks very much.' But it is a serious question and it is that perception that needs to be addressed. I have seen a number of current affairs shows and I have seen it addressed on various television semi&hyphen;documentaries. It is a problem we need to address if we are going to continue to have the support of Australians for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand people forming those views of inbound tourism in light of the media coverage that I have referred to. The question of vertical integration needs to be addressed. That leads me to the next point. We regularly hear calls from the industry for less and less supervision of tourists coming to Australia. Some spokespeople wanted visas abolished altogether. I am looking here again at the DCN. It is not my favourite journal that I read all the time, but it just so happens that I noticed these articles&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SHARP" NAMEID="AJ4">

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was relevant in looking for material for this debate. In the DCN issue of 27 February 1997, there is a heading `KAL makes Aust visa breakthrough'. KAL said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it will be able to issue visas for travellers bound for Australia beginning from April.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, in the public perception, what goes on here? A few weeks ago, we saw, vividly, news bulletin after TV news bulletin of two Koreans being bashed to death in a street in Sydney and then the subsequent reports that they were related to crime syndicates that had come in. The point I am making here is what price is protection and what price is domestic security when you continue to relax the supervision of the entry of tourists from abroad?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There again has to be a balance about the level of inspection and the level of examination. I do not hold a view that you should make it open slather, open door, let come in whoever wants to come in and then lament the problem that we have created. We have seen already numerous news reports about the Yakuza from Japan, now the Korean criminal gangs that are here and all the other ones we have heard referred to in the past. These more recent ones have to do with the increased flow of tourism. I think the industry itself and governments themselves, both federal and state, need to address this issue before it develops too far. It is a serious issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We looked at the industry as a whole, and where the industry is going. The airline business is a very tough business to be in. It is a very attractive business. So many operators think that if you paint `airlines' on the tail of your aircraft your fortune is made. All you have to do is collect the money and enjoy the wealth. I refer to another article which says that it is a cyclical industry that is highly sensitive to discretionary factors. There is no more a discretionary factor than in the case of charter aircraft, or unscheduled air services, as they are known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look to Europe, you will see that 1997 is the year&mdash;I think it is next month&mdash;when cabotage within the aviation industry ends, when any nation within the European Community will be able to transport people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2315"> by air to any other nation within the EC. It is going to be interesting to see how that works, because the EC has had a history of deliberately high domestic fares with travel into Europe being much cheaper than travel within Europe. When that develops, it will be interesting to see what the effect is going to be on the domestic cabotage rights within the 17 member states that constitute the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going on from that, I looked at a report prepared by the BTCE, report No. 86, and the section in that which deals with unscheduled services&mdash;`non-scheduled passenger traffic' is the jargon for it. It makes the point that, as we have known before, non-scheduled services, or charter services, provide a relatively small proportion of total revenue passenger kilometres, RPKs, or total traffic, across the world. In the 1992 figures, it was some 14.7 per cent of the total international revenue passenger kilometres, both scheduled and non-scheduled&mdash;that is all, less than 15 per cent of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The demand for that kind of traffic is highly discretionary. It is very price sensitive and it varies. It used to be the case that charter operators opened new markets and brought in a great deal of traffic. There was a very substantial margin between the scheduled fare level and what the charter operator could come in with, often with an older aircraft and often with a lower standard of accommodation in the aircraft&mdash;usually a higher passenger number, a closer configuration, less leg room and all those things that go to passenger comfort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that margin has greatly narrowed and there is not generally the margin of fat that used to be there for the unscheduled operator or the charter operator to come in underneath and siphon off traffic from the scheduled passenger operator. Again I raise the doubt about that. I can see chartered aircraft services as a way of opening up some new markets, but I do not think we should hold out a great deal of expectation about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to reinforce a point made by the shadow minister for transport, and that is that I do not want to see this country going into an open skies or blue skies policy&mdash;the love of so many people in the tourism industry. I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have a very strong view that airspace, our aviation market, is very much like minerals in the ground. It is a national resource. It is not something you give away. Yes, it has a potential. That potential expands with the quality of technology and transport available. But it is a national resource not to be handed out to other nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a concern with the way this government is going about handing out bilateral arrangements, it seems to me in many cases with little in return. We are so hasty, and you can see that reflected in the figures. We have 330,000 seats available out of Australia each week and only 200,000 of them are utilised; yet the minister refers to that as not an open skies policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go to the other extreme, you can look at non-scheduled service to the Middle East. What is said in respect of the Middle East? Most Third World countries and Middle East nations have tight restrictions regarding non-scheduled operations in order to protect their infant aviation industry. So there is this great mix of tight aviation policy, not so tight policy and in some cases I think overly liberal policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the point I started with. The two greatest markets in the world&mdash;the European Community and the United States of America&mdash;fiercely guard their aviation resource, their national aviation markets and the utilisation of those markets. If you look at where the growth is going to come from in the market, it is interesting to note that, looking across the United States, the Pacific and the international market generally, half of the revenue of all US airlines comes from trans&hyphen;Pacific operations&mdash;half of it. Compare that to what the minister had to say in his speech in November, that by the year 2000 the Asia&hyphen;Pacific will constitute 40 per cent of the world total of aviation traffic and aviation activity. Australia's share of that, as I said, is down to 42 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I understand and see how the minister has put the legislation forward, and I strongly support the amendments, I just want to sound those warnings that I have raised in respect of tourism and making it too easy for undesirable people and people with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2316"> criminal backgrounds to come into this country. There is the need to ensure that proper levels of safety and the safe operation of international aircraft are observed. CASA needs to have those resources and we need to ensure that people do have that proper protection and can utilise with confidence the services into and out of Australia, particularly in respect of the charter operations. I support the amendments foreshadowed by the shadow minister for transport.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997, I would first like to give a brief background on the intended sale process of the Perth, Melbourne and Brisbane airports. The sale of the long-term leases on federal airports will improve the efficiency of airport investments and operations while at the same time provide ordinary Australians, such as my constituents in the electorate of Swan, with the opportunity to invest in what is a very stable and profitable business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the enactment of the Airports Act 1996 in September of last year, expressions of interest were called for in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports. The probable selection of the successful bidder is expected in the next few months and finalisation of the sale of the leases shortly thereafter. The successful bidders may commence operation in the airports towards the end of June, but certainly will do so by the end of this parliamentary sitting or before we sit again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sydney will not be leased without a satisfactory solution to the noise problem from aircraft. In my opinion, that is a very sensible situation, given the heat surrounding Sydney. The government strategy of offering long&hyphen;term leases, coupled with the decision to break up a government owned monopoly airports network, is a world first and has attracted considerable international interest. It is providing significant opportunities for private sector involvement in infrastructure, with airports representing very attractive investments. This bill will provide certainty to new airport operators and existing airport tenants and will ensure the Commonwealth can exercise adequate regulatory control over the leased airports.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to reduce, if not eliminate, caveats being applied by the bidders to the payment of the sale proceeds to the Commonwealth, all essential elements of the regulatory apparatus need to be finalised forthwith. Amendments to the Airports Act 1996 will clarify some issues which are unclear and empower required regulations. These will include statutory requirements for an airport operator to use an airport site as an airport, this is a legal requirement to ensure that airport land is not redeveloped for other purposes; variable penalties for breaches of environmental standards; powers to allow pre-existing contamination to be addressed; and prohibition on sub&hyphen;leasing to trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides for some amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920, including the establishment of a register of unencumbered aircraft to provide buyers and sellers of aircraft with information on registered security interests held by lenders and creditors over aircraft including airframes, engines and avionics. This initiative is supported by the aviation industry. Other amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920 relate to the current approval process for charter flights. The amendment will strengthen consumer protection provisions and streamline and better identify charter approval processes consistent with the government's aviation policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Airports Act provides for the future operating regime of privatised airports for the next 99 years&mdash;50 years with a 49-year option. At this stage I wish to put the new owners of these airports on notice about their responsibilities and their obligations under their new ownership. The whole of Perth airport will now lie in my seat because of the redistribution of the seat of Swan, so I now wish to direct my comments to the Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> there was some speculation about who the new owners will be. It is understood that the bidders have been given until 10 April to submit their revised bids, with June now looming as the deadline for the sale, as I said earlier. John Fahey has stated that the government sales team has reviewed the bids against a range of criteria including price, diversity of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2317"> ownership objectives and airport management capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whoever ends up `owning/leasing' Perth airport needs to be aware of a number of obligations they will be required to adhere to. Because the airport will be in the hands of this new owner for some considerable time, I believe that the new Perth owners will need to develop a strategy like the good neighbour policy the current FAC management at Perth airport has in place. It is quite well known that up until a few years ago the Perth airport did not have a very satisfactory relationship with its neighbouring councils, some residents and the business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Approximately three years ago a group called RAGE, or Retailers Against Government Enterprise, was formed. It was one of the most successful lobby groups that were formed in relation to Perth airport. It was headed by Wally Daly, a local business proprietor, with the support of a well-known lobbyist from Western Australia called Bill Mitchell. Unfortunately, Mr Mitchell has since passed on. This group was successful in addressing what were major concerns in the development of Perth airport land by commercial enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At one stage it looked as though there would be a 20,000 square metre commercial development which would encroach on the local business community. There was so much contention in the Western Australian business community, especially the retail sector, that this group grew in stature and was able to attract the attention and the support of the Western Australian state government at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the considerations in this project included not only a huge commercial site but other developments which were regarded as being incompatible with the local environment. As a result of that, and possibly with the change of government, this large commercial development did not go ahead. In fact, it became such a contentious issue that the developers were unable to obtain local planning approval for this commercial development. I believe the then Minister for Planning in Western Australia, Mr Lewis, even threatened to cut off road supply to that part of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> airport if they did not have greater consensus with local councils in relation to planning approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the management of the now FAC chairman in Perth, Mr Graham Muir, there has been a far better conciliation process with local councils and local commercial interests. I believe that the new proposal now being considered involves 5,000 square metres of retail floor space rather than 20,000 square metres. Compatible developments around the Perth airport include a three&hyphen;star hotel. For those who do not know, Perth is absolutely bereft of hotel space at the moment. Perth hotels are continually booked out. I believe this will provide a great opportunity for compatible development on this land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There is also the possibility of a golf course being built in the local area, subject to environmental considerations. The Perth baseball community are currently looking for a home, and I suggest that they accept the proposal in the Ovens report, which was given many years ago to the Belmont City Council, of locating to the commercial area of Perth airport. It will not impact on residents as such because the beauty about Perth airport is that it has a huge buffer zone around the airport and is away from residential development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perth Glory, a very successful soccer team, is also looking for a home. As many people are aware, dual purpose stadiums are the way to go. The Perth Heat and the Perth Glory soccer team sharing a stadium might be a very good usage of airport land. This is to be considered by the new owners and the new planning process for the Perth airport precinct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is highly commendable that the government made sure that Perth was considered in the cross-ownership provisions and that Perth airport did not become an agency of Sydney.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the time I have left, I would like to again bring to this House's attention a number of issues that particularly affect the Perth airport and its surrounds. When I was finishing before I made it clear 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2318"> that I was very pleased that the Perth airport  was allowed to be out of the cross-ownership provisions. It will be a stand-alone purchase if that is the way it turns out and it will not become an appendage to the Sydney airport, where I had some grave concerns about its autonomy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to now refer to environmental considerations regarding the Perth airport and its surrounds. In doing so I would like to bring to the House's attention also that there is considerable concern by local environmentalists regarding the natural bushland that surrounds the Perth airport and the buffer zone there. I have visited that part of the airport with Senator Ian Campbell, Senator Dee Margetts, Joan Payne from the WA Conservation Council and Mr Kevin McLean from the local environmental group. We have looked at some significant areas of urban bushland, which is an important consideration in environment issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mundy Swamp is an example of a very good swamp. It is believed to have been the home of the very rare short-necked western tortoise. Unfortunately, they have not seen one for 23 years; however, it is believed that it may still be a good environment for them. What has caused the problem here is that those who designed and placed the new international terminal on the Perth airport placed it in such a way that, if there is to be a second parallel runway in many years to come, Mundy Swamp is under threat in terms of its existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this matter has been attended to in some respects because at one stage the Perth airport bushland was put on the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Council and the FAC challenged this listing on the basis of concerns that it had regarding this listing. This matter was arbitrated eventually before the court and the area now has been removed from the Register of the National Estate. But this does not mean to say that there are not very important considerations that need to be taken into account regarding the urban bushland and the wetland surrounding the Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again I put the new owners on notice that they have a great obligation in terms of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environmental considerations for the Perth airport buffer zone. This will include the commercial activity that may be allowed there eventually and such things as the golf course. As the local member, I can assure the community in general and the community that represents the environment groups that wherever I can I will help in terms of preserving the natural bushland and the wetlands around the Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some very concerning aspects regarding environmental measures related to the area surrounding the Perth airport. For example, right next to the Perth airport are the major marshalling yards for Western Australia. On the odd occasion there have been some major oil spills. In fact, I went and witnessed one of these oil spills where a large diesel tank ruptured into the subterranean surface and leaked thousands of litres of diesel into the subsoil. They had spears in the soil trying to suck the diesel out of the soil and save it from getting into the ground water. However, it was leaching into the wetlands and going through the main drain through the Perth airport and covertly being pumped off when it could be. So there are great considerations regarding some of the environmental matters surrounding the Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to make sure the House is aware that one of the great concerns at the moment is the fact that there are three overlapping native title claims on the Perth airport. In my opinion, there is a very good chance that some of these are not as genuine as they may first appear because there seem to be competing interests from three different groups who claim native title over the Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My advice is that where the airport has been developed&mdash;runways, buildings, et cetera&mdash;the title no longer exists. However, the parts of the airport that are considered to be urban bushland and remnant crown land are still subject to native title claims. This is why we need the government to make a decisive action regarding native title. I am sure it does not help the potential private owners of the Perth airport in their future 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2319"> ownership to have three overlapping native title claims on the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to mention a number of facts regarding the Perth airport. It grossed a profit in the 1995-96 year of $24 million. In the year before that it was $18 million. However, in 1988, when the FAC first took over, the Perth airport operated with a substantial loss. Since then there has been a 26 per cent annual growth and in the last three years profit levels have more than doubled. Most of this is non-aviation related. This is why there is great potential for the new owners to expand their commercial and developmental interests around the Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do warn the new owners that they may have a little problem trying to make it any more efficient than it is at the moment because Graham Muir, whom I mentioned earlier, under his urbane stewardship sees the FAC making sure the Perth airport is a very efficient operation. Mr Graham Muir would be an asset to any of the new owners as a manager not only because of his ability to manage the airport in an economic manner and make sure it turns a profit but because of the fact that he is a great consulter. As I have said previously, he has taken the airport from being a contentious issue to local business and local councils to being a harmonious working relationship. I can assure you that he has made the term `good neighbour policy' an effective one regarding the Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to make sure that the new owners understand their obligations and the protection that was given under the Airports Act 1996 regarding noise around the Perth airport. It is rather fatuous for the Labor Party to carry on about the noise around the Perth airport at the moment. They never, ever put money aside for noise studies regarding the Perth airport. They never did anything in a concrete way to help anybody who said that they had a noise problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All they have done since they have lost office is run around and stir up local action groups and tell them quite incredible mistruths regarding their entitlements and make people feel they have some sort of entitlement that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they actually do not have. This is seen around Sydney airport, and there are Labor members in Western Australia who certainly are trying to beat up this regarding the Perth airport. It is a shame that they would do this to the honest residents who live in areas surrounding the Perth airport, but that is not to say that the Perth airport does not have obligations regarding noise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The beauty about the Perth airport is that aircraft have to fly over areas of either uninhabited land or industrial land, except for one small section in South Guildford. As a result, the noise problem of the Perth airport is not as severe as anywhere else in Australia. I feel there are measures that can be taken to make sure that this is even further alleviated. As a member representing the people who live in areas surrounding the airport, I can guarantee those people that I will be acting on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perth airport is a tourism hub and an airport freight hub. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jet fresh: paddock to plate</EMPHASIS> gives the opportunity for a hub like Perth airport to enter into Asia in terms of air freight. That potential has not even been tapped yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of tourism, Western Australia is the gateway to Australia from the west, and it provides a tremendous opportunity for the marvellous tourist potential that Western Australia offers. We have a tourist potential in Western Australia, unlike anywhere else in Australia, that the rest of the world has not seen. Deregulated private ownership of the airport plus other aviation related measures will make sure that air travel is within the grasp of all Australians and far cheaper for international visitors. As a result, I want to see Perth airport deliver that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 is a step in the right direction for those of us involved in the industry. I am a pilot and owner-operator of a Cessna twin-engine aircraft and, as a parliamentarian, I am required to travel extensively throughout Australia on major airlines. So I understand the problems&mdash;not only as a pilot but also as a passenger&mdash;that the industry is currently having. I should add at this point that much of the problem is coming from the hierarchy in the industry. I am talking about the aviation board: a group of appointees&mdash;most of whom have little to no experience in aviation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people on the ground in the industry&mdash;and I am talking about the investigators or liaison officers in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia&mdash;know their job. They know what is required of them to put the industry right. On the other hand, the industry is immersed within a bureaucracy that feeds the board, for want of a better word, absolute rubbish. The information that the bureaucracy is currently handing on to the board puts them in a situation where they only act on that but, more often than not, the information that they are given is not what is actually required to get the best job done the first time. The problem then grows as the aviation board is short of knowledge in the field and is more often than not misled. They then intervene when they are not required to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, I believe every ship should have a captain to make the tough decisions and to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> give direction. But, seriously, you cannot tell me anyone in their right mind would appoint someone to captain a ship who has never touched the controls before. Likewise, those on the aviation board have no experience, no idea, no credibility and no leadership. They should not be there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point I must say that I expected, after being elected to the parliament, I could do more for the industry that means so much to me. But, alas, I am somewhat disappointed and frustrated&mdash;frustrated that we, the coalition government, have not yet been able to make the aviation industry more user-friendly, especially to the general aviation sector, although I will continue to drive for significant change with all the enthusiasm and resilience I have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is trying to take charge of this misguided group, the aviation board, and has put his best foot forward to fix the problem. So I say to the board: do you want to continue to be part of the problem or become part of the solution? To this end we have seen the public opinion that agrees the board must change more in line with the industry. Obviously now we see the group refuses to move despite the need for a safer industry. This direction will not happen while we have people who know nothing about the problems the industry is experiencing and continue to flounder against the need for change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the latest developments, the minister has moved to fix the problem only to come up against another brick wall. I talk of the obstructive Democrats in the Senate, in particular Senator Cheryl Kernot, another individual whose experience I would question in the field of aviation. This situation is precisely what I have been talking about in past addresses to the House with regard to knowledge of a topic or issue at hand. How can one profess to be representative of the people on any topic with no experience of the issue at hand? This is why the country is in trouble today. We have people making laws and changing legislation who have no knowledge of the topic. This brings me to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> by Bob Stone 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2321"> entitled `Kernot flies against public's wishes'. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently, Senator Cheryl Kernot stated she was not convinced that there was a need to change the board of the Civil Aviation Air Safety Authority.  What will convince her . . . a major air disaster? Whether she likes it or not, the electorate at large gave the coalition government a mandate to form a government, and as a government, it has a duty to look after the interests of all Australians, including their safety. I am afraid that the Democrats under Senator Kernot are nothing more than a bunch of egotistical obstructionists.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I rest my case. The amendments relating to international charter flights are an initiative that moves towards a more open and flexible international air charter market in Australia. The country city of Rockhampton in the electorate of Capricornia has an airport that has the capacity to handle overseas air charter flights for tourism and, even better, the ability to air freight food types to other countries. Runway 15&hyphen;33, which is currently running to plan with an extension to handle larger heavier aircraft, will fall right in line with this change of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Capricorn International Resort at Yeppoon, some 40 minutes drive from the airport, has looked forward to the day when they will be able to fly Japanese visitors direct to Rockhampton and then bring them to the resort. The extension to the runway and the new legislation make this event quite possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another of the amendments casts light on the sale of encumbered aircraft, the registration of security interests in relation to aircraft and their components. The register will enable the government to assist the industry with its economic viability by giving buyers and sellers of aircraft certainty of title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is envisaged that Airservices Australia will be responsible for the development and ongoing administration of the register, which will operate on a full cost recovery basis. This approach has been agreed to by the industry. The availability of this information on security interests held on aircraft and certain key components will be of particular benefit to the general aviation sector as this sector has been hit very heavily in the past by the economic 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> downturn which, in turn, increases the risk of exposure of undisclosed encumbrances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The register will protect the purchaser of an aircraft from buying a machine which has outstanding debt against it&mdash;and here I am talking about engines and engine components, airframes and internal equipment like avionics. This, I believe, will also assist in the tracking of bogus parts and/or the sale of second&hyphen;hand parts or components that are not up to scratch and subsequently fitted to aircraft which are not being caught by the system set up to safeguard against such occurrences. Too often, aircraft change hands with funds outstanding from the previous owner. In many cases, the aircraft has been sold because the owner could no longer afford to keep it, owing to the increases in maintenance costs, fuel hikes and landing fees. The cost to the owner/operator of aircraft these days is phenomenal and is only getting worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look to this government in the near future continuing to put good legislation forward that will decrease the cost to owner/operators and, therefore, stimulate the industry. People will then be able to afford the costs, thereby increasing the number of people involved in the industry and ultimately creating employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In years past, the previous Labor government has forced people out of aircraft. You do not have to look too far to see how many people have discarded their light aircraft to purchase ultralight planes&mdash;aircraft that do not require 100 per cent attention to maintenance in order for them to fly throughout the country. It is getting bad when people have to step away from the good old 172 that they might have used, say, in the electorate of the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) to check the fences and the water and, on the odd days, to zip into the local town to buy the weekly or monthly groceries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 is to provide certainty to new airport operators and existing airport tenants and to ensure that the Commonwealth can exercise adequate regulatory control over leased airports. The new subsection provides that an airport lessee company must not enter into an airport management agreement unless 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2322"> the agreement has been approved in writing by the minister. This will enable the Commonwealth to ensure that the public interest is not prejudiced by these agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In general, this initiative is to ensure that an airport is used for the purpose as defined of  aviation. With this in mind, many airports throughout the country have been sold off by the Commonwealth. This, once again, was another great milestone of the Australian Labor Party. They sold everything and now whinge that the coalition is selling off the country. Talk about hypocritical!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Local government or the shire councils currently have most of the airports. In some cases a company or group could take ownership of one in a certain area and, if the airport were failing to cover its costs, the lessee may attempt to use the airport for another purpose, thereby obstructing the main task that is expected at that field, which must be aviation&mdash;the ability for aircraft to frequent the strip as required in accordance with the regulations. I commend the amendments to the House. The amendments are needed and are industry supported.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very grateful for the opportunity to be able to speak about environmental matters on the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 because this is the central focus of the proposed amendments. Specifically, we are including some new provisions in relation to variable penalties for breaches of environmental standards, providing new offences for deliberate harm to the environment, providing powers to allow pre&hyphen;existing contamination to be addressed and requiring airport lessees to seek public comment prior to submitting minor variations of master plans and major development plans to the minister for approval.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environment and aviation go hand in hand. Aviation, particularly in our modern cities and particularly in Sydney, relies significantly on the cooperation of the general public and on a harmonious relationship with the environment. That certainly has come into question over the last few years. Of course, we think only too often of the impact of the construction of Sydney's third runway, as it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> became known, on the environment and on the Sydney community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should never for a second underestimate the importance of Kingsford Smith airport to the people of Sydney and to the Sydney basin. It has been there since 1919. More than 50 per cent of all international flights into Australia come into Kingsford Smith airport, and Kingsford Smith airport also handles over one&hyphen;third of all domestic passengers. So, apart from having the massive infrastructure there that employs over 60,000 people and provides ongoing employment and further employment to a number of related industries and a large number of people, the airport is also the tourism and traffic hub of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forecasts suggest there will be an annual increase of 4.1 per cent of aircraft movements until the year 2000, and it is fair to assume that that growth will continue in the aftermath of the Sydney 2000 Olympics. According to the Department of Transport, in 1995&hyphen;96 Kingsford Smith airport had 270,000 movements. This will increase to 316,500 movements in 1999&hyphen;2000. Of those, 55,000 movements will be international, 235,000 will be domestic and 26,500 will be non&hyphen;scheduled aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is a wonderful opportunity to go through some of the events that have occurred during the last few years, particularly in relation to the environmental management of Kingsford Smith airport. The most significant event was the opening of the third runway on 4 November 1994. It is a date that is indelibly marked on the minds of the people of Sydney. Within weeks the community's anger was palpable, culminating in a massive public rally held at Leichhardt Oval on 3 December 1994. Soon to follow, on 17 December, was a blockade of Sydney airport&mdash;an unprecedented event. Community anger was centred around the fact that the environmental impact statement associated with the construction of the third runway was proven to be misleading within days of the opening of the third runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP government on 20 December 1994 put in place the northern flight corridors. We all remember it: Paul Keating and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2323"> Laurie Brereton standing in front of a massive map of the Sydney basin saying, `We are going to shovel the planes up this narrow flight corridor.' That corridor became known as the Bennelong funnel. The funnel was, in effect, the most obvious example of the very base politics that the Australian Labor Party em ployed in relation to the airport. The problem became very significant in a very short time for over 200,000 Sydney residents who were receiving over 55 per cent of all traffic to the north of the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reaction to the ALP's obvious disregard for the welfare of residents resulted in a second blockade at Sydney airport, this time at the domestic terminal, on 13 February 1995. The coalition was very aware of this anger because the coalition had been aware of the great dispute within the Australian Labor Party during the debate about whether a third runway should be constructed at Sydney airport or whether a second international airport should be constructed in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a fair man. I will recognise that credit should be given where it is due. The current member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) is recorded as saying that he was opposed to the construction of a third runway at Kingsford Smith airport. I think it is important at this juncture to refer to what became known as the bible of the Hawke&hyphen;Keating years. I would like to quote from that bible. It is the Bantam publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whatever It Takes</EMPHASIS>, written by that authoritative source, Graham Richardson. Let me take you, Mr Deputy Speaker, into the politics, according to this authoritative source, of the debate about the construction of the third runway. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two Labor held seats were in danger over the decision to build the runway. To be realistic, probably only one, St George, held by Steve Dubois&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not remember him; he is certainly not here these days&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had a big enough majority to survive. But Gary Punch's Barton stood out as a real electoral casualty. I worried about this. With a worsening economy and interest rates going ever higher, I do not apologise for being concerned with issues of electoral wisdom.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here comes the clanger:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, Keating, Leo McLeay and Peter Baldwin, among others, considered the problem of threatened seats only one of several factors. Their electoral bases were safe.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is Graham Richardson saying that Leo McLeay and Peter Baldwin, two people who have had a keen interest in the ramifications of the construction of the third runway on their electorates, thought it was okay: `We have got a big enough margin; we do not have to worry about too many people in our electorates.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Isn't that a sad indictment of the attitude of the Australian Labor Party? That is why they are in opposition today. It is that sort of pervading attitude&mdash;`My margin is big enough; I do not have to worry about it'&mdash;that put them there. I remember how during the six public meetings, which I will touch on a little later, the current member for Watson was standing in front of about 1,500 people in the Marrickville Town Hall professing his support for their concern about the ramifications of the construction of Sydney's third runway. I quote to the member for Watson what his own mate, the man who wrote the bible about the Hawke-Keating years, said.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am happy to talk about the environmental ramifications of the aviation proposals before us. The most significant outcome of the election campaign was the policy of the coalition in the lead-up to 2 March election. That policy, Putting People First, indeed did just that&mdash;it put people first. What we said was that we were going to put the people of Sydney first when it came to discussions about the environmental impact of the operations of Kingsford Smith airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That policy manifests itself today in what has become known as the long-term operating plan for Kingsford Smith airport. This plan, put together by the industry, the various community groups, Airservices Australia, the Department of Transport and all the various interested parties, offers a total solution for the problems immediately associated with Kingsford Smith airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we promised in January and February of 1996 was that we were going to spread the noise around, that Sydney airport could cope with the demands, which I have talked about a little earlier, of the 21st century. What we wanted to do was put in place a comprehensive system that introduced new modes of operation at Kingsford Smith airport, was able to share the noise around and, at the same time, was going to address the concerns of specifically the people who suffered under the Bennelong funnel&mdash;the Bennelong funnel that people like the member for Watson said was okay for their electorates because they had a significant enough majority to cope with some of the dissent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They significantly underestimated the dissent in the community. That dissent has come to the fore in two ways. Firstly, it was a direct part of the development of the coalition's policy. Secondly, the concern of the Sydney community is directly conveyed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the minister today through the Sydney Airport Community Forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community forum, which I am fortunate enough to chair, has representatives from the Australian Labor Party, including the members for Grayndler and Barton (Mr McClelland), the state members for Heffron, Diedre Grusovin, and Lane Cove, Kerry Chikarovski, and a number of mayors. Most of those mayors are not obvious supporters of the coalition, including the Marrickville mayor, who is obviously not a supporter of the coalition. That group has come together to have some important feed into the decision making process at Kingsford Smith airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a part of this plan, over 1,500 submissions were received from the general public, including representative groups. We also held six public meetings. Most of the public meetings were held in Labor Party seats. What I find most interesting is that the public meetings held in Labor Party seats, such as in the town hall at Marrickville&mdash;the members for Grayndler and Watson are party to this&mdash;attracted about 2,000 people. In total, about 6,000 people attended the public meetings and had some feed into the long&hyphen;term operating plan. The net result is that the plan is being considered further by the Commonwealth government. I urge the minister for transport to adopt the plan. I urge the government to fully support its implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The beneficiaries of the plan, which benefits the Sydney community significantly, are mostly the people immediately to the north of the airport. It is not just the people in my electorate of North Sydney who benefit and it is not just the people in the electorates of Bradfield and Bennelong who benefit. People in the electorates of Grayndler and Watson are also the big beneficiaries of this plan.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did in the member for Lowe; it would not surprise me. He tried to claim credit for it anyway, even if he did not. I actually rose tonight not to speak about the third runway but to respond to some other comments that were made in the debate earlier tonight. My colleague the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) made a number of remarks that have resulted in my seeking the call to make a few comments in support of the Australian tourism industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But before I get on to that I would remind the House that in my maiden speech I said that the honourable member for Shortland was the greatest Minister for Transport Australia had had since the war. The point I would like to make is that, when I first arrived in the Australian parliament, Peter Morris, the member for Shortland, was the acknowledged expert on transport matters. He displayed in his contribution earlier tonight that he continues to be extremely well informed and remains up to date in many ways about the issues that are before the parliament tonight and that affect aviation. He has always been a strong advocate for making sure that Australia's interests are protected in aviation and shipping, and other matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just take up a few of the issues that the member for Shortland raised in the debate. He quite rightly pointed out that in the past, when Australia was negotiating airline agreements, we often used to adopt positions based on what we thought was best for the Australian airline&mdash;in practice, what we thought was best for Qantas, which was then the only international airline owned by Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some years ago, during the time of the former Labor government, the philosophy changed so that we were looking at what would be the best position to advance the economic interests of Australia. That certainly is the way we should be going now, especially with the Australian tourism industry having grown dramatically in the last decade. If we want to make sure that we maximise not just the foreign exchange earnings for Australia but also the number of jobs that we create in Australia, we need to balance what is in the interests not just of the Australian owned airlines but also of creating jobs and investment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that there have been discussions between the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), and the minister for transport about ways in which we can seek to improve the current proposal which is before the House to make sure that we do get a proper consideration and proper analysis of how we can estimate those benefits for Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2328">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a bit of debate about charters and whether we should be making it easier for air charters to bring more tourists to Australia. During my time as Minister for Tourism in the last government, there were a number of examples of where charters had been able to grow and expand potential markets for the Australian tourism industry. In particular, I think there were a number of flights from Singapore to regional areas that really blazed the trail for increasing tourism from a number of countries in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, I think the British market to a large extent still depends on large numbers of charter flights each year, despite the large number of scheduled flights between Britain  and Australia. If we did not have those charter flights from Britain, despite the relatively large number of them, I think the Australian tourism industry would probably be receiving fewer English tourists and in many ways probably fewer English backpackers. However, despite what people have thought in the past, backpackers often are the ones who stay the longest and spend the most during their extended stay in Australia. I know that people on both sides of House probably would prefer to see more scheduled flights. But, if we can use charters to advance the economic interests of Australia, that is something which should be welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Shortland also said that we should be trying to address this issue which often gets raised of how much economic benefit flows to Australia if you have people flying on overseas owned, foreign owned, airlines, staying at foreign owned hotels, allegedly shopping at foreign owned duty-free stores. This issue often gets raised in the tourism industry, and people ask how much of the money stays in Australia, especially if the airfares are prepaid overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, there have been a number of studies on this issue. They have all concluded that up to 80 per cent or so of the land component of these overseas holidays stays in Australia. If you stay at a hotel, no matter who owns it, someone has to provide the food that is served there and local staff are employed there in the hotel to provide the services. No matter who owns the hotel, it is not just a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matter of cooking hamburgers and making beds; there are jobs in management and careers paths for young Australians, in particular, to advance and make their way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Shortland also raised a very important issue about the calls by some people, including my old friend Bruce Baird from the Tourism Council of Australia, for the abolition of visas or the identification of perhaps a dozen or so countries for which visas should be abolished. The member for Shortland quite rightly raised the concerns that will follow if we do abolish visas for some countries. He is not the first person to raise in this House concerns about what happens if you allow visa&hyphen;free entry from Japan and other countries. There have been lots of stories in the paper about the Yakuza and other crime syndicates&mdash;not just those involving Japanese citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that a number of members on the government side of the House have also expressed strong concerns in the past about making sure that visa checks remain very thorough and we make sure that people of poor character or who are involved in organised crime, drug trafficking or other unsavoury activities are prevented from coming to Australia. I have always thought that some people in the tourism industry, including Mr Baird, exaggerate the impact that visas have on tourism to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seem to recall a study once which claimed that billions of dollars in foreign exchange earnings were lost because we required people from other countries to have visas. When you went back to the raw data of the survey, you found that it was 80 people who happened to be accosted as they arrived in Australia. The amount of rigour which that survey entailed would lead me to question the validity of some of the conclusions that were made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the department of immigration has been working for a number of years on the introduction of electronic visas. If the department is still able to meet its targets, that will go a long way towards making it easier for international visitors to travel to Australia because they will not have to send their passports away. It will allow people to get 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2329"> their visas more easily and more quickly without having the inconvenience, but it will also ensure that those character checks are still carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A comment was made about the number of seats available for flights into and out of Australia&mdash;that is, about 330,000 per year. People have commented that only 200,000 of those available seats are actually utilised. I think we have to be careful not to exaggerate the impact or the meaning that might be read into that. A number of airlines who have the right to fly to Australia do not. A number of airlines do not use their full capacity. Let us look at the number of flights that have been agreed between Australia and Korea, or Australia and Taiwan or Australia and Indo nesia. As the tourism flows have grown, Australia has, through negotiations, agreed to increase the number of flights per week from those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has certainly led to a significant boost to the Australian tourism industry because the airlines then have a vested interest in filling their seats and in making sure that more tourists from their country come to Australia on holidays. This is not to deny the comments made by the member for Shortland that the United States and the European Union are fiercely aggressive in defending their airline rights. I think we have to apply the test that I mentioned earlier of working out the best way to develop the most economic benefit to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simply because some other countries have anti-competitive practices does not mean that we should automatically make the same mistakes as them. If we liberalise air service agreements from other countries to Australia, the test will be whether that delivers increases in the number of tourists coming to Australia or whether that delivers extra foreign exchange earnings, especially if our airlines are slightly less worse off. We have to work out on that balance sheet whether or not there is an economic benefit to Australia. That is the way to do it. I am sure all those who hold out hope that there are extra jobs in the Australian economy as a result of the tourism industry want to make sure that we get that balance right.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate that the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) scuttled out of the chamber before the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and I made our contributions. As the member for North Sydney knows, by bringing into the debate the canards that he did, he has opened up the debate to a number of areas which the government probably would not feel all that comfortable about. The Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 before the House tonight is about the environmental impacts of the use of airports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) said in his second reading speech that he and the government `want to include offences for deliberately causing environmental harm'. He also said that the environmental protection regulations `will establish a regime to identify and manage any pollution or sources of pollution at the leased airport sites'. Everyone knows that the greatest form of pollution at any of the airports around Australia, most particularly at Sydney airport, is noise pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the people living in western suburbs know that the person responsible for noise pollution around their homes is the member for North Sydney. He has done a sleazy deal in collusion with the minister for transport. The government made an election pledge to move a problem that the Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), had&mdash;that is, the noise over the poor little people in his electorate&mdash;and spread it over everyone else. This was the most wicked example of self&hyphen;interest that anyone has seen here in a long day's march.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Bennelong said, `It is really shocking that the millionaires who live in Hunters Hill'&mdash;who are the ones in the aeroplanes&mdash;`have to put up with the noise caused by their neighbours in these aeroplanes. We will get the member for North Sydney to set up this committee and move the noise into someone else's electorate.' The government attempted to buy the last election. As I outlined in the MPI today, another electoral bribe put forward by the government was the Prime Minister saying that you could trust him on health. This is another one of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2330"> those electoral bribes. The Prime Minister has said that you can trust him on airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He told the gullible electors in Lowe that they could trust him; that the government would remove noise pollution from the electorate of Lowe. The people of Lowe might be able to have a go at the government because the government said that they want to include offences for deliberately causing environmental harm. The Prime Minister promised that there would be no aeroplanes flying over the electorate of Lowe. The people in the electorate of Lowe have a credibility problem because they wake up every morning to these aeroplanes when the Prime Minister told them that there would be no planes flying over Lowe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for North Sydney gave the game away five minutes ago. He said that the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) could speak for himself. The truth is that the government has cut the member for Lowe adrift. He is dispensable now. The government has a big majority; it does not care about the member for Lowe. Poor old Paul Zammit has members of the Liberal Party in the Lebanese community wanting to do him in. He has members of the Liberal Party in the Greek community wanting to do him in, and now he has the member for North Sydney wanting to do him in because he does not matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have got to organise this noise pollution and environmental harm in a way that suits them. The way that suits them is to get the planes out of the member for Bennelong's electorate because he is the Prime Minister and you cannot upset his constituents, for goodness sake, and we have got to get the planes out of the member for North Sydney's electorate because he is the chairman of the Sydney airport noise abatement committee or whatever it is called now. He cannot have any noise, because there is no point in appointing him to this most important committee if he cannot get the planes out of his electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the poor old member for Lowe has just got to sit there and cop it and the planes will zoom down Jet Alley, down there through Dobroyd Point and over there through Ashfield. They will all zoom through the member 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for Lowe's electorate and when the poor member for Lowe's voters wake up every morning they will think, `But hang on, we remember the last election and we remember the Prime Minister coming out here and saying that we won't have to worry about environmental harm'&mdash;and this bill does talk about environmental harm&mdash;`and we won't have to worry about offences for deliberately causing environmental harm; we won't have to worry about the noise.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They voted for the member for Lowe as a result of that, but what do they find now? They find that the member for North Sydney and the government have cut him adrift. They have said: `Paul Zammit? Well, he's expendable. We'll just let those planes rip up there through Jet Alley so that the Prime Minister and the good old member for North Sydney, who is chairman of the noise committee for the government, are protected.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for North Sydney has got the hide to come in here tonight and try to impute motive to people on this side. The problem the member for North Sydney has is that the rotten government that he is part of and the predecessors of this rotten government have been trying to do their damnedest to build up Sydney airport since the seventies, since the days of Malcolm Fraser and his major airport needs of Sydney expansion program. The people around Sydney beat that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have the current government saying that they have this little bill here tonight in which they want to include offences for deliberately causing environmental harm and they want to establish a regime to identify and manage. That interesting word `manage' is in the second reading speech on the top line of page 2, but it is in inverted commas. So what does `manage' mean? What they mean by managing air pollution and noise pollution is that they manage it into someone else's electorate. They manage it into the electorates of my colleague the member for Grayndler and my electorate, but they manage it out of the electorates of the member for North Sydney and the member for Bennelong. That is what they mean by `manage' and that is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2331"> why, in my view, `manage' is there in inverted commas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, you have the other person who has been sacrificed on their altar of airport expediency. That is the poor old member for Hughes (Mrs Vale). The poor old member for Hughes literally came in here on a wing and a prayer and she has been doing a bit more praying than winging lately. Her problem is that she has got in here as a member of the government. The people of Hughes ought to really pray for the member for Hughes because she has been terrific for them. Since she got here the government has given her a nuclear reprocessing plant in her backyard and it is now about to give her a 24&hyphen;hour operation airport. The contagious diseases hospital and the locust plague will be along next week. That is what the member for Hughes has been given. So she has been cut adrift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lowe has also been cut adrift. The poor old member for Hughes and the poor old member for Lowe are  sort of just dopes in the old Liberal Party regime. They got in here but, unfortunately, they were not supposed to get in here, I don't think.</PARA>

But the member for Bennelong and the member for North Sydney and the old mad monk over here are part of the ascendancy, they are part of the Liberal Party royalty, and they have got to be protected at all costs. So they have these arrangements whereby they dump into poor old Danna's backyard an airport that will run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But they never told anyone about it before the election&mdash;they never mentioned a word about it. As for the member for Lowe and the poor old election promise they made to him, that mustn't have been a core promise because it is now not a promise.

I think that the slur he cast on the member for North Sydney&mdash;he suggested that he had been drinking before he came into this chamber&mdash;is disgraceful. Maybe he might want to withdraw that, because that is what he was saying. You can't be too smarty pants and come in here and get funny. Maybe you have hoisted yourself on your own petard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are involved in this filthy, corrupt, sleazy deal to cut loose the poor old member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) and to make him dispensable just so that the Liberal Party royalty over there on the North Shore, of which the parliamentary secretary at the table

Yet they are out there causing the most massive environmental harm to the inner suburbs of Sydney and getting away with it!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have gone out there and told lies to the people in that part of Sydney. They have let the poor member for Lowe go out there and say to people, `You can trust the Prime Minister. He won't let you down.' They have let the member for Hughes go out there and say, `You can trust the government but, by the way, after the election there is an airport in your backyard.' As well, the poor woman gets a nuclear reprocessing plant. I suppose that is probably going to be a beacon for the planes because they will all be lighting up of a night.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on this issue tonight because it is important that the inner west be represented in this debate on the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill. The member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) certainly will not be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2334"> speaking in this debate, because the member for Lowe is cowering and running from anything to do with Sydney airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased also because this bill is in part about charter flights. It is interesting that the issue of charter flights comes up, because back on 6 November 1996 I asked a question of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp)&mdash;question No. 927 on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>&mdash;about an Evergreen Airlines flight over my electorate of Grayndler on 15 October 1996. I asked that question because I had a number of representations from dozens of residents who saw fuel being dumped over their homes, over their schools, over their clothes, over their cars, over their suburbs&mdash;carcinogens being dumped on their heads where they live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that it took the minister for transport five months to give a response. Eventually I did get a response about this Evergreen Airlines flight. The response that I got is quite astonishing. It appears that it was a flight chartered from Qantas&mdash;a B747&hyphen; 200 departing to the north, the favoured mode of operation under the long-term operating plan. That aircraft departed, on its way to Hong Kong, with 240,300 pounds or 35,865 US gallons of fuel. And what happened? I will read you the minister's response. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is reported that the aircraft released fuel from take-off to Russell Lea&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">in the electorate of Lowe&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a distance of about 10 kilometres.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For 10 kilometres fuel was dumped on the residents of Sydney and on their homes&mdash;carcinogens: poisonous, damaging to their health, damaging to their houses and damaging to our environment. It appears that Airservices Australia wrote to the operator, Evergreen International, requesting that an inspection take place and that any fault be quickly rectified. The matter was also taken up with Qantas, given that they were the charterer of the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is extraordinary is that the investigation found that there were five&mdash;not one, not two, not three, not four, but five&mdash;broken vent valves in the wing tanks. There were five 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tanks pouring out carcinogens on my electorate. What is the response from the minister? To sit on this matter for five months; to not give an answer to the residents of the inner western suburbs of Sydney; to not give an answer to me as the member for Grayndler; to not give an answer to the discredited member of the extreme right of the Liberal Party, the member for Lowe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It went even further. The minister also replied to my question of how many similar incidents have occurred since November 1995. You might have expected the courtesy of a detailed response: `Yes, and these were the details.' But what I got was simply a one-liner: `Three similar alleged incidents have occurred.' We are talking about 10 kilometres of fuel dumping on the heads of residents of Sydney, and on three other occasions similar incidents have occurred. Today I have put questions on notice to the minister asking exactly what those incidents were, because residents have a right to know when carcinogens are being dumped on their families, homes and schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's response to solving the problem is pathetic. He has hit them with a feather. You would expect some sort of penalty&mdash;a financial impost, the banning of the particular aircraft, some action which says to these airlines that the government actually thinks this is not on and that the government actually cares about the residents of Grayndler and the residents of Lowe. Perhaps if the fuel had kept coming out and had gone on to the residents of Hunters Hill we would have had some action. But what we see from this government is, `If it ain't over the North Shore, it doesn't matter.' The minister's pathetic response just says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should any future incidents occur, the issue will again be raised with the operator as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Oh dear me! Airlines dumping fuel over residents and, if it occurs again, it will just be raised with the operator as a matter of urgency: `We'll pick up the phone. We won't take any action, but we will raise it.' I am sure that the multimillion dollar airline industry will be quaking in their boots at such decisive action from the minister!</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2335">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) has tonight raised the issue of Sydney airport and prattled on about the great job being done by the Sydney Airport Community Forum. I am proud to be a member of the Sydney Airport Community Forum and I think that some of the work it has done has been very valuable. But I have to say this: what is the value of this North Shore Hockey club when we are not told about incidents such as this; when we are not told about the proposal to move the third runway threshold; when we are not told about the Rockdale proposal to build a Darling Harbour type development; when we are not told about the $800 million expansion for the Olympics&mdash;we read that on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> yesterday&mdash;and when we are not told about the incompetent mismanagement and mistakes in the long-term operating plan that has been released? Now we are not told about jets dumping barrels of fuel on the most densely populated area in Australia. That is pretty consistent with the lack of action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We still see from this government no legislative cap on Sydney airport, we still see no second airport for Sydney, we still see no real noise relief for residents around Sydney airport and we still see chaos at that airport. In this House during the last fortnight I asked the minister whether he was still committed to a legislative cap and, if so, when he would introduce it. I was told `soon'. The government have a whole department at their disposal. They have advisers over there&mdash;boxes of them. The other side of the House is full of these spivs who have now moved away from the airport flight paths. They used to live under them but they have moved away from there to get away from the noise. They moved away from Leichhardt because they did not like it and because they knew that this minister would not solve the problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But why the delay when the minister has a whole department at his disposal? Even I, a newly elected backbench opposition member, could get together a bill. I got a bill together and introduced it into this House. It was seconded by the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), who tonight gave 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an eloquent exposition of why he opposes the chaos at Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why the delay? Look at the Liberal policy of 29 January 1996 called `Putting people first'. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will cap aircraft movements at 80 movements per hour . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the then opposition policy that was launched by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the electorate of Lowe. It counts for nothing. We then had a press release from John Howard on 8 February 1996&mdash;that is, last year; not this year&mdash;which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will cap aircraft movements at the current capacity of 80 movements per hour.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, nothing happened. So I put together a bill, which had its first reading on 4 November and its second reading on 18 November. On 18 November 1996 the minister released a media statement headed `Sydney airport aircraft movements cap to be legislated'. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will introduce its own legislation to enshrine the 80 movements cap.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, nothing happened. The minister actually said in that press release that substantial work had already been done on this. Substantial work has supposedly been done, but five months later nothing has happened. In the House Paul Zammit, the discredited member of the extreme Right of the New South Wales Liberal Party and whom the Left, including the member for North Sydney, and the John Howard faction, including the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott)&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lowe, Mr Zammit, said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 18 November 1996, `It will occur early in 1997.' Define `early'. It is now towards the end of March. He is the holder of a marginal seat north of the airport but the

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to the long&hyphen;term operating plan. It is an interesting plan. There they show their real contempt for the member for Lowe. The long-term operating plan lists suburbs and the impacts on the residents of Sydney. The only problem is they left out 30,000 people. The postcodes for Haberfield and Five Dock&mdash;2045 and 2046&mdash;are just not there. Maybe if we leave the people out they will not be affected.</PARA>

The residents of Haberfield and Five Dock must be seeing things, they must be hallucinating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the maps we see how far the dishonesty goes. Maps 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 10  are all wrong. Mode 3 says `Departures&mdash;runway 16 left; arrivals&mdash;runway 34 left.' We all know that at Sydney airport long&hyphen;haul jets effectively have to depart to the north, but they do not appear in the maps. Mode 5 says `Long haul jet arrivals&mdash;16 right', but the maps which purport to tell residents where the planes will go over their heads have no lines on them. They are silent. They are like the Thunderbirds, like invisible, fast&hyphen;moving aircraft that do not make any noise which affects residents to the north of the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is extraordinarily dishonest. It is about as dishonest as the coalition's promise that Lowe will not be affected in the future&mdash;a direct promise by the Prime Minister. Well, Lowe does not have one flight path. It has four. The reason why it has take&hyphen;offs to the north rather than landings from the north is that, if planes are to be landed from the north, they have to be brought in in a straighter line and they would have to come in over the electorate of Bennelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is about putting the noise anywhere but Bennelong. That is the real 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> philosophy behind this government. It thinks that hearing is related to income; it thinks that the richer you are, the more sensitive your hearing is. So it is okay to put the planes over Marrickville and Sydenham because that is where the poor people are. `We'll dump on them just as we'll dump fuel all over their heads and not even bother to let them know.' They just dump on them because they certainly are not a priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you compare the delay in introducing a legislated cap at Sydney airport with the urgency that this minister has shown in replacing the CASA board or with spending money on the PADS system, then I think it stands in stark contrast. Maybe we should have done some sort of an exhibition in the corridor on the flight paths. Maybe then we would get some action. Maybe we could build a few lightweight houses in the corridor of the ministerial wing, and then we could get some action on their voluntary acquisition.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this we see on the one hand decisive action to get planes away from Bennelong and delay on all other fronts. We see a second Sydney airport delayed. We have got this madcap Holsworthy proposal. We see no action from this government on a second airport. I must say that, when I introduced the cap bill, I predicted this prevarication from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2337"> the mob on the other side. I actually said at the time that there was no timetable for the introduction of a cap at Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There still is no timetable. Last week I got in my office a list of bills being put forward in the next session. Again it just does not appear. It is not there. You are not going to do it. The government simply has a policy of expansion at Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am surprised because there has been substantial community support for my bill, including from the council at North Sydney which unanimously supports the Albanese bill. The council at Lane Cove unanimously supports the Albanese bill. The councils at Hunters Hill, Marrickville, Botany Bay, Kogarah, Rockdale, Leichhardt, South Sydney, Ryde and Hurstville all support the Albanese-McLeay private member's bill to limit capacity at Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what you see on the one hand is opposition members ensuring that some real action is taken on Sydney airport. On the other hand you see a continued expansion of the facilities at that airport. We have been told by Airservices Australia that modes nine and 10  in the long-term operating plan allow for up 120 movements per hour, so we know that that is the case. You can put that together with the attempt to change the threshold of the third runway, again to expand the capacity at Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that the minister has responded to the pressure from the Sydney Airport Community Forum&mdash;I might say in a motion moved by myself, the Labor member for Grayndler, at that forum. It was pretty clear what the numbers were if it came to a vote on that. The member for North Sydney can count. He had his instructions from the minister, but he could count so he had to tell the minister, `Sorry, Johnny. We didn't have the numbers on this one, so we have to back away,' and the government has backed away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see in the meantime is no action on the second Sydney airport, expansion at Rockdale, exchanging the threshold, bringing in modes which allow for up to 120 movements per hour, a preference for take&hyphen;offs to the north rather than landings from the north

<PARA STYLE="Para">By way of brief explanation to the House, amendment No. 2, which now lapses, was conditional upon amendment No. 1 being passed. Amendment No. 1 has been defeated. Therefore, amendment No. 2 is no longer applicable. We now move to amendment No. 3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The net effect of amendment No. 3 is that the criteria which apply, with respect to the  secretary to the department granting an approval for a foreign charter operation to come to Australia, will also apply when the secretary exercises his power under this legislation to exempt a particular charter operation from needing to get approval for that operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision in the legislation has been indicated by the government to be there to provide for certain specific situations where there may be a once&hyphen;only charter. From time to time circumstances may prevail where there is a need for a particular charter, and to have to go through the bureaucratic approval process may be unduly onerous and may be relatively unnecessary. The opposition does not contest the logic of that position on the part of the government but is concerned at the breadth of the provision as it stands at the moment, which empowers the secretary to the department to give an exemption from the requirement to obtain approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition feels that the simplest way to get around this problem is to require that, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in granting any exemption from a requirement to give approval, the secretary is required to give consideration to the same factors that he is required to give consideration to in granting an approval. That way, there is an evenness between the two sets of criteria: whether the secretary is making a decision by saying, `Yes, you can have approval to run a charter operation from your country to Australia,' and vice versa, or whether the secretary is saying, `Yes, you are exempted from even having to seek that approval,' that he has to think of the various issues that are set out in the legislation in both cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that is the purpose of the amendment. Once again, I understand that the government, although it will vote against the amendment in the House, will give further consideration to this matter and that we may be able to reach some common view by the time the matter gets to the Senate. On that basis, the opposition will not proceed to divide on this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997 is an anti&hyphen;export bill, an anti&hyphen;export measure. It is bad policy. It is bad for jobs. It is bad for exports. It is bad for Australian exporters. It is bad for the development of an export culture. It is bad for our balance of payments. It is bad for economic growth. But it should come as no surprise to this House because this is consistent with what the government has been doing in the trade and industry policy area since it came to office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill reflects and implements substantial changes announced in the budget on 20 August 1996. What the government is proposing to do with the Export Market Development Grants Bill is consistent with what it has  been doing in a range of industry and trade enhancement measures&mdash;very many of which have been contrary to government election commitments. If it is not the gutting and the narrowing of the export market development grants scheme, if it is not the adverse export and trade consequences of the government's ramshackle handling of the DIFF scheme, if it is not a $2 billion cut to research and development, it is the abolition of bounties such as the shipbuilding bounty in an industry which is now exclusively exporting. That is the government's general approach to trade and industry enhancement measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Export enhancement is one of the very important legs of trade policy. The opposition's position and response to the government's bills&mdash;these two measures, the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997 and the transitional bill, the Export Market Development Grants (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Bill&mdash;is reflected by a second reading amendment which I am happy to have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> circulated in my name. To reflect the opposition's detailed concerns in respect of these particular bills, detailed amendments will be pursued in the consideration in detail stage. I am happy to have those amendments circulated at the conclusion of my remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading amendment and the consideration in detail amendments reflect the opposition's approach to these particular measures. The opposition's parliamentary response to these measures has been threefold: the second reading amendment, which I will formally move at the conclusion of my remarks; the amendments at the consideration in detail stage, which I have referred to; and action by the opposition in the Senate to ensure that these bills were referred to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. Consistent with the Senate standing orders, on the introduction of the legislation to this House, the bill in the Senate was the subject of a reference to and public hearing by that committee. That public hearing was conducted on Monday of this week with a resolution of the Senate that the committee report by Friday of this week. Coincidentally, with the passage of the legislation through this House, we will find the Senate exploring the adverse implications of this legislation to Australian exporters by way of its relevant legislation committee. The opposition reserves its right to move further amendments in the Senate, dependent upon the detailed consideration of that public hearing and the evidence given yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some items of the legislation which the opposition has no difficulty with. Some of those go to the full extension of the scheme to tourism providers. That has been the subject of a number of reports by various committees of this House&mdash;in particular, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration and the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. From memory, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) was a member of the relevant industry committee and was one of the signatories to a report with a recommendation to that effect. The full extension of the scheme to tourism providers 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2341"> is supported and welcomed by this side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction of the eligible threshold limit from $30,000 to $20,000 is also supported. The restriction of the scheme to firms with a turnover of no more than $50 million per annum is also supported, as is the upper limit of $25 million in export earnings. A couple of minor measures are also supported, including the three per cent calculation for communication costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is strongly opposed are those measures which form the heart of the government's two bills. The second reading amendment that I have referred to is in nine paragraphs and I take the opportunity of going through paragraph by paragraph. In that logical way, I will draw fully to the attention of the House the opposition's concerns in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first paragraph of the amendment refers to the fact that this legislation is in breach of the government's election commitments, and I welcome the entry into the chamber of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) and the extension of the courtesy to listen to my remarks.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FISCHER" NAMEID="DG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr Tim Fischer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I've come all the way from Dubai to listen.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister asserts he has come all the way from Dubai. I think, from tracking his program, he arrived home yesterday. He does always extend full courtesy so far as parliamentary debate is concerned, and that is appreciated on this side. As the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister says across the table, `Now I propose to bore it right up him.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point is that this legislation is in breach of the government's election commitments. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting the challenges</EMPHASIS> document, which was distributed and circulated by the then shadow minister for trade and now Minister for Trade in the run&hyphen;up to the election, refers to maintaining the export market development grants scheme, continuing the innovative agricultural marketing program, maintaining the international trade enhancement scheme and maintaining the Asia-Pacific 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fellowships program. The EMDG scheme has been effectively gutted. The IAMP scheme, the ITES and the Asia-Pacific fellowships and business fellowships schemes have all been abolished in breach of election commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note in the document there is a commitment to `welcoming the contribution of the business community through chambers of manufactures and chambers of commerce and industry and other similar bodies to improve international trade performance'. So there is in this document an expressed commitment to consult with the relevant business community and to heed their remarks. Similar commitments are made in the coalition's industry and commerce policy, which was released by the now Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present government's election commitments went beyond those general comments. On page 40 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments </EMPHASIS>document, which the now Treasurer (Mr Costello) released in the concluding stages of the election campaign, the Treasurer proposed as the to&hyphen;be government's financial commitments a reduction to generate savings from greater efficiencies in Austrade and the export market development grants scheme of a total of $58.3 million&mdash;a combined reduction in expenditure from Austrade and the export market development grants scheme of $58.3 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The export market development grants scheme measures implemented by this piece of legislation reduce expenditure in EMDG alone by $426 million over four years. In the Austrade area, the annual reductions in appropriations are over $90 million per annum. So the first point to be made in respect of these measures is that they are in breach of expressed election commitments given by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, this legislation in respect of EMDG is in breach of personal undertakings and commitments given by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade while in opposition, and that is a matter that I refer to more in sorrow than in anger. In the course of the parliament's consideration of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2342"> Export Market Development Grants Bill 1996, in the course of public hearings before the relevant Senate committee, the executive secretary of the Australian Book Publishers Association, Ms Sue Donovan, took a question on notice and provided a written answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Association is extremely concerned about the threat to the future of the scheme, especially in view of the Government's election commitment to maintain it. This commitment was contained in the presentation of the Coalition trade policy by the Honourable Tim Fischer, MP, as Shadow Minister for Trade, to the National Press Club on 15 February 1996, and repeated on pages 1 and 8 of the Coalition's industry and commerce policy document released by the Honourable John Moore, MP, Shadow Minister for Industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which I have referred to. Ms Donovan went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These pronouncements reinforce the clear and unequivocal commitments to continue the scheme, without fiddling amendments, until 1999. This was also given to me by Mr Fischer at a meeting in his office on 29 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, in the course of discussions with exporters in the run&hyphen;up to the election, the now Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade gave personal commitments and undertakings to relevant export associations that the EMDG scheme would continue until 1999&mdash;on the five&hyphen;year review cycle that we have seen over the years&mdash;without fiddling amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can hardly regard the gutting of the financial commitment by the government and the narrowing of the focus of the scheme as fiddling amendments. They are substantial amendments. They are adverse for Australian exporters and adverse for our trade and export performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point the second reading amendment refers to is that these measures occur at precisely the time at which the government's own papers show that the net contribution of exports to growth in GDP will be negative. In 1995&hyphen;96, the budget papers show that the contribution of net exports to growth in GDP was a positive one per cent. In the budget papers which saw these particular measures announced by the government, the contribution of net exports to growth in GDP for 1996&hyphen;97 was forecast to be a negative three&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">quarters of a per cent. And in the mid&hyphen;year fiscal review released by the Treasurer early last month that negative contribution is forecast to continue not just for 1996&hyphen;97 but for 1997&hyphen;98. So at precisely that point in the cycle where the government's own papers forecast a negative contribution of net exports to growth in GDP, the government is gutting one of the most successful trade and export enhancement measures that has been in operation in this country since 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the government's own budget papers, if you look at the portfolio budget documents, Budget Related Paper No. 17 at page 87, you find that the success measure for the EMDG scheme is said to be an export performance ratio of 33:1. That measure, contained in the government's own budget related papers, occurs at precisely the same time as the Deputy Prime Minister announces the gutting and narrowing of this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That export performance, or export ratio, does not come out of the blue. The export market development grants scheme has been in operation since 1974 and over the years we have seen a myriad of reviews. In some respects the EMDG scheme has been reviewed to death. I will not go through very many of the reviews in any detail, but the first significant recent review of the EMDG scheme was the Hughes report of July 1989. That report recommended that the scheme continue for a further five years and drew attention in the course of the report's deliberations to the enhancement of an export culture and the incentives that the scheme provides to emerging exporters and exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of this report and in others, very many suggestions have been made for improvements or modifications to the scheme. They have been considered by the parliament and by many other people in the course of the years. There has never been any great difficulty on either side of the House, whichever side we occupy, in having a look at the various reports, having a look at the various suggestions for change, and dealing with them and considering them on their merits.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2343">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great difficulty with these particular changes is that they have not been made on merit. The Minister for Trade walked into the ERC, was given a global allocation of $150 million and told to make sure the scheme fell within that amount. He did not go through the objective process or the objective review, which has occurred over the years, of trying to discern which measures were effective, which measures would continue to be of assistance and incentive to Australian exporters. He simply got his budget bottom line and, when you look at Budget Related Paper No. 17, to which I have referred, the explanation for the gutting of the scheme is referred to simply as to meet the ERC savings target identified by the ERC in April of last year. There has been no objective review which has seen these measures come about as there has been in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In later years the Hughes report was followed by the McKinsey report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Emerging exporters: Australia's high value added manufacturing exporters</EMPHASIS>. That was in June 1993. Again, we find positive references to EMDG as `enhancing and assisting Australian companies' and `adding to Australia's  export culture'. You find similar remarks made in the Foreign Affairs and Trade report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winning enterprises: How Australia's small and medium enterprises compete in global markets</EMPHASIS>. The same is true of the June 1995 report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winning markets: Australia's future in the global economy</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austrade's annual report of 1995-96, which is worth referring to in a modest amount of detail, at page 39 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme attracted over 1200 new claimants who lodged grant applications in the 1995-96 financial year. $202 million in grants were paid during the year to 3,251 claims. Recipients in the 1995-96 financial year achieved $5.7 billion in exports resulting in a ratio of exports to grants of 28:1. Total administration cost for the scheme was $6.3 million, representing 3% of grants paid.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If I can just digress on the three per cent of grants paid, the $150 million, which it is proposed to cap the scheme at, includes up to a maximum of five per cent for administration. So the real amount available to Australian exporters is $142.5 million, if you take 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out the cost of administration. We are told that the administration is simplified but, on the one hand, we find that in the 1995-96 year administration came in at a cost of three per cent and, on the other hand, on what is lauded by the government to be a much simplified scheme we are told that administration will be as high as five per cent. The key point is that the cost of administration comes out of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Austrade report goes on to refer to the 1994 evaluation of the scheme <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Helping to meet the export challenge</EMPHASIS>, which demonstrated through independent economic analysis&mdash;that was Professor Bewley's report&mdash;that the scheme creates additional exports of up to 25 times the value of grants received. The report goes on to make further positive remarks about the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That report was followed by the two audit office reports&mdash;the 1993 report and the follow&hyphen;up report in 1996&mdash;which saw a range of changes made to the scheme in the 1995&hyphen;96 legislation. I see the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), the former minister, who introduced into the last parliament changes consistent with the audit office report, has entered the chamber to second my second reading amendment. He would be well aware of that 1993 report and also well aware of the September 1996 follow&hyphen;up report which effectively ticked the box on those particular changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the seminal report on the EMDG scheme was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Helping to meet the export challenge</EMPHASIS>, which was an evaluation of both the EMDG and ITES, the international trade enhancement scheme conducted in 1994. Without referring in any detail to that particular report, it is clear that that report is consistent with a range of reports that we have found over the years, that the EMDG scheme was achieving its objective of assisting Australian business, particularly small and medium size firms, to develop new export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also came to the conclusion that revenue which was gained by the Commonwealth from successful exporters who had utilised EMDG funds saw about 42c in the dollar come back to the Commonwealth by way of tax recipients. It again, by way of Professor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2344"> Bewley's report, made the point that the export benefit or the export ratio which we see from the expenditure of the EMDG dollar is more than comfortably met by export success. Those particular elements are covered by the opposition's second reading amendment, paragraphs (1) through to (4).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraph (5) of the amendment refers to the increased discretion provided to Austrade in the administration of the scheme. This has been a matter of some considerable concern both in the context of the Senate hearing and in the context of the submissions made to the government by way of comment on the exposure bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred earlier to the coalition's election commitments. One of the commitments in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting the challenges</EMPHASIS> trade document was to pay attention to and consult with the relevant industry and export groups. Drafts of these bills were put out for comment in December of last year. Over 170 submissions were received. A number of those submissions have been made available either to the Senate committee or generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some significant thrusts in those submissions. There has been opposition to the retrospective application of the proposed legislation. There has been opposition to the exclusion of trusts as corporate entities from the legislation. There has been significant concern about and opposition to the capping of the scheme at $150 million and significant concern at the narrowing of the eligible export activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the question of consultation that is worth drawing attention to. The minister, through his department, kindly made available to me a log of what are described as major technical amendments made to the draft EMDG Bill 1997 as a result of the consultation. There are about a dozen or so major technical amendments. There is also a series of about 30, I understand, minor technical amendments. But nowhere do we find a policy change or a change of substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that every reasonable suggestion made by industry groups, either by way of comment on the exposure bill or by way of submissions or evidence to the Senate com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mittee, has reflected considerable concern and anxiety on the part of industry, none of these concerns have in any way been taken up by the government. Those concerns are reflected in the final four paragraphs of the second reading amendment, which express the opposition's concern at the $150 million cap, the realisation that the real expenditure available to exporters is $142.5 million, and reject the notion of the capping of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would not, as I indicated earlier, be so bad if there had been some objectivity about the consultation, which was clearly a sham, or some objectivity and careful assessment about the way in which currently export eligible expenditure is proposed to be removed from the scheme. The scheme has been significantly narrowed and the eligible expenditure categories are proposed to be reduced from 11 to 12.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Patent registration, overseas buyer visits to Australia, foreign language training, international business education courses, export packaging and labelling design, tenders and quotations, technical information and subscriptions to associations are proposed to no longer be eligible, and airfares will only be eligible for the first two years. These have all been the subject of very considerable consternation and opposition by industry groups and individual exporters who have commented on the exposure bill or given evidence to the Senate committee.</PARA>

For an open&hyphen;ended scheme which relies upon the integrity of exporters, that is not a result which is at variance with any general defalcation or fraud on any Commonwealth scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2345">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The audit office reports of 1993 and 1996 drew attention to a range of measures which could be utilised to improve and enhance that. I have no difficulty with the Minister for Trade ensuring that people who seek to defraud this or any other Commonwealth scheme are vigilantly pursued, but that should not be used as an excuse to embark upon bad policy, to embark upon bad export measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you have discussions with exporters, whether it is by way of meeting with them out in the field, by way of taking anecdotal evidence or by way of reading submissions, they all say that airfares are absolutely essential to them, that it is important they establish contacts on the ground in the market destination and that, for companies who are particularly involved in intellectual property or in services, things like patent registration and technical information are important to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently I was in Adelaide and met with Hamiltons Pharmaceuticals. Patent and technical information and airfares  are absolutely vital to that company continuing to improve its export performance. So all those items which narrow the focus of the scheme have not been done by way of objective assessment. It has simply been drawing a line at $150 million and working backwards from that. In working backwards from that, the measures have aspects of retrospectivity about them which the opposition rejects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two aspects to the retrospectivity. The bulk of these measures, all but one, were announced on budget night, 20 August 1996, to take effect from 1 July 1996. The narrow ing of the scheme has an element of retrospectivity attached to it&mdash;from 20 August back to 1 July. Because this has to date been an open&hyphen;ended scheme, companies make commitments well in advance of that. So there is an element of retrospectivity which adversely affects exporters. Worse than that was the retrospective effect of the proposed removal of trusts from the scheme. That was announced on the first occasion on 16 December 1996 when the Deputy Prime Minister released the exposure draft for comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first occasion on which trusts became aware that they might no longer be eligible 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was 16 December. Trusts which were already in the scheme, trusts which regarded themselves as eligible, trusts which may well have already been recipients of grants under the scheme woke up on 17 December to be advised by their managers or agents that, as a result of a press release put out in the dying days of the parliament last year in the run&hyphen;up to Christmas, they were to be retrospectively excluded from the scheme. That measure is particularly pernicious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if we have seen the Minister for Trade explain either generally in public or to exporters that there is some particular problem generally with trusts as a corporate entity. If there is a particular problem with trusts as a corporate entity, the government should stand up and make that clear, and apply that particular approach so far as taxation and corporations laws are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the Treasurer has recently released a draft exposure bill in respect of the allocation of losses of trusts. That is a measure which to a large extent mirrors legislation put into the parliament by the previous government in the course of the last parliament. There is no difficulty in moving generally with trusts. But, if the government is proposing to remove trusts from this scheme, it should not do it retrospectively and it should not do it in a way which adversely affects the trusts that are currently recipients in the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading amendment, which I will formally move shortly, and the detailed amendments which I propose to move in the consideration in detail stage reflect the approach as far as the opposition is concerned: a rejection of the notion of capping the scheme at $150 million; a rejection of any adverse consequences of retrospectivity; and a rejection of the notion of narrowing the scheme in a way which does not help Australian exporters and does not help our export performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the litany of sins that we have seen from the government on trade and industry measures. We woke up on the morning after the budget and saw a range of broken promises&mdash;EMDG gutted, ITES gone, IAMP gone, a range of&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted tonight to stand and add my contribution to the debate on the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997. I do have somewhat of a history in talking about this particular government measure. My research assistant today brought me a file of copies of speeches I have made over a number of years in this House about EMDG, and I have to say that it was a rather thick folder&mdash;not quite as voluminous as the stack of reports of the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). Nonetheless, from time to time I have had a few words to say about this scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EMDG scheme is now 22 years old, and at the outset of my remarks I congratulate the department on the putting together of this bill. After 22 years of operation, reports, amendment after innumerable amendment and changes to the scheme, we finally have a new and rationalised bill that is easy to read and understand. It is logical in sequence and very well put together. It is in plain English, so that even a non-lawyer like me can relatively easily understand the provisions of the bill. The legislation that this bill replaces is not only old but also extremely complex, very difficult to follow and had created a great deal of confusion throughout industry. I might say, it probably made a lot of money for lawyers, practitioners, accountants and others in helping companies to try to deal with this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go back to what this bill is all about. The object of this act is to bring benefits to Australia by encouraging the creation, devel 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2347"> opment and expansion of foreign markets for Australian goods, services, intellectual property and know&hyphen;how. It does so by providing for an assistance scheme under which small and medium Australian exporters committed to, and capable of, seeking out and developing export business are repaid part of their expenses incurred in promoting those products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In listening to the honourable member for Perth, I rather got the idea that he thinks the scheme should forever be an open-ended scheme which would commit Australian taxpayers to increasing amounts of expenditure for ongoing export development work. I thought the intent of the original act was&mdash;and certainly the intent of today's bill is&mdash;as a leg&hyphen;up, a bit of a help for small and medium sized businesses to become involved in the export marketing business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want our businesses to export. I heard the former government and its ministers time after time in this place come in and talk about manufacturers, providers of intellectual property, providers of services, and companies dealing in know&hyphen;how as if they had no idea of what business opportunities they could avail themselves. The government simply said, `You must export.' I would go out and talk to my businesses, and they would say, `Look, the government says export, but what are they doing to help us? Are they doing anything to help us?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one area that I constantly pointed out to them. It was a scheme that had been supported by most major political parties for 22 years. We do support the export market development grants scheme. For the member for Perth to say that the scheme has been  gutted or discontinued is an absolute nonsense. It has not. The scheme has been modernised and simplified. Sure, the scheme has been capped. In a sense, I probably regret the necessity for capping the scheme. However, I point out to the honourable member for Perth that, if his mob had done the right thing with forward projections and the budget in 1995, they would not have left us with the mess that we copped in 1996, with $10 billion of unfunded government promises to spend in the future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where do you think the money was going to come from? The money has to come from somewhere. Do we continue to draw out of this bottomless well of funds which do not exist? Do we continue to put this kind of imposition on Australian taxpayers who are already not happy about the level of taxes they already support? Do we continue to put an impost on the Australian taxpayer to fund schemes to help industry continue to make better profits and to grow? I maintain that the intent of this scheme was always as a leg-up for small businesses and for medium sized businesses to get involved in the export market, to become efficient and productive, and to get out there and expand their exports as part of an overall government approach to exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that our exports are rising, particularly in manufactured goods and in intellectual property. The education sector's contribution to exports in Australia has expanded almost exponentially. The EMDG scheme has been very valuable. This streamlined, simplified rewritten bill in plain English now gives our businesses and their advisers a real good shot at understanding what complex legislation is all about and how it is to work every day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rules have been tightened in order to provide the right kind of assistance to the right people and for the right reasons. The tightening of the rules was not to exclude everyone but to make sure that we target this application of taxpayers' funds to the area likely to do us the most good and to businesses that honestly and sincerely need the most assistance&mdash;that is, small and medium sized businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new act implements the policy changes announced in the 1996 budget. In that sense, the cap on total EMDG spending is totally consistent with the government's approach to the 1996 budget, which was well received by the Australian public. It is still well received by the Australian public. It is certain that any company which is not able to receive as much benefit in the future from this program will be unhappy about that. If my pay were cut, I would not be very happy about that either. That is to be expected. That is in the nature 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2348"> of human beings, businesses and all good things. But that is no reason for the opposition to come into this place and criticise the government for capping a scheme to prevent excess expenditure of Australian dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme is about helping small and medium sized businesses export the eligible products that they may export in accordance with the requirements of the bill: our goods, our services, our intellectual property and our know&hyphen;how. There is a whole range of principle amendments to the act. The first amendment&mdash;the one which I will take the few minutes left to me tonight to talk about&mdash;is the one which finally says that the tourism industry is equal in status to all the other industries in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Perth spoke about this issue tonight. He said that the opposition fully supports the fact that we implemented an election pledge to bring the tourism industry into line with everybody else and finally recognise it as a  full player with respect to this scheme. I have said many times that we generically support the tourism industry through major funding every year to allow the tourism industry to advertise Australia to the rest of the world, to tell other people around the world what a great place this is, what a tremendous climate we have, how wonderful our people are, how hospitable we are, what a beautiful environment we have and the many features that might attract them to come visit with us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, for years and years we have said, `For export services, we consider the tourism industry has enough assistance in a generic sense so we will not help small and medium sized single service tourism operators to  advertise their products overseas.' We do not want them to help us go from the generic sense to the nitty&hyphen;gritty. For example, somebody might say to a travel agent in New York city or in Palermo or in Linz, Austria, `I think I would like to go to Australia. I saw this great ad on television. I read something in a magazine or a newspaper. Have you got any brochures on where I might stay?' The answer might be, `No, we don't have any of those.' Why do we not have any of them? Who is going to supply those brochures? The owners 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and operators of the specific tourism facilities in my electorate and all over Australia are the ones that will advertise those specific locations. But it is very difficult for them to target the entire world. So they are going to have to limit their meagre funds where they can do the best job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have maintained for a long time that the application of EMDG to single service tourism operators would be of great benefit to Australia. In 1994 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, of which I was a member, reported to the House in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Undersold overseas</EMPHASIS> that tourism should be treated equally to everyone else. What did the minister do? The minister rejected our advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later in 1994-95 the government finally brought in a proposal, after much pushing and mush pressure from the then opposition and now government, to make tourism operators half equal. They said, `You cannot get a 50 per cent return on the dollar; you can get a 25 per cent return, though.' So they sort of came halfway. Finally, thank goodness, this government has implemented good policy. It has said that tourism operators are just like anybody else, and they deserve a shot at export market development grants where applicable and if they spend the money.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

If I had known of his pending attack, I would have made sure I was here to respond. However, my constituents do not expect me to sit here waiting in case he might make an attack. They expect me to get on with my parliamentary duties and their representations. But there will be other occasions when I hope to be able to return the courtesy to the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hold my head up proudly that I have helped to expose the heartless and callous charges that this mean&hyphen;spirited government is trying to impose on frail, sick Australians from 1 July next. No matter how the member may seek to delude himself or to mislead others in respect of this government's charges that it wants extracted from people entering nursing homes after 1 July 1997, the truth is that large numbers of sick, aged Australians, mainly women, are going to be slugged. The claims by the honourable member that elderly citizens will not have to sell their homes to obtain nursing home care are simply pathetic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why does he persist in trying to delude himself? Why does he persist in trying to mislead those who may need the care of a nursing home? As I said, the claims are simply pathetic. The government's own publication, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aged Care News</EMPHASIS>, of October 1996 states on page 4:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nobody will be forced to sell their former home.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Who are they trying to fool? People can read, people can understand, and it is clear, it is explicit. The expectation is that people will have to sell their homes. I do not have to convince people of it; they can read for themselves. The rhetoric of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) that nobody will be forced to sell their former home is clearly untrue. The government's supposed nursing home reforms clearly show the con 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tempt in which they hold our frail and sick citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to another source, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Voice of Pensioners and Superannuants in NSW</EMPHASIS>. Dare I show it to you, Mr Speaker, so that I can be seen to present the original document. The front page headline reads, `Senate Inquiry into Draft Aged Care Bill,' and the subheading reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If you are a pensioner and your only asset is your home, the only option you have is to sell the house or not go into a nursing home."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on, in the body of the story, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Minister continues to say that people will not have to sell their homes. However, that's not true," CPSA President Ms Norah McGuire said.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Members can read, I am sure, through the rest of that front&hyphen;page article for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seven out of 10 people entering nursing homes are women. They go into nursing homes because they need to be in nursing homes. It is ridiculous for people on the other side to be saying, `Oh yes, but that is the kind of arrangement for going into a hostel.' You have an option about a hostel. You go into a nursing home because you have been assessed by the aged assessment team as category 1 to 5 and you need to be there. It is not a matter of choice; it is because you need to be there. So, at the time in life when women most need help, what this government is saying to them is, `If you are one of those women, come 1 July of this year you will be forced to sell up or rearrange your financial affairs to find the money that is needed to meet the entry fee contribution.' And trying to dress it up as accommodation bonds and all other kinds of euphemisms does not fool anybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My warning to the residents of the Central Coast is to be aware of the disgraceful campaign of deceit being conducted by government members&mdash;a campaign aimed at concealing the truth about its changes to nursing home care. There is no upper limit on what an elderly resident can be forced to pay. No upper limit has been set, and all that a nursing home proprietor is required to do is to leave the person with assets totalling $22,500.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to congratulate all those who were involved in organising and participating in the parliament's first youth suicide seminar held on Friday, 28 February and opened by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I want to place on the record a particular acknowledgment of the work of the federal member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs in making the seminar such a success.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased to attend this seminar a few weeks ago. I believe it is an extremely important issue in the context of today's society and that we need to do all we can as politicians to encourage and support solutions to youth suicide. It is true that the youth suicide rate has risen alarmingly, particularly over the last 15 years. I was absolutely astounded by figures from the Australian Institute of Criminology which suggest that every day in Australia there are six completed suicides and 180 attempts. Our country has one of the highest suicide rates in the industrialised world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter how you look at these figures, it is a devastating blight on our society. Youth suicide is not an issue which we can sweep under the covers or bury behind closed doors. It is an issue which in many cases is cloistered in intergenerational codes of silence. It is a problem that is growing, it is a problem which is becoming much more complex and it is a problem which is costing lives. It  cannot be assumed that even our own neighbourhoods are immune to suicide. I know that there are many cases in my own electorate of Petrie where no words can explain the heartbreak, the destruction and the loss felt by families who are caught in these particular situations. What drives our kids to self&hyphen;destruction and what leads our young people to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> get to the stage where they feel there is absolutely no turning back?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government cares for young people and has acknowledged that assistance is needed to stem the level of youth suicide. The government has initiated the national youth suicide strategy, which will provide parents and young people with the skills and support that they need to cope with these crises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the speakers at the conference, whom I found very informative a few weeks ago, was Associate Professor Pierre Baume. He is a Brisbane based professor and is at Griffith University. He is the Director of the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention. A recognised person in the fields of suicide support and prevention, he was previously Chairman of the National Health and Medical Research Council suicide prevention committee. Recently, Professor Baume completed a paper which was titled `Cybersuicide: the role of interactive suicide notes on the Internet' with co-authors Dr Christopher Cantor and Mr Andrew Rolfe from the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Professor Baume spoke about this issue of suicide on the Internet at the seminar a few weeks ago, he stunned the room with stories and instances of the Internet acting as a medium between life and death. As my learned colleagues would be aware, the Internet and cyberspace is capturing the attention of more and more Australians on a daily basis&mdash;a technology where the only limit is one's imagination. The research paper found that there was a really strong preoccupation towards suicide on the Internet. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suicide features in an enormous range of internet resources. A search for the word `suicide' using a number of search engines has revealed thousands of matches.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report also deals with tributes to suicide victims, electronic mailing lists, suicide notes and people using news groups and talk programs to transmit and promote the art of suicide. Notes can be found on the Internet pages detailing torrid stories and people threatening to take their own lives. What we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2351"> are dealing with here is virtual reality where the surreal is playing mind games. It is not fiction from a novel nor drama from a television series. It is real life lost through the keyboard. It seems that the Internet has the potential to influence behaviour here. It may be a medium which is only very new, but the level of influence cannot ever be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding, an important point is made in the research paper which deserves repeating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cybersuicide is now a reality. We can ignore it, or we can develop new strategies to promote the positive nature of interaction of this kind as well as to minimise its negative impact, for those communication conduits have limitless potential.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">High&hyphen;tech suicide is definitely becoming the suicide of the future and it is important that we take an integrated approach and a coordinated approach in tackling this problem. We need to work jointly as a community to ensure that we prevent these suicide strategies. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2351"><TITLE>Irish Immigrants</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable members would be aware and indeed the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) is certainly aware, yesterday was St Patrick's Day, which was enthusiastically commemorated throughout Australia and rightly so. Australia is, after Ireland, the most Irish country in the world. About 30 per cent of the people who live in this country have some Irish antecedent, be it a grandparent or a great grandparent or, in recent years, they themselves came from Ireland. Often, the Irish looked to America as the place where the Irish went.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, this country is where the Irish not only came but were very successful. I suppose, in some ways, they took over the political system. While the Irish were still struggling in Ireland, the Irish in Australia  had in many parts of this country become the ascendancy. Most of those Irish people or people of Irish descent in Australia tend to forget the reasons that their antecedents came here to Australia. But there are a number of people who have formed a committee in Sydney, people like Tom Power, Ian Caruth, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Terrie Pollard and Annie Rahe, who want to get Australians of Irish descent to understand what that very seminal change in Irish history was about that occurred 150 years ago: the great famine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great famine is something that anyone whose parents, grandparents or great grandparents who live in Australia knows was a reason that their relations left Ireland and came to Australia. Most of us do not understand too clearly why that was. The famine is something that is not really understood in this country because we are so far from Ireland and that Irish experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this group of people in Sydney wants to set up a memorial to the famine. On the 150th anniversary of the famine, which occurred between 1845 and 1848, it is useful for all of us of Irish descent, and all Australians who believe in justice, to think about what happened there in Ireland at that time, because, while half a million people came to Australia during the 19th century from Ireland around the famine time or just after, a lot of that history has been forgotten in this country. There are some terrible statistics about that famine that we should recall. In 1845, the population of Ireland was 8.6 million. In 1850 the population was 5.5 million. Between 1845 and 1850, 1.1 million people died of starvation and two million of them left their country and went to the US, Australia and to other parts of the English&hyphen;speaking world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between 1800 and 1899, in that century, nine million people left Ireland. In 1900, 30 per cent of all Australians were of Irish descent&mdash;at present it is a little bit more. In 1910 the population of Ireland, only 55 years after the beginning of the famine, was 4.3 million&mdash;less than half of what it had been 65 years before. These people in Sydney believe that it is important for the Australian understanding of the Irish tradition that we should erect a statue to commemorate those women who came from Ireland to Australia, particularly those younger women, those young orphaned girls, many thousands of whom came to this country, who were made homeless after the death of their parents. They indeed became the pioneer women of the outback of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this House to speak on the recent media speculation that a second airport is to be built at Holsworthy and that a nuclear reactor is to be relocated from Lucas Heights to Jervis Bay, part of which is in my electorate of Gilmore and part of which is in the electorate of Fraser. I use the time in this adjournment debate to categorically deny that the nuclear reactor will be relocated to Jervis Bay and to advise my constituents that this relocation is not and never has been on any agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The source of this malicious rumour is currently being investigated and I am sure it will soon come to light. This rumour has caused a tremendous amount of angst in my electorate, especially amongst our Aboriginal community, for much of the area in question is of significance to them. I am glad to say that other members in the community have treated this rumour with the contempt it deserves. I view this gossip with distaste and suspicion and trust the media will also view it for what it is: a very sick joke. I sincerely  hope that those who took it upon themselves to contact me with their concerns have now had their concerns allayed. I also inform the House that I contacted both the Minister for Science and Technology, the Hon. Peter McGauran, and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon. John Sharp,

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the member for Fraser, Mr Steven Dargavel, what he has done to quell this wicked hearsay, for part of Jervis Bay is also in his electorate. During my contact with members of the Jervis Bay community on this matter, it appears that no efforts were made by the member for Fraser to appease the concerns of his constituents. This matter has been an uncalled&hyphen;for diversion of government and I trust that it will now be put to rest so that we can get on with the job of running the country as we were asked to do by the members of our electorates.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2352"><TITLE>Nuclear Reactor: Relocation

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in a similar vein to the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash), who spoke very briefly on defending her constituents against the possibility, as she put it, of them becoming radioactive. The government clearly has made a decision, however, to locate a nuclear reactor in her electorate and it ought to be something that all her constituents should be aware of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of equal concern to that particular matter in Gilmore was the return to what I might best call grassroots democracy within the Victorian municipalities of my state when over the course of last weekend 53 councils had returned to democracy after what might best be called a three&hyphen;year hiatus. I would like to briefly commend the successes of several of my friends and colleagues&mdash;notably Councillor Bill Nixon, who was tonight sworn in as the inaugural mayor of the city of Kingston, and the first-time councillors elected in that municipality, notably Di Comtesse, Darlene Salisbury and John Ronk. Equally, in the city of Casey, I commend people like Janet Halsell on her election and, in the city of Frankston, my colleague Bill McCluskey for a stirling job that he did in campaigning to gain election as the councillor for the ward of Buninyong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some concerns associated with the return to democracy in Victoria. It may be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2353"> said that ratepayers may gain from economies of scale generated by the creation of 78 councils from formerly some 200, being as they are now organised along corporate lines with the CEOs being granted more power. One would have thought, as put by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> editorial of 18 March, that `this should bode well for ratepayers'. However, there is no doubt now a cloud hanging over this return to democracy following the comments of the Victorian state Minister for Planning, the Hon. Robert Maclellan, who said that any meddling, as he put it, with planning issues by newly elected councillors could see them forfeit some of their new powers to their CEOs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Maclellan, as planning minister, has a fairly long and dubious record of intervention and gives the distinct impression that he is, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> editorial puts it, `determined to curb the rights of councillors to involve themselves in what is one of the most important facets of their job'. That same Minister for Planning, Mr Maclellan, recently told a meeting of council CEOs that, if councillors were seen to be meddling in planning issues, they could relinquish some of those planning powers to CEOs, who themselves would become the responsible authority. This is no doubt nothing more nor less than an outrageous attack on democracy and is symptomatic of the arrogant state government in my state that day by day loses touch with the Victorian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Planning has been a major concern of local residents within various municipalities under the commissioners, and the Kennett government would have realised that planning was of course a serious factor when candidates were campaigning in the recent council elections. There has been `a sense of residential certainty' which `has been replaced by ministerial call-ins, site&hyphen;specific exemptions and ad hoc planning', to use the words of Mr Demetri Dollis in his letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> today. Many community groups, increasingly mar ginalised from this planning process and concerned with the adverse impact on their local environments, are for the first time now questioning the credibility of this planning system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, Mr Maclellan's record over the past 4&half; years is perhaps one of interventionist approaches to the max. I can of course cite in my own electorate the case of the Sandhurst golf development, where the lungs of Melbourne, the green wedge, was for the first time ripped asunder to allow urban development in this otherwise green area. I urge Mr Maclellan to reconsider his sentiments and to allow newly elected councillors the opportunity to truly represent democratically their constituents and afford them the powers under planning arrangements. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2353"><TITLE>Forde Community Contribution Awards</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to recognise some very special people in my electorate of Forde. We in this House make laws and decisions that have a lasting effect in communities throughout Australia, but it is true to say that these special people help those communities and they are the heart and soul of our community. I am talking about the many tireless voluntary workers who give so much of themselves to ensure that the community organisations and charities are there to help local residents, families in need, the elderly, veterans and the wider community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was delighted last week to formally recognise the efforts of 10 such workers in Forde with the 1997 Forde Community Contribution Award. I established these awards as a way for the community to say thank you to those quiet achievers who never seek or desire recognition. While they never seek recognition, I think it is only fitting that we take the time to let them know that their efforts are appreciated and that they have made a difference in so many people's lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each of the award recipients was nominated by grateful local residents. Each of the Forde Community Contribution Award winners has a consistent record over many years of helping the community. I would like to take the time tonight to mention these people and list very briefly their achievements. Of course, there is not enough time to mention every aspect of their work over the years, so this is by no means a comprehensive list.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2354">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The award winners include Ollie Mutsch of Logan Village for her community work for the Logan Village Community Centre and the Logan Village Community Hall Association. Ollie has been involved in these groups for over 50 years. She is a very caring person who over the years has been a foster parent to many children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dawn Edwards of Tamborine Mountain was nominated for her service to the community on Tamborine Mountain in many different ways. She was Leader in the Guides and Brownies for 12&half; years. She also is a Sunday school teacher and is the backbone of a club called the Kiah Club, which brings companionship and enjoyment to the lonely, the sick and those who have little contact with the outside world. Mrs Edwards arranges the entertainment program for the club.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Harry Thorsen is a stalwart in the Logan Village community. He has been nominated because of his work as Chairman of Logan Village Neighbourhood Watch and Vice Chairman of the Logan Village Residents Association, and for his work on the Local Hall Committee, the Community Centre Committee and the Anzac Committee. He has also just recently been ordained as a deacon in St Luke's Church.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Kath Ryan of Beaudesert has for 20 years worked tirelessly for St Vincent de Paul, Beaudesert Care and Concern, and the Country Women's Association in Beaudesert. She is a delightful lady with a generous smile and a generous heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Maisie Lewis of Beaudesert has been Secretary of the Show Society and a long&hyphen;time member of the Historical Society, and has also worked for the Blue Nurses. She has made a very musical contribution to the community in Glad's Girls and the U.C. Choir.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Thelma Ward of Beaudesert was Treasurer of the Wongaburra Auxiliary for many years and has worked for the Red Cross and has done fundraising for the Cancer  Foundation. Mrs Ward has given 20 years plus to the community.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Pat Aldridge of Veresdale has a list of service so long it is quite incredible. He worked for Rotary, the Cancer Foundation, the National Seniors Association and Beaudesert Care and Concern. Beaudesert and district are richer for having his service and help he so voluntarily gives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Barry Cunningham of Canungra has, since the late 1970s, been Canungra RSL Management Committee Chairman. He has also been Chairman of the Fundraising Committee since 1981. He established the permanent RSL club. He has worked voluntarily at the Canungra Information Centre since 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Kay Curran of Loganholme was recognised for the collection of food and farming supplies distributed to drought affected families in both Queensland and New South Wales, and her work in the Leukemia Foundation, Save the Koala Fund and the Beenleigh High School Young Achievers Award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Mollie Horne was nominated for her work on the Anglican Church Guild, Beaudesert Hospital Auxiliary, Beaudesert RSL, Wongaburra Nursing Home, the CWA and the local Meals on Wheels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that all members of the House would join me in thanking these 10 special people for their tremendous efforts and indeed the many thousands of voluntary workers in communities around the nation. In my view, they deserve every accolade. They are the heart and soul of our community. Once again, I thank the recipients of the 1997 Forde Community Contribution Award for their selfless ongoing work.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2355"> with regard to the export market development grants scheme, the Export Market Development Grants Bill and the debate around it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I probably will not have the opportunity to enter into the full debate but, as a former minister for trade, I have to say I am extremely disappointed with and concerned about the implications for Australian exports and the Australian economy of the changes which have been made which are, as my colleague the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) pointed out, a flagrant breach of an election promise&mdash;an election promise which, to my chagrin, was made in a debate with me at the National Press Club when the then Leader of the National Party and shadow minister, the now Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), was outlining the trade policies for the then opposition. We had a fairly robust but friendly debate at the National Press Club, and he made a very clear and unequivocal commitment, which has been clearly and unequivocally breached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That in itself is a problem, but what worries me about this broken promise is its implications. All the research which I saw as minister for trade made it very clear that, first and foremost, EMDGs, the export market development grants, were an effective way of getting new exporters into the field and helping small to medium enterprises which wish to export to make the transition successfully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequence of that for the broader Australian economy is its impact on the capacity of the economy to sustain a rate of growth sufficiently high to get down our unemployment. Research shows that the trajectory of growth that is sustainable, without running into a current account deficit problem, is influenced by the proportion of our economic output that is exported. The export market development grants scheme was one of a number of initiatives which were influencing that proportion favourably and therefore creating the potential for the Australian economy to grow and to grow at a rate sufficient to maintain four per cent plus growth and therefore to sustain continuing  falls in unemployment, which Australia so sorely needs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The AFP is the primary law enforcement agency through which the Commonwealth pursues its law enforcement interests. The AFP is unique in Australian law enforcement in that its functions include both community policing in the Australian Capital Territory and the protection of the interests 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Commonwealth including the investigation of offences against Commonwealth law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AFP is an integral part of the law enforcement and policing matrix of Australia. The AFP contributes to the national law enforcement arena by participating in the management, support and use of common police services and participating in forums such as the Australasian and South-West Pacific Region Police Commissioners' Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The AFP provides support and enhances the international law enforcement obligations of the Commonwealth and maintains a high profile in the international law enforcement arena. The activities of the AFP overseas liaison officer network and the Interpol National Criminal Bureau (NCB) are central to achievements in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFP liaison officers provide a valuable resource for intelligence and investigations on a wide range of criminal activity. The efforts of the liaison officer network complement the activities of the Interpol NCB which handles the more formal exchange of police information and requests at international level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The liaison officers are widely used in police-to-police requests both to and from host countries and Australia, in a diverse range of investigations including homicide, drug trafficking, paedophile inquiries, fraud, money laundering and organised crime activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The AFP provides the principal policing response to the importation of illicit drugs into 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2358"> Australia. To provide an effective response, the AFP must continue to work with other Commonwealth agencies, such as the Australian Customs Service and the National Crime Authority as well as with State, Territory and overseas law enforcement organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The AFP has the responsibility for investigating serious fraud against the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AFP has recognised and addressed a critical need to complement its professional fraud investigation team resources. It now employs specialists in forensic accountancy, international financial systems and computing technology. It also employs lawyers with the required skills and experience to provide investigators with specialist advice on the intricacies of legislation under which fraud offences may occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">White-collar criminal activity frequently involves breaches of State and Commonwealth criminal and regulatory legislation. The pursuit of evidence often will be helped by access to the intelligence and information holdings of agencies such as the AFP, State police services, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) and the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). Considerable emphasis is placed on the cooperative aspects of investigations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AFP has contributed to the development of Commonwealth fraud control policy and procedures through its participation in numerous committees and working groups including the Commonwealth Investigation Technical Standards Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Fraud Investigation Database (CFID), for which the AFP acts as host agency, was established to support agency and AFP fraud investigations and to provide statistical information to Government.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Central to the AFP's core business is the need to counter organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Organised crime was defined by the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Review (CLER) as a systematic and continuing conspiracy to commit serious offences.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my opinion, in order for someone to be described as an `Aboriginal person' within the meaning of that term in the Act, some degree of Aboriginal descent is essential, although by itself a small degree of such descent is not sufficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All that is required to satisfy the requirement of indigenous descent is that there be evidence of indigenous descent.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The requirement is that in order to establish a claim to being an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander a person is required to provide evidence of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Courts already have the power to require the genetic testing of Australians for some forensic purposes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7 &amp; 8) A person would only be required to establish that they were an Aboriginal if that person made a claim to access services available to Aboriginal people or sought to exercise the rights of Aboriginal people and there was some doubt that that person was an Aboriginal person.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9 &amp; 10) Aboriginal communities themselves determine when to identify an individual as an Aboriginal.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Mrs Bishop</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. Since 1992 the Defence Housing Authority has been classified as a Government Business Enterprise but the payment of taxes and dividends was deferred until the completion of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2361"> Government's commitment made at the time of the Authority's establishment, that over a decade $750 million in real terms would be provided to improve Defence housing. That commitment has now been met and the Authority has been required to pay a dividend of $33.6 million on 1995&hyphen;96 earnings, being at the rate of dividend set for Government Business Enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The DHA's housing program prior to the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget deliberations was that contained in its three year Corporate Plan 1995&hyphen;98 and provided for capital expenditure of $167.3 million in 1996&hyphen;97. This Corporate Plan, prepared in 1995, acknowledged that the exemption from dividends was to be reviewed by 30 June 1996 as the $750 million capital program would by then be completed. It was recognised that under then prevailing provisioning arrangements, the outcome of the review might cause a revision of projections for years after 1995/96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The DHA's housing program for 1996&hyphen;97 in Corporate Plan 1996&hyphen;99 provides for capital expenditure of $94.4 million, and also provides for an accelerated debt repayment program over previous planning. In addition the DHA has made a major policy change from ownership of housing to an emphasis on long term leasings from the private sector housing investment market whenever feasible. The capital program is therefore less indicative than previously of planned housing achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The DHA's housing program in any year is a blend of meeting essential Defence Force operational requirements and making staged changes to the housing stock that match the DHA's planned available resources, such as reducing the numbers of members renting privately and upgrading the older stock. However, in the period between developing the 1995/96 and 1996/97 housing programs, the DHA has considerably expanded the numbers of houses delivered through leasing rather than purchase or construction. The DHA therefore does not need to have the same level of capital funds to  meet the same level of housing outcomes as in previous years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) In 1996/97 the DHA will acquire by purchase or construction in excess of 400 houses, predominantly in areas of limited housing markets, and will lease an additional 300 houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) There will be increases to stocks of DHA managed housing in high priority areas. Approximately current levels of members renting privately will continue to do so. There has been some rescheduling of the housing upgrade program as the DHA has ceased its reliance on interest bearing loans and uses funds as they become available from sales. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Currently the DHA pays some Commonwealth taxes, such as fringe benefits tax and sales tax on certain items. In addition it makes payments in lieu of local government charges to local councils.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr Wooldridge</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to (a) and (b) only those persons who are recognised as native title holders by the common law are entitled to a determination of native title, and for this reason not all traditional owners or Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders will necessarily succeed in obtaining such a determination. It is essential for a successful determination that the claimants show that they have maintained a continuing connection with the land or waters concerned in accordance with their traditional laws and customs. The concept of "native title holders", however, is not synonymous with "traditional owner" as the native title rights of some traditional owners may have been extinguished or otherwise ceased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of whether the persons referred to in the question would be able "to reside within lands for which title has been or shall be granted under the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Native Title Act", the answer to the question is in two parts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, native title is not in fact "granted" under the Native Title Act 1993 (the NTA). The NTA provides for the making of determinations that native title exists or does not exist in relation to an area of land or waters and details the processes which are to be followed in order to establish whether or not native title exists. Before the NTA was enacted, a determination of native title could be sought through the courts under the common law. A determination that native title exists is the formal recognition of the pre&hyphen;existing common law rights that have been and are still held by the persons who are the subject of the determination. The concept of a "determination" is distinct from the concept of a "grant" where a right is conferred on a person who does not already hold that right. As native title rights already exist, they may be exercised whether or not there has been determination under the Native Title Act. After a determination that native title exists has been made, native title may be held by a body corporate on behalf of the native title holders, or it may be held directly by the native title holders with a body corporate acting as a representative for the holders in certain matters affecting their native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, the issue of whether the native title rights of a particular group of native title holders include the right to reside on land subject to their native title will depend on the particular facts and tenure history of the areas concerned and on the customary laws giving rise to the native title. This can only be assessed on a case by case basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As native title is not a "tenure" within the normal understanding of that term in Anglo&hyphen;Australian property law, it is not appropriate to speak of "security of tenure" in relation to native title. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2375"> Security of title of native title holders, however, is a matter dealt with by the NTA. Paragraph 3(a) of that Act states that one of the purposes of the Act is the recognition and protection of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Native title holders are entitled to the protection afforded their title by the NTA and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 regardless of whether there has been a formal determination that their native title exists. However, the protection given by these Acts does not mean that native title cannot be adversely affected or extinguished. Like other interests in land or waters, native title is not immune from acts of the Crown. Under the common law, native title is susceptible to extinguishment by the Crown, for example by the valid grant of an interest which is inconsistent with the continued existence of native title. It can also be surrendered by the native title holders or die out by reason of loss of continuing connection to the area concerned. Since the commencement of the NTA, native title has only been able to be extinguished or affected in accordance with the NTA. Under the NTA, as is the case with other interests in land or waters, native title can be compulsorily acquired by the Crown, and may be validly affected by certain other acts (known as future acts).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NTA establishes processes to be followed when future acts are done, with the nature of the acts determining which processes are to be followed. Apart from the acts specified in subsection 26(2) of the NTA (which include the grant of mining interests), the general rule is that native title holders are to be accorded the same procedural rights in relation to a future act on land as they would have if they instead held freehold title to that area. The process to be followed in relation to the grant of mining interests and the other acts to which subsection 26(2) applies is known as the right to negotiate and does not amount to power of veto. It is a right to negotiate about a proposed act and if no agreement is reached, to have the matter determined by an arbitrator.</PARA>
