<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill puts into place key elements of Labor's textile, clothing and footwear plan. It is the first stage of locking in bipartisan support on assistance to this crucial industry. It is totally consistent with the motion moved by the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) and the member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) and therefore should on this occasion be supported by those members. When given the chance on the last occasion, they did not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is a commitment that goes further than simply the freeze of tariffs. The bill gives industry certainty by ensuring that TCF tariffs remain at the year 2000 levels until at least 31 December 2004. However, Labor has never seen the level of tariffs as the whole solution for industry. That is why we have had schemes in place to get us competitively into export markets&mdash;the import credit scheme and the export facilitation scheme in the case of automotive industry. We have consistently argued that these be retained and it seems now that the government supports us in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, given the importance of the import credit scheme to the industry, I also foreshadow today that, if the government's response on this replacement scheme is inadequate, Labor will introduce a further private member's bill to keep that scheme in place but in a way that is consistent with our commitments under APEC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor also differs from the government on the matter of the review of what should happen post 2005. Come the next election, whatever John Howard would like to happen, there will be a clear distinction between where the parties stand on this issue. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the coalition support automatic reduction of TCF tariffs, no matter what our trading partners do. He is for delaying what we do for five years but he is still committed to unilateral disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, Labor will use our position to press other countries to adhere to their commitments. We will ensure, if elected, that we will have a comprehensive review in 2004 to determine the assistance needed beyond 2005, taking full account of the impact on regional Australia and the progress of our trading partners in reducing their barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we will also tie further assistance to this industry not only to investment, exports and job obligations, but to a satisfactory resolution of the outworker issue. Against Labor's plan, industry has committed to job security, investment growth and export growth&mdash;the three most pressing economic issues facing the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has now adopted our position on TCF tariffs to the year 2005. Having always talked tough on tariff reductions, they have now accepted Labor's sensible export and job friendly policy. The only position the coalition has ever held on tariffs is that which Labor has put in place and advocated. Labor has led the way in terms of its support for the automotive and TCF industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year we rejected the ideologically driven and isolated advice of the Industry Commission on the automotive industry. We have consistently argued a position on these industries which is now adopted. We rejected the calls to walk away from Australia's 150,000 TCF and automotive workers, but at the same time we did not walk away and we will not be walking away from our international trade commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the government's cave&hyphen;in on these issues, we now have an element of bipartisanship. It is now up to the government to prove its commitment to that bipartisanship by supporting this bill. We want this legislation in place before the next election. In theory there is no need for the TCF legislation until the year 2000, but Labor does not want to see this become another non&hyphen;core promise to be discarded as soon as the election is over 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7976"> or if the Liberals decide to change their leadership before the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Labor wins the next election, we will ensure that industry has the certainty inherent in Labor's TCF and auto plans. But just to be sure, we want it in place before the next election, otherwise we will see more of the recent confusion which has been so bad for security, investment and job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a commitment which the Labor Party has led and won on. We urge the parliament to support this very important bill. I ask leave of the House to present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> regrets that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel felt it was too costly and impractical to receive in person the Parliament's congratulations, gratitude and recognition of their distinguished service and apologises for the Minister's slight of these gallant soldiers.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, you would be aware that it has been the past practice of the former Minister for Defence and, I trust, the new one to select 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> members of this parliament&mdash;that is, members of this House and senators&mdash;to visit Australian peacekeepers at the place of their operation. Both you and I were privileged to go to Somalia and again to Rwanda in company with the then Senator Loosley and Senator MacGibbon. All of us who travelled to see our Australian peacekeepers, I believe, felt it a distinguished honour that we should be so selected and felt it important that the Australian parliament should have representatives to witness first&hyphen;hand the good work that these peacekeepers did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rwanda was no different from Somalia. There the Australian peacekeepers performed outstanding work and were very highly regarded in a country we previously had no connection with. In particular, in relation to the camp at Kibeho that we visited, it is salutary to think that some of the people that we saw there were amongst the 5,000 who were subsequently massacred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud the ADF for their acknowledgment of the gallantry of those Australians involved in the camp. But I regret that the history of bipartisanship has been misunderstood by the relevant minister. It was never a suggestion when I asked you a question in this place about the awarding of the gallantry medals that a visit to parliament should have been a substitute for the investiture at the Governor&hyphen;General's residence. All I was seeking was information as to why perhaps those who had visited the theatre of operations were not invited there. Having accepted that we were not invited, I was seeking an opportunity to have the parliament acknowledge the good work of the peacekeepers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, in response to question No. 1473 that I asked the minister on notice, she maintains the belief that I was asking for a substitute service or presentation. That is not true. Secondly, it was really disappointing that, in her answer to my question, she suggested that the cost of $17,000 in a budget of $10 billion was too much for the defence forces to bear. Last but not least, anyone who has the slightest connection with defence understands there is the possibility of opportunity flights for the RAAF which would cut 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7977"> down the individual transportation costs of the officers involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret that the minister appears to be or has given the appearance of being very mean&hyphen;spirited in failing to understand what were basically good bipartisan intentions in wanting to have these officers' service duly recognised by the parliament. I hope in the future that we can learn from this and understand that there are members of parliament on both sides of the House who are always keen to see in particular the outstanding peacekeeping operations of the ADF appropriately recognised. We can do that now on the floor of the House by inviting them to attend. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join with the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who has moved this motion, in congratulating our servicemen and servicewomen who have once again shown what fabulous defence forces Australia has. We are very privileged and fortunate to have such personnel in their ranks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his concluding remarks the honourable member mentioned that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) gave the appearance of not being interested, or to that effect, in these service personnel. I would point out to the honourable member in the House that the minister actually attended the investiture ceremony at government house and conveyed her heartfelt thanks to these people on behalf of the parliament and the nation on a one on one basis and in a very personal manner. She also acknowledged in question time the role that they played with the Australian forces in Rwanda. In no way does she belittle the awards that were made and the efforts undertaken by these people. It is a shame that you should feel that way and that you have politicised what really is a fabulous effort by these four personnel and should be recognised as such.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is not understood by many Australians is that when we have sent personnel overseas in the past it has been predominantly to fight wars. Terrible as that may be, the fact 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is that the battle lines are drawn and the rules of engagement are quite clear&mdash;you shoot to kill. You shoot to protect yourself, your ground, the men around you and the cause for which you are fighting. What is not so easily understood is that when our personnel have been undertaking operations in places such as Rwanda those rules of engagement are somewhat different. When you start to wear the blue beret of the United Nations these lines become very fuzzy and very grey indeed. The pressures that they put on all personnel operating in these areas are quite immense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For one of the gentlemen who has been awarded a gallantry medal here, the words spoken of him are `as he stood in front of a wounded Rwandan national as he was about to be killed'. Those sorts of scenarios very rarely would come up in conventional battle. He had to put his own life not just at risk but at great peril in order to protect this person. It was not the traditional method of killing, of defending or of attacking. In this case, it was defending somebody's life, as you might in the street from thugs or whatever else. Quite often the people they were confronted with there were no more than thugs and murderers who were not so much for a cause as looking for their own opportunism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It says a great deal about Australian service personnel that throughout the years, regardless of where they have been asked to represent this great nation of ours, they have always performed to the highest possible standards. In Rwanda, Somalia and Cambodia, in all of these fields, the challenges that have beset them have been quite different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As an ex&hyphen;serviceman, I know full well that even in training for these activities it is always difficult to draw the line between the rules of engagement that apply and your instincts in the training that you undertake which says `protect yourself'. It is little known that these people are not to fire unless they believe their lives are directly affected. Can you imagine for one moment a man standing there, protecting a person who has already been shot in the leg, with someone&mdash;probably more than one person&mdash;armed in front of him? Does he retaliate immediately and fire, or does he use the strength, courage 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7978"> and commitment and the training and self-discipline that he has been taught through the defence forces of Australia to protect that person? What a judgment. It is not one that I would ever care to have thrust upon me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is absolutely exemplary of the training Australian defence forces have. We may be only a small force, but these four people have done us extremely proud. We can be reassured that, whenever Australian troops represent us in whatever forum overseas, they do it with the professionalism and the dedication that the Defence Force of Australia has been renowned for for nearly 100 years.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> calls on the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to take action to ensure that naval veterans of the Malayan theatre are recognised with the relevant campaign medal and the Returned from Active Service Badge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe that recognition of those who served in the navy in the Malayan emergency is long overdue. From research of those who served 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and their families, I have been advised that there are two areas where recognition has been denied. The first is the exclusion of RAN eligibility for service afloat off Malaya between 1955 and 1960 in the veterans' entitlements legislation, imposed by the Menzies government, while the RAN was serving in Malaya in late 1956. The second is the refusal of the Navy Office to acknowledge RAN eligibility for the Naval General Service Medal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the exclusion from eligibility for repatriation benefits, it has been constantly stated by the navy that HMA ships were never allocated for operational service. However, a letter from the Department of the Navy to the Treasury of 11 November 1955 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The date on which RAN ships were allotted for duty as the RAN component of the Strategic Reserve was 1 July, 1955.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was well within the time period of which we are talking for these servicemen. There was other supporting evidence, which the government will well know of by now. This evidence was given to the Navy Office in late 1995, and I understand that it has disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Many statements have been given, and many retired service people have been involved in this discussion. I cannot think that such distinguished people as Admirals Peek, Hudson and Griffiths would lend their assistance to a cause which they did not believe was right and just. What they are asking for is very basic. I understand it will not cost the government huge amounts of money. It would be reasonable to think that these service people have been properly compensated for being away from their families and friends in service of their country. Time does not allow me to go into the full argument, but I believe that these people have been dealt a sad injustice. It is about time it was remedied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Apart from anything else, there should be a complete review of all the evidence and information collected by ex&hyphen;servicemen so they can have an opportunity to put their case to an independent arbitrator. There has been enough procrastination and inaction in this area, which I do not think is fair to our ex&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7979"> service personnel&mdash;even to our present personnel, as raised by my colleague in the preceding debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> At this stage there is overwhelming evidence to say that they were on active service when they were in the campaign, that they have a very good case to be recognised under the veterans' entitlements legislation and, further, that their efforts should be recognised with the Naval General Service Medal, the NGSM Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would ask the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) to recognise the issue. The minister has got herself into one of those <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> situations, where some of the paper pushing personnel have developed a head-in-the-sand sort of attitude to a difficult problem. It is not going to go away; this issue is going to stay on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and in the debate for ex&hyphen;servicemen and ex&hyphen;servicewomen for as long as it takes to be resolved. It is not fair to keep denying these servicemen the right to at least get some of the answers from those who can actually make the decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask that there be bipartisan support for this motion to go forward and that it be dealt with by the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan)&mdash;let him become involved and put his pressure to it&mdash;or Minister Bishop, the understudy, who is at the table.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) has moved this motion as it gives me a chance to highlight one of the most important initiatives contained in the government's 1997 budget. It is true that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 have not had access to benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 introduced by the previous Labor government, but that is about to change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to congratulate the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Hon. Bronwyn Bishop, who is at the table at the moment, and also the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Scott. The coalition's veterans' affairs policy statement issued prior to the federal election included a commitment to review perceived anomalies in veterans' entitlements for veterans who served in a number of overseas deployments since World War II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of a joint Defence and Veterans' Affairs review of 15 areas of overseas service, the government announced in the 1997 budget that compensation benefits would be extended to 12 new areas of overseas service. One of these new areas is indeed seagoing naval service with the Far East Strategic Reserve during the period 2 July 1955 to 27 May 1963 inclusive. In total, another 10,500 veterans will now be eligible for compensation in the form of disability pension, treatment for war-caused injury and illness, and a defence service home loan. The legislation providing for these benefits is currently before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the House not just recognise that compensation benefits have been provided but also recognise the very important service that the Far East Strategic Reserve veterans gave their country. The reserve was established in 1955 for the purpose of defending Malaya and Singapore and their surrounding waters. It was made up of an infantry brigade including both Australian and British troops, bomber and fighter squadrons and a carrier group to which Australian ships would be attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary role of the reserve was to defend Malaya during the course of the Malayan emergency against external communist aggression. Its secondary role was to assist in suppressing the communist insurrection within Malaya. The navy's contribution to the achievements of the reserve is highly regarded in the annals of history. They were an effective blockade and a powerful deterrent. Furthermore, on two occasions, Royal Australian Navy ships&mdash;HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anzac</EMPHASIS> on 29 September 1956 and HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queenborough</EMPHASIS> and HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quickmatch</EMPHASIS> on 22 January 1957&mdash;fired on suspected communist terrorist positions from off the coast of Jahore. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7980">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review to which I referred earlier found that naval service with the Far East Strategic Reserve did incur risk beyond that of normal peacetime conditions. Consequently, the service will be reclassified as `operational service' and compensation benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act will become available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There were many lessons for Australia from our participation in the Malayan emergency. The experience&mdash;a tragically costly one for the 36 Australians who lost their lives&mdash;emphasised the value of training, skills and discipline and the necessity of leadership. These qualities were all to be found amongst those who served within the Royal Australian Navy as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. There was another important outcome for Australia: Malaya, then as now an area of considerable concern to Australia in terms of security, survived the communist threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has honoured its promise and awarded the ASM clasp FESR to personnel who served with the Far East Strategic Reserve. The ALP failed to recognise these people while they were in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also take this opportunity to outline and recognise the other areas of overseas service which will be covered by the Veterans' Entitlements Act as a result of the government's review. They include service in the permanent defence force with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan during the period 3 January 1949 to 30 June 1951; RAAF service at Ubon air base in Thailand from 31 May 1962 to 31 August 1968; ADF personnel deployed to north-east Thailand over the period 31 May 1962 to 31 August 1968 for airfield construction work as part of our commitment to SEATO; and embassy guards and RAAF evacuation personnel who served in Vietnam between 12 January 1972 and 29 April 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other service in Singapore during the Malayan emergency, in the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea, in Vietnam prior to Australia's formal involvement and in United Nations sponsored activity in Korea, India, Pakistan, Lebanon and Cambodia will also now be covered. The process by which these anomalies in repatriation benefits have

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> condemns the Government for committing $1.3 billion to the International Monetary Fund rescue of the Thai economy without recourse to the Australian Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> calls on the Government to publish immediately all the details of the currency swap undertaken by the Reserve Bank; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> calls on the Government to freeze its undertaking pending a full parliamentary inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Australia's participation in the IMF rescue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Australia's contribution to the Thai currency swap was decided with undue haste and without consultation. The contribution which this government decided to make without consultation was also disproportionately large. Australia's $US1 billion contribution is overly generous when you consider it in context with Japan's contribution of $US4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Japanese economy is much bigger and much healthier than ours and Japan is purported to own over 40 per cent of Thailand's $US73 billion commercial foreign debt. Yet while the Japanese have so much at stake with their substantial involvement in the Thai economy, the very wealthy Japanese were only forthcoming with $US4 billion&mdash;almost nothing to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian parliament and the Australian people should have been consulted. However, now that this government has forced this decision on us all, it is incumbent on the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to make the terms and conditions of the swap clear and open to the scrutiny of the Australian people. Presumably, if the risk is carried by the Thai government and not by Australia, then Mr  Costello 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7981"> will be pleased to tell us this. The fact that the terms and conditions are secret cannot help but make Australians suspicious of the implications this deal poses for our country. The Australian people can only view this as either potential exposure to a large financial loss should the Thai currency suffer further devaluation, or, worse, the total write&hyphen;off of $1 billion should Thailand experience complete economic collapse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more you consider the lack of information and consultation relating to this matter, the more apparent it becomes that this is but another example of the complete lack of concern the Howard government has for the thoughts and wellbeing of the Australian people. As a matter of interest, Thailand will also be one of the countries seeking to export cooked chicken meat to Australia. Will we consider further job losses and the threat of disease for our own poultry industry as a little `thank you' for this loan?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the event of the Australian dollar collapsing&mdash;always a possibility, given this country's mismanagement&mdash;will the Thai government bail us out? You are now calling Australia's lemming&hyphen;like leap into the cell `the Thai bail&hyphen;out', but it is nothing but a pandering to the international elite. It accelerates the rush&mdash;so eagerly and deliriously pursued by politicians in successive Liberal and Labor governments over at least the last 25 years&mdash;to globalisation. What have you done to evaluate the allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the Thai economy? Do you even pretend to care about this issue?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In listening to that speech, I almost felt sorry for the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). Coming into the parliament, she obviously has a very unhappy day ahead. She wants to bag all our near neighbours and our best trading partners. She wants to bag the Australian government. She wants to try to frighten the Australian people with some fairly outrageous claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sort of prejudice that comes through in her speech concerns me greatly, because it shows she has no understanding of what is in Australia's best interests&mdash;let alone of what is in the interests of individual Australians. So, firstly, in the strongest possible terms, I totally reject the claims made in her speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We seemed to be listening to a speech that completely overlooked the fact that Thailand has been a long&hyphen;term friend of Australia. The Thais have had very close connections with Australia. Many Australians and Thais have developed lifetime friendships. To do nothing now would be a bit like saying to a neighbour when he is down, `What are we going to do? We will just kick you a bit harder and walk straight past.' I found it quite unbelievable, listening to the sort of drivel that came out of the member for Oxley. It showed a total lack of understanding of what this is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the brief time available I would like to point out that Australia is not doing this on its own. At the request of the International 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7982"> Monetary Fund, we are joining with a number of other countries. As part of this package we are joining with other good neighbours and friends in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. Clearly, that is very much in Australia's interests. To make one obvious point, Australia's exports to Thailand are now around $1.7 billion. Apart from the fact that we happen to live in the same region, we have a very direct interest in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth looking at the responses we have had from many different people. The opposition Treasury spokesman, Mr Evans&mdash;who is also a former Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;has made it very clear that he sees this as very much in Australia's best interests. We have bipartisan support for the very timely and very welcome decisions that have been made by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the government. As I say, I completely support what is being done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from helping the Thais, what this package also does is to send a very strong message to our region that Australia does care about its friends. At the same time, as I have said, it is an investment in the future and in the region's stability. Again, all of this is very much in Australia's interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give you a couple of brief quotes. The Thai Minister for Commerce, Dr Narongchai, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's contribution was big and Australia's policy towards Asia is very good.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Note that he said `towards Asia'. You might also like to know that Dr Narongchai studied at the University of Western Australia before going on to earn his economics doctorate at the Johns Hopkins University in the United States. His children have studied here too. In other words, we are talking about people who have very close connections with this country. We are not talking about people who are remote. We are talking about looking after and building on those friendships in the Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to quote the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). In a recent speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IMF package represents a win&hyphen;win situation for Thailand and for regional contributors including Australia. It is an investment in Thailand's future 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and in the region's economic stability and continuing growth. Economic stability in Thailand and the region is in the best interests of Australia's sizable export and investment presence in the region and it is also a responsibility which as a friend and neighbour we are happy to share.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As one commentator said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> , "In joining Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia . . . in the (baht) stabilisation program, Australia has done more for its regional credentials in one day's action in Tokyo than a year of blather from Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All of that is very strong stuff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind all honourable members of one other point: this is a currency swap. It is not a gift and it is not aid. Its terms are going to be negotiated by the Reserve Bank&mdash;and what body is better able to do something like that? It is going to have market related interest rates attached to it. Also, as has been pointed out, we expect that in due course the money will be repaid. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a government that was elected on the promise that it would raise parliamentary standards and make the government more accountable to the people. The problem is that here we have $1.3 billion worth of taxpayers' money committed to a rescue bailout without recourse to the parliament. The member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) may well be right; it may well have been in the best interests of Australia, but we do not know because we do not know what the conditions are and we do not even know the exact financial terms of the exchange interest rates that will be applied in this particular case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought, given the interest of the coalition before it got into government in trying to raise the scrutiny and accountability of government, that the least we could have done is have some sort of debate&mdash;even if we had had a ministerial statement with which we could debate this matter. Here we have a private member's motion where we have five minutes apiece to speak on it when we are dealing with $1.3 billion worth of taxpayers' money. Although that might well be safe at the end&mdash;we are not sure&mdash;it still represents a commitment of taxpayers' money to the rescue of the Thai economy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7983">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very seriously concerned about this because in a way it sends a message to the electorate that this is more  government by the detached elite style of government a la Keating in the last period of the Keating government. I urge the member for Wannon, who I know is a reasonable fellow, to read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The victory</EMPHASIS>, the book on the election campaign, where it made clear that when Mr Keating made this great and grandiose statement about the new defence pact he had negotiated with the president of Indonesia, it went down like a lead balloon in the electorate because the electorate saw it for what it was&mdash;an elitist arrangement made in secret between executive government and an overseas government without recourse to the parliament or the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the member for Wannon to merely argue that it is in our best interests and therefore we should accept it wholeheartedly without even knowing what the conditions are is, in my view, a derogation of his duty as a member of parliament and, in particular, a derogation of duty to his own constituents who are contributing to this rescue. His chicken farmers and those others who may be competing with Thai businesses may be interested to know whether or not the subsidy to the Thai economy will mean a net subsidy to businesses that are competing with Australian businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, it may well be in Australia's best interests to participate in the bailout but we just do not know because we have not been told. All we have merely been told is, `We know better than you; we are the government, we are smart and the people are ill-informed and too ignorant to debate this. Therefore, we will conduct this negotiation in secret, come to an arrangement and then we will slap it on to the taxpayers, as the member for Wannon has conceded, without knowing what the full terms of the bailout actually amount to.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank made the comment that there is insufficient financial data about the Thai economy with which to make those sorts of decisions. We seem to be placing ourselves as though we have a superior knowledge to that particular organisation. When the member for Wan 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> non says that the Reserve Bank is in an ideal position to negotiate the terms, we want to know what those terms will be, because there are a number of things we would like to see in relation to terms imposed on the Thais in relation to the bailout.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, for instance, let us have a look at the drug trafficking trade. Much of the heroin in Australia&mdash;this country is awash in heroin&mdash;comes from the Golden Triangle, of which Thailand is an integral part. I would have thought that one of the basic things we should be insisting upon as part of the rescue is a much more substantial clampdown on the heroin trade. I would have thought that that is absolutely basic. Here we have an enormous social problem, particularly amongst young people, and we have not even got the gumption to impose conditions when we are actually sending $1.3 billion worth of taxpayers' money to help out another economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) made some comments in relation to the Japanese interest. At the same time as the Japanese were putting together this IMF rescue, they were also going around the region promoting self-sufficiency in food production amongst the Asian nations. That is completely contrary to the interests of the member for Wannon's electorate, in particular, his rural producers. Yet at the same time we are imposing on ourselves this great cost without knowing what the conditions are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thailand is a friend of Australia but it has been ruled by a string of governments and suffered 17 coups and had 15 constitutions since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932. It is interesting that they are in the process of introducing another constitution. Almost simultaneously, we might have the sort of social unrest that may lead to the generals reimposing military authority in that country. These are the sorts of  elements that lead to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> making quite an apt comment in relation to the bailout. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's standing in the region will be strengthened by its involvement in the rescue attempt.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The appeal of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), albeit apparently waning in recent months, has been a reaction, I suspect, to the mismanagement over 13 years of the Labor government. However, we need to distinguish between listening to people's concerns and between ill-informed populism. While it is important&mdash;indeed, essential&mdash;for members of parliament to listen to their constituents, it is also the role of parliamentarians to lead, which means considering more than slogans and cliches, and sometimes it means swimming against the tide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley's motion expresses a fearful and xenophobic isolationism which Australia simply cannot afford. We cannot and must not shut Australia off from the rest of the world like some latter day Albania. For good or ill, Australia is part of the world community. We are not an Asian country; we have a singular status. We are a small people drawn from every corner of the world but with a strong Anglo-Saxon foundation. We are a piece of Europe in the Pacific, living cheek by jowl with Asia, the fastest growing economic region in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point about this motion is that we are not giving Thailand $1.35 billion to prop up its haemorrhaging economy at all. We are taking part in a currency swap. The money comes from foreign reserves already held in the Reserve Bank, which will transfer money held at present in some other form, such as US treasury bonds. Thailand agrees to swap the currencies back as conditions permit over the next three to five years. The transaction is made at no cost to the Australian taxpayer and may never even be called in. It is there to give confidence to the Thai currency, which will help all Australian exporters, including our farmers. The risk involved here is therefore very small.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to understand that the bailout of Thailand, to the tune of $US14 billion&mdash;of which Japan contributed $4 billion; Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore $1 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> billion each; and Indonesia and South Korea $500 million each&mdash;is attached to a rigorous IMF plan for economic reform of the Thai economy. The money converted to baht to shore up the Thai exchange rate by these countries is entirely conditional on Thailand adhering to the IMF plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Thai government has agreed to stringent demands to slash government spending, to raise consumer taxes and to set targets for cutting inflation and its trade deficit. Before the bailout, the baht had lost 26 per cent of its value since 2 July when the government stopped pegging it to the United States dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The crisis immediately began to spread to other countries in the region, prompting a slump on the Malaysian stock exchange and falls in Malaysian and Philippine currencies. The Thai economy had simply become overheated. Such a complete financial debacle experienced by a country in the region would have caused economic shock waves around the Pacific rim. It is likely that it would have caused a domino effect in neighbouring states and would have had a major impact on Australia itself. Australia could not contemplate such a tidal wave without taking pre-emptive action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IMF was set up after the Second World War for precisely these reasons. So Australia had very precise economic reasons in its own interests for being a party to the Thailand bailout. Thailand bought Australian goods worth $1.7 billion last year and is an increasingly important trade partner with this country. Australian companies have massive investments in a broad range of industries in Thailand, with annual trade earnings of $600 million a year. Australia's goods and services exports to ASEAN nations last year totalled $15.68 billion&mdash;of which Thailand's share was $2.1 billion. Australia's investment in ASEAN countries to mid-1996 was $9.25 billion&mdash;or 6.1 per cent of Australia's investment abroad. So this is something which is quite clearly in the interests of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rescue package alone will not solve Thailand's problems as it has moved too slowly, unlike some of the other Asian countries, to ensure that its economy is on a sound footing. But this episode does show us that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7985"> even Asian tigers sometimes need a visit from paramedics. We should be a significant part of the infusion being given to the Thai economy because it will give us a leverage in the region&mdash;a leverage which is important, and much more important than all the rhetoric we could speak about having a place in the fastest growing economic region in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By helping Thailand, we will have helped ourselves. To suggest otherwise is to be sadly blinkered and uninformed about the real benefits to all Australians from being an active part of the IMF bailout. As John Maynard Keynes, who was involved in the setting up of the IMF, noted:</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nation's ecological, social and economic resources.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One of the most significant issues facing both developing and developed societies is the management of population growth. This is necessary so we do not see ecological environmental deterioration, the over&hyphen;exploitation of natural resources and the human exploitation that accompanies natural resource degradation, for example, poverty, illiteracy and underemployment. Our aim must be balanced and sustainable development globally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last 10 years, we have seen a number of nations co-operate in addressing population development problems. Added to the issues of how best to achieve balanced and sustainable development has been the new terror of the late 20th century&mdash;how to halt the spread of HIV infections and AIDS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second week of July this year, a group of New Zealand and Australian parliamentarians, led by the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), had the privilege of travelling to Thailand and Vietnam to evaluate how those countries are improving the reproductive health of their women, how they are implementing national population policy goals in relationship to their reproductive health and, in particular, how they are lowering their birth rates. As well, in Thailand, we reviewed that country's efforts to halt the spread of HIV and AIDS with the assistance of Australian support and funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We visited and were hugely impressed with the AusAID project at the Bamrasnaradura Hospital in Bangkok. This receives technical support from the Albion Street Centre of Sydney and it is helping to establish an ambulatory care project to enable AIDS sufferers to live at home while receiving some specialised treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot underestimate the enormous task Thailand now faces&mdash;the challenge of assisting, in particular, its northern hill tribes to become economically independent, with the burden of so much of the HIV problem now focused in that region. We were told about the orphans created by the AIDS scourge, the generation gap, where a whole generation of primary income earners are now missing, or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7986"> facing full&hyphen;blown AIDS in the future. We learned about the problems of a nation looking at how best to assist the people where, in remote areas, not even the fundamentals of health care are provided. That is something we took away with us. We were concerned and at the same time challenged by the fact that those people have so far to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We wish to acknowledge the dedication and outstanding work of the Population and Community Development Association of Thailand. The PCDA have worked, first, towards lowering birth rates. They have been most effective there by ensuring that in their country it is now commonplace for families to discuss contraception. At the same time, they are moving on and understanding that together with contraception&mdash;an issue now well understood&mdash;they must look at the reproductive health issues, such as HIV&hyphen;AIDS and other related illnesses like hepatitis B and C, which are other major factors in the reproductive health of their communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were so pleased to see the hard work of our NGOs in Thailand. They are working to make sure that, in particular, the economic needs of the least advantaged in Thailand are met so that they can become independent and more in control of their everyday lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Vietnam we were taken to communes&mdash;small community groups where the women in particular had been supported by a loan system that Australia had helped fund. These young women had become more economically independent with loans which were perhaps as little as $US100. The women we were able to talk to were establishing education programs for themselves and their children, and they were addressing reproductive health issues to ensure that their families would not live in poverty and become victims of a lack of information about contraception and easily preventable communicable diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly wish to acknowledge and commend the work of the Vietnam Association of Parliamentarians on Population and Development and the National Committee for Population and Family Planning, which was established in Vietnam in 1984. We went to their women's union project in the Ninh Binh province. We were impressed with the way 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those small communities are now becoming empowered through often very small amounts of aid but also through their desire to ensure that their children enjoy a quality of life much better than they had experienced in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we visited the hospital in Ho Chi Minh City and saw the young children, whose parents had been exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, none of us could feel anything but awe at the enormous challenge faced by a country with over one million children intellectually and/or physically handicapped as a result of this exposure. I was particularly struck by the request of one of their parliamentarians who asked, `Could we not share some data on the families of Vietnam War veterans so that we could compare and see what the health outcomes were for the families of those veterans?' We need to make sure that with our combined information and understanding we do our very best to ensure that the disabled population is helped to reach its full potential, and we need to understand better what the impact of that sort of chemical is on human life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we travelled in Vietnam we were particularly struck by the enormous energy of that government as it tries to tackle at the same time population planning, reproductive health issues and economic development. We were struck by the fact that there was an outright willingness to embrace change, despite their understanding of the long road ahead. There was, in every sense, a sharing of the task that extended from overseas aid agencies, NGOs and included their regional neighbours. The Vietnamese government is making sure that its population understands that its future development depends on constraining the numbers of children born to each family, even when they still have a strong cultural preference for sons. We were impressed that the two-child family policy was being achieved despite generations of concern that a son is born to each family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I came away from Vietnam and Thailand most concerned that our own population policies have been ad hoc for decades in the sense that each year we make decisions about immigration numbers, for example based on the economic issues of the day, rather than on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7987"> some long&hyphen;term planning policy, which includes consideration of the natural resources, and decisions about the quality of life that we wish to see in generations to come. I was struck by how these two countries&mdash;Vietnam and Thailand&mdash;are tackling the very critical task of determining population policy in the long term, even though very hard decisions have to be made right now with families who would prefer to have more than one or two children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that Australia has much to contribute to population development and planning issues in the region. We have already addressed the issue of being a nation with a very fragile geological and hydrological environment. Our resources are limited in terms of our ability to have an ever increasing population. Our birthrate already is low. We can do so much in other nations in relation to teaching them about managing reproductive health issues. We can pass on information about how we have managed to contain HIV and AIDS to an extent that is the envy of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I felt a great deal of respect for the work being done in Vietnam and Thailand and for the Australians assisting over there. I felt that the aid dollars that we have contributed have done an enormous amount to bond our three nations together in achieving a better future for the world in terms of proper population planning.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion moved by the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) and I congratulate her for bringing this important debate to the chamber. It was interesting that this debate follows the discussion about the appropriateness or not of Australia contributing to a bail&hyphen;out of the Thai economy. While everyone has their own views on that, I happen to think it was the correct thing to do. Australia is also making a contribution in many ways to the wellbeing and the health of the people of Thailand which, in turn, will hopefully help with the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often difficult for us in Australia to appreciate the enormity of the population problem in so many parts of the world, especially in Thailand and Vietnam. It is also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very difficult for us to appreciate the challenges that the governments and the peoples of these countries face. It is difficult because of the population differences, if for no other reason. Thailand has a population of 60,271,000, Vietnam has a population of almost 75 million and Australia has a population of around 18 million people. The interesting thing about Vietnam and Thailand is that both are basically young countries&mdash;the people are very young. The birthrates have not yet peaked. Countries like Australia and Japan are talking of a declining population in a few years time. These countries have yet to reach their peak in population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the other speakers in this debate, I recently visited Thailand and Vietnam to see at first hand how they are dealing with these population issues. The trip was ably led by the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), and I pay tribute to her leadership. Obviously the question of HIV&hyphen;AIDS was discussed and we saw several programs, especially programs where Australia has made a contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For each of us on that trip, there will be a different highlight, and for me one of the most impressive aspects of the visit was visiting the Royal Inthanon Agriculture Station and the hill tribes outside Chiang Mai. This was especially important as this was a poppy growing area not so long ago. The hill tribes are now growing fruit and vegetables rather than poppies and thus are no longer contributing to the opium trade of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important that the hill tribes there, as part of a scheme which is under the patronage of His Majesty the King, are also receiving health care and are discussing population issues. Just as their own health is improving in that area, so indeed, by their no longer growing poppies and adding to the opium trade, is the health of the world so much improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess that no&hyphen;one who visits Thailand and meets Mechai, of cabbages and condoms fame, can fail to be impressed not only by his remarkable vigour but also by his vision. He has been awarded the Order of Australia and has had close connections with Australia, having attended Geelong Grammar School and Melbourne University, from which he has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7988"> a degree. He has also received many other awards for his work in family planning. His innovative approach to sex education is perhaps something that we here in Australia can learn from. It uses not only high profile people but also hundreds of workers throughout Thailand who are doing so much to make health planning and healthy, useful lifestyles a reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The campaign of Mechai to promote the use of condoms has helped to significantly reduce sexually transmitted diseases, thereby preventing the spread of AIDS. But the battle is far from won. The World Health Organisation estimates that almost 20 million people worldwide have been infected with HIV, the virus that causes the disease. Thailand has recorded more than 13,000 cases of AIDS since 1979. WHO says the virus is spreading fastest in South and South&hyphen;East Asia. Since 1993, HIV infections in the region have doubled to three million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mechai believes that Asia has yet to feel the full force of this epidemic. He predicts that AIDS will soon be more prevalent in Asia than it is in Africa, where an estimated 11 million people are HIV carriers. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thailand is being hurt but because the country has an advanced AIDS awareness program it won't be hurt as badly as some other countries in the sub&hyphen;continent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So he continues that work, and he continues the work to involve businesses in rural development and the work towards sex education in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the 20th century, Thailand underwent a rapid increase in the rate of population growth. From a population estimated at the time of the first census in 1911 to be eight million people, Thailand now has nearly 60 million people, and that population is increasing all the time. It was very interesting for me, as a male there on that trip, to see that family planning in both Vietnam and Thailand was not regarded as purely an issue for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vasectomy is now widespread in Thailand. A few years ago there was no vasectomy at all, and that was very much because of the misunderstanding of the males as to the actual meaning of the procedure. During that time it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is estimated that only a few hundred vasectomies occurred each year, but now many thousands of vasectomies are carried out every year. Although I and the other male member of the group were invited to participate in this, we actually declined the kind offer that was made to us. The other important aspect is a coordinating role that Thailand plays in this part of the world. Having been more advanced in this area than other countries, it is now giving its expertise to many other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vietnam, in the past two decades, has succeeded in achieving a high rate of economic growth and it also has experienced a significant decline in population growth and fertility. But Vietnam still has severe problems in this area. We were very privileged while we were there to visit one particular project. We visited many projects in which there was Australian involvement, but one that particularly impressed me was one where the women are taught economic management. In that way they have a bank and, by being freed from economic constraints, they invest more and more. Family Planning Australia was very involved in this project, and it shows what can be achieved. We saw examples of chicken rearing and various aspects like that. You do not have to have a great, grandiose plan&mdash;you can go in there with a very simple idea and a simple plan. Not only are they learning economic management; they are also learning aspects of health and reproductive health. So that is very important for the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been mentioned, we have in this parliament an all&hyphen;party group on population and development, of which I am pleased to be a member. This group acts to bring issues of population and development before the parliament. We recognise the need for a population policy not only in Australia but also in many other countries whose problems in this field are so much greater than Australia's. It is important that this group acts as a forum to visitors to Parliament House. We also work very closely with the Reproductive Health Alliance and Family Planning Australia. I would suggest to honourable members that they consider joining that group, if they are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7989"> not already a member, and from that they can learn much about the issues of population as they apply to Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the motion of the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) and also add to some of the comments made by the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) on our recent parliamentary visit to Thailand and Vietnam, led by the member for Adelaide, Trish Worth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trip was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, and other groups that were involved were the Australian Reproductive Alliance and the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development, also known as the AFPPD. The role of these organisations is to develop cooperation and support of parliamentarians in the area of population and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The objective of the AFPPD was to educate and inform members of parliament on issues such as reproductive health and family planning in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. A further objective was to determine population planning according to individual countries' needs. The AFPPD receives support from AusAID, the Rockefeller Foundation and many other agencies. Exchanges of parliamentarians occur both on an inter&hyphen;region level as well as on an international level to provide this first&hyphen;hand knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main focus of the trip was to study AIDS and population related issues. In Thailand, we visited the Bamrasmaradura Hospital, which is an AusAID ambulatory project and care program. The project involves great technical support from the Albion Street Centre in Sydney. It provides a service for people living with AIDS at home to visit the hospital and to receive medical treatment as part of this process as they require it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AIDS is probably one of the most serious problems faced by Thailand. By the year 2000 it is estimated that some three to four million people will be infected by the HIV&hyphen;AIDS virus. If these projections are accurate, one in three deaths will be caused by AIDS and the mortality rate due to AIDS will be the leading cause of death, particularly among infants and the young age groups. AIDS is spreading 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rapidly among different population groups, including adolescents and pregnant women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were very privileged to meet Mechai Viravaidya, who is the Chairman of the Population and Community Development Association. He was quite a dynamic man. His first job was with the government's national planning agency. He resolved to do something very concrete about Thailand's huge population growth, which at that stage was 3.2 per cent per annum. In 1978, he introduced some very spirited campaigns on family planning, which the member for Throsby was speaking about earlier. Today Thailand's population growth remains at its 1991 level, which is just over one per cent, and it is a really successful model for some of the developing countries in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years, Mechai has also established the Thai Business Initiative in Rural Development, known as T BIRD. This is a project which assists the migration of poor villagers, particularly women, to urban areas and prevents them from becoming involved in areas such as prostitution, which was the only avenue that was open to them in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The war against AIDS is far from over. In fact, the World Health Organisation estimates that there will be some 20 million people world&hyphen;wide who have been infected by HIV. We were also very privileged to visit the communicable disease centre, the Aidsnet Foundation, where there is a community five&hyphen;year national AIDS prevention and control program occurring. The Doi Saked Hospital and the family planning northern project in Northern Thailand were also visited, as were the hill tribe people in northern Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1988 the family planning northern project began providing health services to villages in Chiang Mai, Lamphun, Mae Hong Son and Chiang Rai provinces. Today, some 180 main and 530 satellite villages are covered by this program. A great deal of work is being done by NGOs in this area, and they are to be admired for the great work that they have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most fulfilling part of the trip was to see young children being treated for health problems. These children would not have had access to any health services and their quality 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7990"> of life would have been significantly reduced. Great progress has be been made here, particularly with agriculture and self&hyphen;sufficiency in this particular project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our group's visit to Vietnam included a visit to Ho Chi Minh City, which left me with some very deep impressions and emotions that I will never forget. The saddest part of this trip for me was to visit the children with birth defects at the Tu Pu Gynaecological Hospital. The effects of agent orange are still devastatingly obvious, and the whole ward of the hospital was devoted to young babies with limbs missing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One baby I will always remember had no arms from the elbows and no legs&mdash;just a torso, and the most beautiful face that one would imagine. My heart felt heavy with this injustice, and as a mother I can only imagine what pain he will endure for the rest of his life.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, I was extremely proud as an Australian member of the delegation to see first&hyphen;hand how well spent our Australian aid dollars are. Empowerment is the word. When you talk to these people and you go out into the villages, whether it be in Chiang Mai or Chiang Rai province in the north of Thailand or whether it be in the provinces out of Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, you see very distinct examples of when you are able to give the people in these areas the rare dollar&mdash;and it is rare to them&mdash;and you can see the huge advantages that they can then make from that money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw the effects of our aid dollar in hospitals, when I saw nursing sisters stand back, point to what looked to me to be a fairly old humidicrib and say, with pride written all over them, `This came from your country. You helped us purchase this equipment.' In very basic conditions, those very basic facilities were clean, well tended and well staffed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been helping with training, we have been helping with equipment and facilities, we have been helping with building an infrastructure and we have been assisting and guiding these people to actually empower themselves. They know better than we do what they need in their countries, but what we know and what we agree with them over is one thing: they need sanitation, they need clean water, and they need to know that they can have confidence in their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to think that we can continue to spend our aid dollars well in both Thailand and Vietnam&mdash;particularly Vietnam, which is a very poor country. We were one of the first countries, if not the first country, to re-enter a bilateral aid program with Vietnam, and I am very proud of that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Chief Justice of the High Court saw fit recently to castigate the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) for not mounting a defence of the High Court in the face of public criticisms of it by some politicians. By choosing to make his own views public, it strikes me that the Chief Justice has applied interesting standards. One criterion is that he can justifiably criticise the political processes, including the Attorney-General's reluctance to speak out on the court's behalf, if indeed that was the Attorney-General's decision. Effectively, while a member of the High Court would not speak out publicly about the judgment of a colleague or colleagues, by some hitherto unknown to me convention, the Attorney-General is somehow bound to publicly disown the expressed opinions of his ministerial colleagues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stress the public nature of the recent exchanges between the judiciary and members

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ling record of the government on jobs 18 months into office, the halfway mark of a full parliamentary term. The unemployment figures for August released over the last 10 days show just how shocking this record is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Howard government's first 18 months, the unemployment rate has shot up by 0.3 percentage points, from 8.4 to 8.7 per cent. More importantly, in the Howard government's first 18 months, total employment has risen by just 46,900, and the number of full&hyphen;time jobs has actually fallen by an incredible 21,000. In sharp contrast, in the last 18 months of the last Labor government, total employment rose by 393,700, and the number of full&hyphen;time jobs rose by 242,100.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, in August 1997 the number of long-term unemployed in Australia jumped to a 28&hyphen;month high of 247,700. It is also interesting to note that the number of unemployed has risen every single month since May 1996, when the government started cutting Labor's jobs programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also mention that, since the Howard government's first budget in August of last year, almost 60,000 full&hyphen;time jobs have been lost in Australia&mdash;not an insignificant figure: 60,000 full&hyphen;time jobs have gone in 12 months.

This inquiry is into the leadership style of a squadron leader in the RAAF who is in charge of the only continuously operational unit in the RAAF, that is, the P3 Orion detachment at Butterworth that conducts patrols into the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean. He was in command of a handful of men, all members of the military, and there appears to have been a personality dispute.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House records its deep sadness at the death, on 5 September 1997, of Mother Teresa, the former head of the Missionaries of Charity and expresses its deep sympathy to the members of the Society of the Missionaries of Charity order and the people of India in their bereavement, and requests that this motion be conveyed by the Speaker on behalf of the House to the Government of India, the Holy See and to Sister Nirmala Joshi, the Superior General of the Missionaries of Charity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When I learned of the death of Mother Teresa, I said that I could think of no&hyphen;one in my life who more completely exemplified the Christian ideal of sacrifice and service than the late Mother Teresa. It really is, in a condolence motion such as this, difficult to summon appropriate words to accurately, fulsomely and appropriately describe the life of someone who, in all but title, is undeniably a saint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mother Teresa was a woman who dedicated her entire life to looking after the poor, the sick, the wretched, the abandoned, the ignored and the neglected who were in the most appalling physical condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole world mourned the passing of Mother Teresa. Her legendary work touched the lives of many thousands of people and she was an inspiration to millions around the world. Her work, of course, went beyond the admiration and the boundaries of world Catholicism, but she was, without question, a shining demonstration of Catholic life and a person who brought immense pride and immense dignity to the Catholic Church 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7995"> throughout the world. Many have remarked that perhaps no person this century has made a greater contribution to Catholic life in its purest form than Mother Teresa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great virtues of Mother Teresa was the consistency with which she valued human life. She gave voice, she gave hope and she gave comfort to the most downtrodden people in the world: the orphans, the lepers, those suffering from terminal illnesses, AIDS sufferers, battered women, drug addicts and the unborn. Her valiance was in fighting for the very sanctity of human life as she saw it. She drew no distinction between the standard of one life and another, yet deeply valued the individual quality of every human life she encountered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What set her apart from many who perform great works was that she chose the way of life from which many were perceived to suffer. For her, poverty was her chosen way of life, that she might be closer to those she served and to the God that she sought to serve throughout her entire life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Added to her vows that the religious take of poverty, chastity and obedience was Mother Teresa's promise of wholehearted, free service to the poorest of the poor. It can truly be said that her life confirmed the scripture passage of Matthew 19:30:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As we mark the life of Mother Teresa and as we pay tribute to her tremendous years of service and the great model that she was of Christian commitment, I think it is also an opportunity to pay tribute to those who seek to serve their God in religious vocations. Theirs is a unique, a very special and a very valuable lifestyle, and those who have chosen religious vocations have contributed enormously to the development of Australia and have, in their different ways, moulded the lives and the attitudes of millions of Australians over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we mark her death, as we thank God for her life and as we pay tribute to the tremendous Christian service of her life, I think it is also&mdash;in a representative sense&mdash;an opportunity to pay tribute to the religious and to those who seek a religious vocation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mother Teresa was born in 1910 of Albanian parents at Skopje in central Europe. She was just 17 when she travelled to Ireland to join the Sisters of Loreto and, after staying in Dublin for less than a year, she was posted to the Loreto Convent in the city of Darjeeling in north&hyphen;east India. She became the principal of St Mary's, a school for girls, and stayed there for 19 years. It was during this period that she took the name of `Teresa', after Little Teresa of Lisieux.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The year 1946 was a turning point in this most remarkable life when she decided to leave the convent and live among the poor. It took two years but Mother Teresa, undaunted, was finally granted permission to live as an independent nun in 1948. The following year she became an Indian citizen. She opened her first school in the slums of Calcutta in 1949&mdash;almost 50 years ago. From these humble beginnings, her work and her simple message have been heard around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Officially recognised by Rome as the Society of the Missionaries of Charity in 1950, the organisation she founded now has 45 houses in more than 100 countries, including Australia. Her order has opened schools, orphanages, hospices for the dying and hostels for those afflicted with leprosy or AIDS. She has won many international recognitions, including the Order of Australia. She will be remembered by Australians because of her Missionaries of Charity order, which has established missions in Sydney, Melbourne, Queanbeyan, Bourke, Orange, Dareton, Wagga Wagga, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Darwin. She visited Australia half a dozen times and, in January 1982, she was appointed an Honorary Companion in the Order of Australia for services to the Australian community and to humanity at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mother Teresa was, in all senses of the word, a remarkable human being. She dedicated her life to the service and to the caring of others. She lived out the Christian ideal in a way that none of us in this House could ever hope to do. She was a shining example that faith, individual commitment and personal sacrifice in the service of others can still be the most powerful force in the world and can 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7996"> do more to ennoble individuals and the human race than any other kind of endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of those within the government, on behalf of all the members of this parliament and indeed on behalf of the broader Australian community we pay tribute to a wonderful woman, a true servant of the God that she loved throughout her entire life, a person whose entire being was dedicated to the service of suffering humanity and somebody who, in all but name, is in every sense of the word a true saint.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the expressions of sympathy that he extended to the Missionaries of Charity in all their branches across the globe, to the people of India, to the government of India and to people of the Catholic faith who have watched, observed, taken comfort in and drawn lessons from the wonderful life of Mother Teresa and the wonderful example that she set, as the Prime Minister pointed out, of Christian life and Christian objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Her life was one deeply honoured in its latter years. Looking at the remarks that might have been made here on this occasion, and drawing from them to place on the record from this parliament Australia's sentiments of sorrow and loss at her death, there are many you could choose to quote from. They are statements of the powerful and the powerful honoured her. President Clinton, for example, described her as `one of the giants of our time' who `showed us the stunning power of simple humility'. President Reagan, when he awarded her the presidential Medal of Freedom, described her as a `heroine of our times' and a `saint of the gutters'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been honours extended from our system of honours that the Prime Minister referred to, as well as honours from many other countries across the globe. One cannot help but think, however, that all these just washed over her. She remained, throughout her life, a person of humble faith. A person of deep belief in the Catholic church and in her mission associated with the Catholic church, she believed that everything that came to her was something to advance the causes 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for which she stood. Everything that she had was to be used to support her mission; every piece of recognition was to be used to support her mission. As the President of the United States said, Mother Teresa showed us all the stunning power of simple humility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot help but think, though, what exactly it was that we were making a statement about through all of those honours. I can say `we' because we in Australia extended some of those honours to her. There cannot be any doubt at all that the most notable feature of her life was that she was, if you like, counter the 20th century. She was counter the evil of this century, which has seen the most horrendous human bloodbaths, which has seen the most appalling examples of human neglect, and which has seen the most vicious and savage political ideologies extend their sway beyond narrow borders to very substantial parts of the globe. Mother Teresa stood out against all that in her simplicity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She was aware, throughout, of the possibilities of being used or misused and the possibilities of being introduced to agendas that she did not share because her mission was so simple. One of her critics suggested to her once that she could do more for the world by teaching people how to fish rather than giving them fish. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people I serve are helpless. They cannot stand. They cannot hold the rod. I will give them the food and then send them to you so you can teach them how to fish.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She said too, at another time, of her mission:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The biggest disease today is not leprosy or tuberculosis, but rather the feeling of being unwanted, uncared for and deserted by everybody. The greatest evil is the lack of love and charity, the terrible indifference toward one's neighbour who lives at the roadside, assaulted by exploitation, corruption, poverty and disease.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was that profound conviction, when she herself was recovering from an illness, which changed her from being one of the magnificent Catholic educators in India at the time and since into being a simple person of the streets, picking up those from the streets, and giving succour and comfort to the most terribly affected proportion of our humanity. As Cardinal Clancy said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7997">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Her moral influence world&hyphen;wide . . . was in inverse proportion to her physical stature . . . (she) . . . was universally admired and revered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Her greatest commitment was to the poorest of the poor (those in the streets of Calcutta) and the `lowest' of humanity&mdash;the lonely, the abandoned, the homeless, the disease&hyphen;ravaged and the dying.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She never lost that commitment throughout her life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A friend of mine, the Reverend Keith Dowding, who is the father of a former Western Australian Labor premier, actually worked near Mother Teresa in Calcutta between 1963 and 1965. He was concerned with a mission to a number of refugees. He sent a note to me, in which he said of her:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been said about some of the great reformers that they loved humanity but could not stand people. That does not apply to Mother Teresa. She certainly loved humanity, but she loved people&mdash;loved each person with a total commitment. She embraced humanity metaphorically. She also embraced the poor and the wretched, the filthy and the repulsive&mdash;embraced them physically. Each person mattered to her&mdash;the newborn baby found in a rubbish bin, the leper chased away with stones from a food queue and the old man dying in the squalor of a slum gutter. I saw with near incredulity the loving care she gave to the lonely and the neglected children she cared for in her children's home, the gentleness and warmth which she and her nuns gave to the old ones she took to her home for the dying.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When Sidney Carter, of Lord of the Dance, saw old men picked out of the gutter and taken to a place where they could die surrounded by love, he wrote these lines:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No revolution will come in time to alter this man's life, except the one's surprise of being loved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He only has 12 more hours to live,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">so never mind about a cure for cancer, smoking, leprosy or osteo&hyphen;arthritis. Over this dead loss to society you pour your precious ointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You wash the feet that will not walk tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Reverend Dowding concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mother Teresa knew that there were people working for social justice who criticised her work because, they claimed, she did nothing to change the structures of a society that produced poverty and misery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Her response was that there were people and powerful organisations working to reform society. Meantime there were millions who need succour, and she was committed to giving that succour. She 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> knew that she was, as some alleged, merely providing a sort of ambulance service; but it was a necessary service and it was inspired by an unqualified love.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She has inspired many to follow her. She tried, for a very brief period of time, to resign her responsibilities in that regard, and she was re-elected unanimously to that position that she held by her order. She was a person who had come to symbolise that basic decency, that wonderful Christian commitment that her order had managed to establish under her direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best thing I can do is to conclude, again with Cardinal Clancy, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mother Teresa has now left us, and we shall see her tiny white&hyphen;robed figure no more. But in a sense she has not left us. She will live on among us in her example and her inspiration, and above all in the thousands of her sisters spread throughout the world, preserving her spirit, and continuing her joyful service of the poor.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We in this parliament salute her memory. We in this parliament salute the work that she has done. We in this parliament acknowledge the enormous contribution, as the Prime Minister has said, which she has made to decency, civility, warmth and succour in our society. We acknowledge, too, that these characteristics are not necessarily reflective of political systems. For the world to actually provide a place for all those who are suffering, it is necessary for some people in this world to stand aside from all the normal processes and simply commit themselves devotedly and unreservedly to that task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not part of that, but those who are provide the sort of society that makes life worth living. The occasions come, from time to time, to recognise that, and unfortunately this is one of them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a privilege to support this special motion for Mother Teresa and to highlight four particular awards which are deserving of special comment on her wonderful life. In 1971, his then Holiness Pope John XXIII gave her special recognition with the award of the Pope John Peace Prize. That award signifies that the reports over the years of a rift between the Vatican and the work of Mother Teresa were absolutely 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7998"> inaccurate. Indeed, the commendation of her work by Pope John XXIII was replicated by other popes through to His Holiness Pope John Paul II.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a privilege, on behalf of the Australian government and the people of Australia, to attend at Castel Gondolfo on Saturday, 13 September, just after her funeral, and convey direct to the Pope our salute of her work and to hear his recognition of that work yet again, something which he has been unswerving of during the period of his papacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second award was the Nobel Peace Prize, in 1979. That reflected the international accolades of an assessment panel which is quite comprehensive in its approach, and it was very deserving at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1980, the Indian government awarded Mother Teresa the highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna. The thing about that award is that the government of the people of India, with the wide diversity of religion in India&mdash;including Hindu, Muslim and Christian&mdash;stepped forward to give its highest civilian award in recognition of the work of Mother Teresa. That was replicated by the state funeral provided in Calcutta for Mother Teresa. It speaks volumes for her work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in 1982, the then coalition government of Malcolm Fraser, Doug Anthony and John Howard, and others, recognised in that period, through the Order of Australia Council, the work of Mother Teresa in Australia and the world. In that particular year, Mother Teresa went to Beirut to help rescue Lebanese children from the civil war that was unfolding at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me add my salute to the huge work of the Missionaries of Charity in 67 countries around the world, which has 4,000 nuns and 40,000 lay workers all helping to support millions of people across the world who are suffering so greatly from poverty and from the hardships of disease and other difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1959 here in Australia, in Bourke, the first Missionaries of Charity convent was established. Today at Bourke, as the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) reminds me, there are four nuns&mdash;Sister Isabelle, Sister Hannahria, Sister Amlia and Sister Prakashita&mdash;who work 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in carrying out a hostel for homeless men and a day care service, who visit Aboriginal communities and teach catechisms at Bourke and Enngonia. That work is replicated at Katherine, Darwin, Tennant Creek, Queanbeyan, Sydney, Wagga Wagga, Mildura and Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to join with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in saluting the work of this extraordinary lady. It gives you some hope for the 21st century that a lady born in eastern Europe of very common means, in great hardship, could subsequently have moved to carry out her work in India and could so dominate the landscape of the world that, upon her passing, governments worldwide, parliaments worldwide, acknowledged this and many leaders travelled to India on the occasion of her funeral in Calcutta last Saturday week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The story of Mother Teresa is well summed up by the words of his Excellency the Governor-General in a condolence motion to the President of India, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Her life and example will continue as a beacon of light and hope both to those who are suffering and to those who seek to help them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 4 September the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) asked me about anticipation of debate, particularly in relation to questions. Standing order 144, which sets out the rules for questions, concludes by stating:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Questions cannot anticipate discussion upon an order of the day or other matter.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As indicated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>  on page 512, there can be some difficulty in some circumstances in applying the anticipation convention, and I believe the difficulty frequently arises from the prohibition on questions anticipating discussion on `other matters'. However, the cardinal rule, as also indicated on page 512 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> , is simple: questions should avoid the anticipation of discussion of orders of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frequently, although a matter of public importance has been submitted, a member may ask a question on that subject which clearly anticipates discussion on that matter. A strict application of the standing order would rule such questions out of order, but I propose to continue to allow them. A question may be asked on the same subject matter as that contained in a bill, but it should not anticipate discussion on an order of the day relating to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A notice of intention to do something is different from an order of the day. A notice may or may not be carried out. Further, the specifics on the subject matter of a notice are not known until the member has made a speech relating to it. This is especially so in relation to a bill. The details of a motion appearing in full on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> may be a different matter. I repeat: members should avoid discussion at length on an order of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Standing order 82 relates more generally to anticipation of debate and this may lead to some confusion. The member for Hotham, in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> raising the matter with me on 4 September, quoted from the segment of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> relating to standing order 82. The conventions and practices of the House vest in the chair a discretion in these matters. That discretion was extended, I understand, by the chair later on 4 September when a member, in speaking to a motion to refer the proposed changes contained in the  Native Title Amendment Bill to a parliamentary committee, may have been viewed as anticipating the adjourned second reading debate on the bill which had just been introduced. No objection was raised at that time. I do believe that the member for Hotham was present. In my view, the exercise of the chair's discretion on that occasion was appropriate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Stirling for his question. This afternoon the Minister for Foreign Affairs will announce the appointment of Ms Meg McDonald as Australia's new roving environmental ambassador. She will have a leading role in arguing Australia's case in international negotiations on climate change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take the opportunity of saying a few things about the national interest so far as greenhouse gas emissions are concerned. I commend to those Labor members opposite who represent coalmining constituencies in Australia to listen rather carefully to the reality of what is involved in this particular issue. I was fascinated at the weekend to see some of the remarks of the Premier of New South Wales. He apparently thinks we should be out there agreeing with what the Europeans want at the forthcoming Kyoto summit. I wonder if he will have the guts to go to Newcastle and tell the people of the Hunter Valley just where he stands on this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it clear at the very outset that this is an issue that very directly affects Australia's national interest. Those who argue that we should be taking a more pro-European stance, those who argue like the Labor Party that we should roll over in the face of international pressure, those who argue that we should give in to the most extreme view on this issue are completely ignoring the very drastic consequences that this country would suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the European Union is arguing for a 15 per cent reduction by the year 2010 in relation to the 1990 level of greenhouse gas emissions. My government&mdash;and I would hope all Australians who study this issue&mdash;cannot possibly accept the approach adopted by the Europeans. They would discriminate that approach against Australia because they would have a much harsher impact on the Australian economy than other economies.</PARA>

Your mate from Kingsford&hyphen;Smith wanted us to roll over to the Europeans on the human rights convention, and you want us to roll over to the Europeans on this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to tell the constituencies that are still represented by Labor members what the implications of some of those changes would be. For example, if we accepted those targets, planned investment in energy intensive and mineral processing industries&mdash;in gas, aluminium processing, nickel processing, magnesium smelting and iron and steel processing&mdash;in the next five years would be threatened, losing the potential according to some estimates of 90,000 long-term Australian jobs. The impact on demand and prices would mean that coal output by 2010 would be 20 per cent lower than otherwise planned and aluminium smelting would be 25 per cent lower than now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Australia and Queensland would be especially affected, as would the brown coal industry in the Latrobe Valley, the aluminium industry in western Victoria, the coal and aluminium industries in the Hunter Valley and the Illawarra&mdash;and I remind the member who sits opposite of his responsibility to his constituents in the coalmining areas of the Illawarra of New South Wales&mdash;Gladstone and the Bowen Basin in Queensland, the iron triangle in South Australia and the Kwinana and north&hyphen;western area of Western Australia. The broader dislocation in these areas would be immense and, more broadly, fuel and electricity prices would dramatically increase for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention these specific regional facts to bring home to the parliament and to the Australian people that this is no theoretical rhetorical exchange. What is being asked of us, particularly by the European Union, would impose unacceptable costs on the Australian community. The Australian nation produces 1.4 per cent of all world greenhouse gas emissions. We are prepared to play our fair part. We are prepared to carry a reasonable burden, but we are not prepared to sell out the Australian national interest. I hope that on this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issue we can get support from the Australian Labor Party instead of a nitpicking surrender of the Australian national interest, which is so often their approach when there is any disagreement between Australia and the rest of the world. It is always the fault of Australia, and it is always a case of us apologising to the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind those who sit opposite and the Australian public that as well as those impacts&mdash;and I will be having some more to say about this over the weeks and months ahead in the lead-up to the Kyoto summit&mdash;ABARE has estimated that, if we sought by the year 2010 to return to 1990 greenhouse gas levels&mdash;the commitments that were made by Ros Kelly as environment minister at the Rio summit on behalf of the former Labor government&mdash;not only would it have those deleterious effects but also it could involve an increase in petrol prices of up to 70c a litre, a similar increase in diesel prices, an increase in natural gas prices of up to 40c a litre and an increase in average electricity prices of up to 100 per cent over current levels. Apparently that is the sort of outcome that the Labor Premier of New South Wales wants. I will be interested to know whether the leader of the Labor Party in the Australian parliament also wants that outcome.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are in the process of doing&mdash;we would appreciate a united Australian voice on this because it would be in the Australian national interest to have it&mdash;is endeavouring to get the point across that if you go down the European path, for example, you have no hope of having differentiation, no hope at all.

As a result of that, we will see job opportunities opening up in the economy for thousands of other Australians who have been denied those opportunities by the inefficiencies on the waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It says a lot about the opposition that last week they were attacking us for being partisan.

They were caught red&hyphen;handed on the television for all to see engaging in the practice of the nick, where people are paid time and a half, double time and more for not working&mdash;in fact, for going home. It is an interesting reflection on how the Labor Party have changed. They were attacking us for being partisan but, when they were in government, this very issue of the reform of the waterfront as it relates to Cairns was a matter of public debate back in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope you have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> out. As you were calling me partisan, what does that say about Bob Collins? If you go back to 1990, the failed WIRA process was proposing a reduction in the number of employees on the port of Cairns, on the waterfront, to 16. A deal was done with the unions that the number of wharfies required on the port of Cairns was 16. The company, NSS, said, `Hang on, we don't need 16. We need five or six people to do the very job that 16 are proposing to do.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the Labor Party's position back in 1990? Were they attacking the proponents of this as being partisan? Were they attacking the company as being partisan because the

By the end of year 3 they should not be learning to read, they should be reading to learn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been demonstrated beyond serious question by the first national English literacy survey in 16 years is that one-third of Australian school children in year 3 and year 5 cannot read or write to a satisfactory standard. It shows that boys are behind girls and that the great majority of indigenous students fall well below the national standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year, the federal government instituted the first national literacy plan, which all the state and territory ministers agreed to. The response of the state and territory ministers to this survey has been disappointing. What they have sought to do has been to defend the lowest standards embodied in the state tests against the national standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every person in this House needs to know that the national standard was developed by a benchmarking task force, whose membership comprises representatives of the states and territories with the Commonwealth, in consultation with Australia's top literacy experts and that it was applied to the most comprehensive English literacy survey for 16 years by Australia's most expert body, the Australian Council for Educational Research.

On the contrary, schools funding was quarantined by this government in the budget last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the four&hyphen;year funding period passed in the state grants legislation which went through the Senate last year, government schools in this country will be receiving an additional $2.3 billion over and above what

Indeed, over the four&hyphen;year funding period the federal government is spending some $638 million on special literacy programs, which absorb the former disadvantaged schools program without any reduction in funding, which absorb the former English as a second language program without any reduction in funding.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The $517 million AAA package will help farmers take advantage, firstly, of the solid economic foundations that the government is laying for them through lower interest rates and reforms in the labour market and so forth. It will build on wider government rural policy reform aimed at investing resources where they are needed, such as in quarantine and the area of resource management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package has a substantial number of important elements. I just want to touch briefly on some of them. There will be, firstly, the establishment of a single tax&hyphen;linked farm management deposit scheme, which will be run by the financial institutions for the first time; secondly, help for farmers to further develop their business management skills under the $50 million farm business improvement program, or Farmbis; a continuation of demand driven exceptional circumstances assistance for farmers; very substantial assistance in the area of allowing older farmers to transfer ownership of the family farm to a younger generation and enjoy immediate access to the age pension; a farm family restart scheme worth $120 million starting from 1 December this year, which will involve income support, professional advice on the viability of businesses and re&hyphen;establishment grants; and an improved rural communities program of around $40 million offering a range of things from telecentres through to credit care and rural finances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can confirm that the firm, Daiwa Securities Australia Ltd, has been suspended from its role in the Telstra selling syndicate for the rest of the world tranche, in light of investigations of Daiwa by regulatory authorities in Japan.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wants to acknowledge that the investigations of Daiwa by the Japanese regulatory authorities are ongoing, and that no charges of a civil or criminal nature have been brought against Daiwa. However, the government is of the opinion that the paramount issue is public confidence in the integrity and probity of the process&mdash;that is, the Telstra sales process&mdash;and of all those who are engaged in the sale. The suspension of Daiwa at this stage, pending further advice and information, will protect that public confidence in the process as critical stages of the Telstra sale approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned previously, Daiwa had been engaged to assist in the sale of Telstra shares and the rest of the world tranche, which means outside Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe. With the suspension of Daiwa from the selling syndicate, the firms currently working as joint global coordinators on the sale, which are ABN AMRO Rothschild, CS First Boston and J.B.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question.

We actually took that position to the safety net wage case and you actually opposed it. When you go back to the track record of the previous Labor administration, what a contrast that makes to what has actually happened for the low paid since we have been in office. If you look at the recent decision by the commission for the low paid of a $10 a week wage increase, in fact that represented a real increase of 2.6 per cent over the year to the June quarter 1997. That is a very fair and very good position for the low paid.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The MUA is not the low paid. This is supposed to be at the throbbing heart of the labour movement, but these people are on 80 grand plus a year.

These are the rorters' supporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits that the MUA have picked up for themselves over the years are absolutely incredible. I will take just one set of benefits which are available today in Queensland ports, in particular in respect of the clothing which is provided under agreements to people who are working on the waterfront in Queensland. This is a real live today example. I do not mind people getting safety boots and safety material, but under the agreement these people get shorts or trousers, shirts with long or short sleeves, overalls issued clean at work daily, winter jackets, sunglasses, sun blockout and work gloves. That is fair enough but one pair per shift. They even get a laundry allowance of $13.90 per week, but of course the company is required in fact to provide the laundry for your overalls anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to top it off, employees are required to wear hard hats when they are at work, but under the agreement they are still issued with the Akubra broad&hyphen;brimmed hats. They have to wear the hard hat, but they also get the Akubra. So if you ride a bike to work and you do anything when you get to work, you never actually get a chance to put your Akubra on. In fact, under this agreement you could turn up to work in your jocks and socks and they would be required to clothe you for the whole day. These are the rorts which you people are supporting.

I was asked about my contact with Rio Tinto representatives concerning the submissions to be put by the Commonwealth in respect of proceedings recently before Mr Justice Boulton in the Industrial Relations Commission. I said in my answer that I assumed there had been contact. I have checked with my office, and there were discussions between my staff and Rio Tinto on the days in which the proceedings were conducted, principally to advise them of the availability of the press releases issued by me. Matters pertaining to the substance or appropriateness of Rio Tinto and the Commonwealth's respective positions were not canvassed, as I am so advised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also advised, as to the technical putting together of the submission, that the submission by the Commonwealth in the matter before Boulton J was developed between a member of my staff, the Legal Services Division of the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business and counsel representing the Commonwealth, Mr Steven Amendola of Dunhill Madden Butler. They were not subject to any other discussions or coordination with any external party.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8018"> members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which cannot, allegedly, be found;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>

The issue of circuses using animals is very complex and includes: Transportation of animals, where the animals are kept in tiny cages, often travelling in extremes of temperature over long periods; stressful training techniques, often based on fear, deprivation and brutality and often inhumane living conditions, which do not allow any display of instinctual behaviours. We also believe that inappropriate messages are put forward by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks. It is certainly not consistent with the focus on environmental awareness for people, especially children to learn that it is acceptable to exploit wild animals for human entertainment. We therefore humbly ask that the House prohibit the importation of all animals including those listed under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) for use in both international and Australian circuses.

<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a plague in our society. It is a disease that is rampant and silent, the disease of child abuse. Its most insidious form is paedophilia. The organisers of Child Protection Week are to be commended for their efforts to bring the disease to the public's attention. Part of the arsenal in combat is information, and they are giving people information.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In 1994-95, 76,954 cases of child abuse were reported in Australia; 30,615 of finalised cases were substantiated; and in 11,973 cases the abuse was committed by a family member, 9,479 of whom were parents. Tragically, these figures are only the tip of the iceberg. We need to continue to raise the profile of the disease so that people become so enraged they will force us to fight until it is eradicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have all heard the figures that one in four girls are sexually abused as are one in 10 boys. Why are we not all waging a war against this national tragedy? A report from the Children's Commissioner of Queensland into paedophilia was tabled in the Queensland parliament last month. It seems that the overwhelming majority of paedophiles come from mainstream Australia. The report stated that doctors, teachers, lawyers, judges, dentists, scout leaders, public servants, police officers, housewives, child care employees and possibly politicians were allegedly involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wood royal commission in New South Wales also made revelations about its widespread extent. Mrs Franca Arena MLC, an ardent campaigner against paedophilia in New South Wales, has made some very serious claims relating to that commission. As an elected representative she is obligated to make these claims if she truly believes that such a cover-up has taken place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Mr Terry O'Gorman of the Australian Council of Civil Liberties warned that she is out of control. He is also reported to have attacked the report of the Queensland Children's Commissioner, referring to its contents as `simply a joke.' I do not believe that there is anything funny about the report at all. The legal system of which Mr O'Gorman is a part is supposed to protect our rights and liberties. It certainly works well for the paedophiles and child abusers; it is not working for the abused children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Australian Institute of Criminology reports that there is no precise information on the number of paedophiles in Australia. Information on the police reports and convictions for sex offences against children is scattered. We do know that, in 1996, there 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8025"> were 2,264,253 girls and 2,383,650 boys under the age of 18. If the figures that we have all heard are correct, this means that, in 1996, 953,460 girls and 238,365 boys under the age of 18 had suffered some form of sexual abuse. And what about the adults carrying childhood scars? The convictions do not reflect anything like these numbers even though we are told that one paedophile can be responsible for multiple abuses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr O'Gorman's criticisms highlight the fundamental problem inherent in a legal system that does not know how to give children an effective voice and ensure that they are heard in the place designed to deliver justice&mdash;the courtroom. Many of my constituents have told me about their situations and their attempts to negotiate the system to protect their children, which highlight its abject failure. Child abuse convictions are rarely successful because young children are not considered reliable witnesses. Details required for convictions elude them, particularly when they do not immediately report the abuse to someone they trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the abuse has been perpetrated by a parent, the child is often ordered by the Family Court to be handed over to the offender in public car parks. The only other choice for the non-offending parent is to be held in contempt of court. The balance has to change; the focus must shift to our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been championing the cause of a commissioner for children since entering this parliament. The structures supposed to protect children need to be examined and their failures need to be exposed nationally. What we must understand more about is the extent of the disease before we can eradicate it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A commissioner provides the most effective mechanism to do this and has been a recommendation of many major reports in recent years, including those from the Joint Standing Committee on Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Equal Opportunity Commission, the Australian Law Reform Commission and UNICEF. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) should be commended for establishing the National Council for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Prevention of Child Abuse. I hope the council will see the dire need for a children's commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have letters of support for a children's commissioner from the Chief Justice of the Family Court, the President of the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and  Neglect, the National Director of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, the Executive Director of Young Media Australia, the Executive Director of the Abused Child Trust Inc., the President of the South Australian Foster Care Association, the Director of Centacare Sydney, the Director of the National Children's and Youth Law Centre, and the National Coordinator of End Child Prostitution, Pornography and Trafficking. Their organisations work daily with abused children and they know the system is failing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I attended a meeting with victims of sexual abuse. Their stories are unbelievably horrific; they are deeply scarred for life. Dealing with their situations is uncomfortable, and that is entirely the problem. I commend the motion to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The publications of the findings of two state inquiries into the sickening practice of paedophilia have captured the nation's attention. It is fair to say that ordinary Australians watching the reports on television and reading the front pages of the newspapers over the past months have been deeply shocked and disturbed. We are definitely shocked that organised paedophile rings have been operating in this country. We are also deeply disturbed that children in the care and protection of the state have so often been those at most risk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we listen to the stories of these children, we feel a profound sense of injustice. But we also feel something else, and that is anger at the failure of governments to exercise their responsibilities. That is why it is important to remember that paedophilia is one aspect of a wider issue, and that is the way in which our society cares for children whose families cannot care for them. When we as a society fail to provide care for these children&mdash;the most vulnerable Australians&mdash;we make it easier for practices like paedo 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8026"> philia to flourish. That is why we have a national responsibility to provide care for children who, for whatever reason, cannot live with their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the national government working with the states that must give expression to that national responsibility. For those who believe that it is always the responsibility of the family alone to take care of children, irrespective of the circumstances, government action in this area will be long coming. Similarly, for those who believe that the rights of adults always take precedence over the rights of children, government policies which put children first will be long in coming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those of us who believe, as I and the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) do, that there will always be families who need our help and that our first priority is the children in those families, governments will have an agenda for the welfare of Australian children. What this will require is a national approach to fighting poverty, a strong public education system, affordable health care and a jobs policy, particularly for disadvantaged Australians, as well as a national network of child protection services dedicated to preventing abuse, reporting abuse and treating children who are abused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each element of such an agenda is under threat from this government. The costs to children of winding back support for families should not be underestimated. In today's papers there are a number of articles quoting research that showed that the numbers of children in poverty are growing in this country. As the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> says, `trends in state and federal government policies towards user pays education and a harsh means test for Austudy mean poor families are being disadvantaged'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another serious matter that has been well canvassed in this parliament which will have a detrimental effect on children who are subject to child abuse is the split in responsibility between the Commonwealth and the states for legal aid. It is now the case that the states' legal aid system will be responsible for child abuse and the Commonwealth legal aid system will be responsible for Family Court matters. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be the case, as many lawyers in legal aid circles have already pointed out, that children who are subject to abuse will fall through these cracks that the government has created. Not only is there an immediate cost whereby families who are struggling with children find it much harder to make ends meet; there is also the longer term cost whereby people no longer expect governments to act in the specific interests of children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision by the government to weaken the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which has the responsibility for the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, is a step in this direction. Our children deserve to have their voice made stronger, not fainter. It is the very foundation for a national agenda for children.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a very important letter here to all parliamentarians from a family in Wollongong who have lived through the nightmare of having their precious little 8&hyphen;year&hyphen;old daughter sexually abused by her step&hyphen;grandfather. The letter reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mrs Vale,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for letting me tell your fellow parliamentarians about what happened to our family after our eight&hyphen;year&hyphen;old daughter was sexually abused by an elderly relative in September last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before this she was a happy, popular and well settled little girl. She was and is much loved by me, her dad and her brothers and sisters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On September 8 last year 62 year old Leslie Colin Hodson took my 8 year old daughter from her bed and sexually abused her. The next morning she left early to go on a day&hyphen;long excursion with her school.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because Leslie Colin Hodson was still present in our house she was unable to tell us what had happened. She was confused and scared. She was also in considerable pain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That night she looked tired and ill. She asked me to go with her to the bedroom so she could tell me a "scary secret".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I listened in horror as she told me what Leslie Colin Hodson had done to her. I subsequently discovered that she was injured and bleeding. The knowledge that she had been away all day, devastated, sore and frightened, was completely heartbreaking to me and to her father.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout this early stage we were confident the criminal justice system would back us up and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8027"> ensure Leslie Colin Hodson, who entered an early guilty plea, was punished for robbing our daughter of her innocence and her childhood.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We thought Leslie Colin Hodson would be sentenced&mdash;hopefully to jail&mdash;soon after he pleaded guilty. But that did not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Six times he appeared in Kempsey Local Court before Magistrate Jackson finally finished the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This took more than six months. Each time there was an enormous build-up and a huge letdown of stress and anxiety for our family.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our family was in chaos before each court date and on the five occasions&mdash;mainly because his solicitor tendered medical certificates&mdash;the matter was adjourned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As each court date approached our daughter's nightmares increased and we would often find her sobbing as she waited to hear the Court decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Her father and I found it impossible to comprehend that he could delay his punishment by pleading ill health. His health was clearly good enough to assault our daughter just months previously. He has never complained to us of ill health&mdash;in fact he bragged about his long walks and workouts with weights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally the case was resolved. On May 13 this year he was sentenced. But because of his supposed ill health, Leslie Colin Hodson did not have to go to jail for what he did to our daughter. He was merely given a 250 hour community service order for forcing a child to perform an act of indecency and for committing an aggravated act of indecency upon an eight year old girl.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leslie Colin Hodson was put on a five year good behaviour bond for indecent assault.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For what Leslie Colin Hodson did to our daughter, he was ordered to do community work and behave.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was even more staggering to our family because the court had been told he had previous convictions for offending against decency and wilful obscene exposure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Magistrate Jackson said Hodson would have been jailed except for the medical certificate he had which said jail would have been detrimental to his health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But no-one seemed to be concerned about our little girl's health, her physical and her mental health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will never forget the pain of telling our daughter&mdash;at her insistence&mdash;that the man who hurt her so badly was free to walk the streets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last week she wrote her own letter to tell the people in the Parliament. She wrote: Dear Mrs. Vale. I was sexually assaulted by my stepgrandfather on the second time I met him and I don't think it is very fair that he did not even go to jail. The policeman said he had been in trouble twice 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> before for being very rude, and he still didn't go to jail. He hurt me very badly and he was much too strong for me to get away and now I'm sometimes too scared to go to sleep because I know I will have a nightmare about what he did to me and then I'll be too scared to go back to sleep so I just cry. Sometimes pictures of what he did to me just come into my head and I get very scared. So can you please tell me why he couldn't be put in jail. My Daddy said it was because he had a bad heart, but I know they have hospital in jail to look after sick people so why couldn't he be punished properly. If he was in jail I wouldn't be so scared when we go out because sometimes I get scared silly if I see an old man.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THANK YOU FOR HAVING TIME TO READ.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Her mother continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Vale, our daughter has gone from being a happy little girl to one who is very frightened and introverted. Her school work has suffered badly and her relationships with her friends have deteriorated because she feels different to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not have the strength to actively campaign against paedophilia because it is all I can do to hold my family together.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I want to thank you for this opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We in this House must know that paedophilia not only destroys the childhood of its innocent little victims but also shatters the family home and leaves untold emotional turmoil in its wake. The devastation to the victims is compounded when the punishment does not appear to fit this heinous crime, as it leaves an unanswerable and never-ending pain to be endured by the family as a daily reality. We cannot sit here and be indifferent to their silent agony. We must act. Our children must be our first priority.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support and congratulate the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) for her motion promoting child protection. I think the last speech from the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale) demonstrates that we need to do more than mere words however; actions are required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">National Child Protection Week has just been completed. It ran from 7 to 13 September. I would like to congratulate the initiative of the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. Their theme for this year's child protection week&mdash;the eighth one that has occurred&mdash;was `Putting children first'. The organisation chose that theme 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8028"> because of the firm belief that the best interests of children need to be considered by all sections of the adult community and, indeed, the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been indicated by previous speakers, there has been a tendency for Australians, particularly those on the conservative side of politics, I think it is fair to say, to regard children as chattels of the family and having that mind&hyphen;set has caused the philosophy that it is inappropriate to interfere or intervene into what is happening within the walls of the family home. Regrettably, as has been indicated more frequently than not, the abuse happens within the family home. The community as a whole has a responsibility to address that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) said on 27 August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that there is no more important task we have as a nation than to ensure the safety and the protection of our children.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is unquestionably true but, again, it is actions not words that are required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can give an example as to how child abuse affects all localities. The New South Wales commander of the Child Protection Enforcement Agency recently conducted a phone-in called Operation Paradox. The information revealed 1,520 victims of child abuse and 1,448 suspects, with 623 victims younger than 11 years of age. In terms of my own electorate, in the St George and Sutherland region, there were 12 calls, and the information identified 15 suspects and 11 victims. So it is certainly something that touches all of our electorates, and we have a responsibility to do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only has there been reference to reports concerning Queensland and the Wood report in New South Wales but since 1988 there have been at least nine major reports in Victoria identifying significant problems in policy, practice, legislation and funding with respect to child abuse. However, in June 1996, the Victorian Auditor-General issued a report evaluating the effectiveness of the protection of children and found that the services were wanting in the extreme. So we have a situation where, in our three largest 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> states, three reports all reveal the chronic problem, and something needs to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps a way forward is an initiative that has been taken by the New South Wales Department of Education which has set up a national register of teachers who have been involved in child abuse. I note that the Premier of New South Wales, after receiving the report of the Wood royal commission into paedophilia, has called on the federal government to establish a similar general register on a national basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a letter from the Premier of New South Wales to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Premier cautions that the only proper response is federal legislation actually setting up the register and that anything less than federal legislation will be completely inadequate. Those on the other side cannot be too precious about states rights when it comes to doing something about paedophilia; the problem is too chronic. I seek leave to tender a copy of that letter from the Premier of New South Wales to the Prime Minister, which letter was also tabled in the New South Wales parliament last week.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> acknowledges the expansion of SBS television services to regional areas by the present Government;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> notes that there is a significant number of people throughout rural and regional areas wishing to access the service; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> affirms its support for the continuation of the expansion program to areas not yet receiving the service across regional Australia. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8029">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In moving this motion on behalf of the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), I start by saying that culturally rich and diverse broadcasting is the key to successful multicultural communication. The coalition remains strong in its commitment to multicultural broadcasting, which provides for a diversity in language, tradition and culture, and we are committed to retaining the Special Broadcasting Service as a separate entity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of SBS in Australia dates back to 1975 with the development and transmission of a radio service which expanded into television in 1980. Since then SBS has grown to provide an excellent combination of multilingual and multicultural services which entertain, inform and educate all Australians, recognising the various cultural backgrounds of Australian society. In line with the coalition's pre&hyphen;election commitment, the government has spent a further $10.63 million in expanding SBS television throughout regional Australia since being elected to office last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first round of funding, five regions benefited from this expansion commitment by the government. These included the regions of upper Murray, Grafton&hyphen;Kempsey, upper Namoi, Central Tablelands and Rockhampton. It is estimated that an additional 700,000 people are receiving SBS television as a result of the coalition's latest expansion program into these regions. With these regions receiving the service, the coverage of SBS television across Australia has been lifted from 75 per cent to 79 per cent of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As outlined in the coalition's communications policy, the government believes that as a national broadcaster SBS should be available to viewers across the country and the government is committed to ensuring that coverage is lifted to 100 per cent. The government is determined to reach that goal, and it will do so in the context of future budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this in mind I have made representations to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) on behalf of the Junee community in my electorate where residents are anxious to access SBS television, which is already available to nearby Wagga 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Wagga. As part of the government's strategy to expedite the roll&hyphen;out of the SBS television network, we will have particular regard to the demand demographics of the various unserved regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The demand for SBS television across Australia is very high. Where the previous government failed to expand the service into major regional centres, a number of local communities have paid for a self&hyphen;help, low power service. Some of the areas that have taken this action include Griffith, Wagga Wagga, Taree, Young, Orange and Bathurst&mdash;to name just a few. Although it is some time since Griffith obtained SBS, I would like to congratulate Mr Tony Dal Gigante and his committee on their fundraising work. From memory, the cost was in the vicinity of $60,000, but other donations in kind were also received. No doubt this has been the practice in many other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the ongoing cost of providing and maintaining the service is considerable and representations to the Minister for Communications and the Arts are continuing on behalf of the Griffith City Council to obtain some level of financial assistance, as was readily available to other centres that obtained the SBS television service without cost to the viewers. I am hopeful this situation will be addressed by the minister in future budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the large number of people living in regional areas from non-English speaking backgrounds, particularly in areas such as Griffith and on the mid North Coast, which is represented by the member for Lyne, we believe that interest in the SBS service has been substantial. This is one of the main reasons behind the government's commitment to expand SBS television through regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the widespread community support and the government's firm promise to increase community access to SBS television, I encourage the minister to continue his efforts to ensure this promise comes to fruition. The coalition government and the minister have already achieved a great deal during the past 18 months in expanding SBS television services. I have every confidence this expansion 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8030"> program will proceed during the life of the current parliament and into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I take my seat, I also congratulate SBS on their wonderful news service. I believe it is the best news service on television. It is not biased or bigoted in any way. They express the news as it is, without comment. I am sure I speak on behalf of members of this House when I congratulate SBS on the wonderful service they provide.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every now and again a motion appears on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  which catches one's eye. This one in particular brightened up my day. What we have here is a member of the government moving a motion seeking recognition for the government's efforts to expand SBS services in rural and regional Australia. I think if that were the case no motion would be more worthy of bipartisan support than this one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost all of the upper Hunter in my electorate is without SBS coverage. Indeed, in addition to that, it is without Triple J and Classic FM coverage on radio. I have been raising that point with the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) for some time. In December of last year I submitted to the minister a petition from 268 Murrurundi residents&mdash;that is a very large proportion of that town&mdash;and I thank Murrurundi's Fred Lane, who was responsible for seeking and obtaining all of those signatures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I will be delighted to support any motion which seeks to apply pressure on the government to accelerate the expansion of SBS services in regional areas like Muswellbrook, Scone, Merriwa, Denman, Murrurundi and Quirindi in my own electorate. But, unfortunately, that is not what this motion is all about. This motion is about patting the government on the back for something it indeed has not done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion goes on to ask the House to affirm its support for a continuation of the program. That, of course, is something that I am delighted to support. But we need to have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a look at the record of the government on this issue. After taking government in March 1996, it did not do too badly and retained the funding levels of the previous government. But what was the budget allocation when we came to the 1997&hyphen;98 budget? A big fat zero. Of course, it was a big fat zero because this government proposes&mdash;and indeed has already put it in train&mdash;to sell the National Transmission Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The five areas that are either currently undergoing expansion or about to receive expansion, including the Riverina, the upper Murray, Grafton, Kempsey, the upper Namoi, the Central Tablelands and Rockhampton, will be the last to receive SBS coverage under the government owned National Transmission Agency. The fate of those below those on the list&mdash;and there are about 24 of them, including Cootamundra&hyphen;Wagga Wagga, Mackay, Taree&hyphen;Port Macquarie, Shepparton, Bunbury, Griffith&hyphen;Leeton, Mount Gambier, Mildura, the South Coast in New South Wales, Southern Downs, Murray Valley, Central-Western Slopes, Renmark&hyphen;Loxton, Central Agricultural, Northam, Broken Hill, Horsham and so on right down to the Upper Hunter at No. 23&mdash;will rest with a privatised National Transmission Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I am delighted to come in here and support a motion that seeks to expand the services of such a reputable broadcaster as the SBS into rural and regional Australia. All Australians are entitled to be able to access the service and the only thing that will provide that access to the people in areas such as my own electorate is a rural funding commitment to the SBS. I say again that I am happy to come in here and fight for the expansion of SBS into rural and regional Australia, but I am not prepared to come in here and support a motion that seeks to give credit where credit is not due.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point I would like to make is that the National Transmission Agency was planning to move its Sydney transmitter from Gore Hill in Sydney to Artarmon. I am advised that that move alone would have extended SBS services to tens of thousands of people in rural and regional Australia because it would have lifted the height of the transmit 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8031"> ter some 85 metres. Why isn't the move now to be undertaken? The move is not to be undertaken because there is no money left in the budget. The government has slashed the funding for that proposal simply because of its plans to privatise the National Transmission Agency, and it has decided not to extend any further funding to the organisation until after that sale has transpired. So the way this motion seeks to pat the government on the back is out of order, but I am happy to support the expansion of SBS services. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I know that it is a bit of a cliche, but it is true that our children are our future and there can be no more important areas of government policy than those which have implications for the ability of younger Australians to reach their full potential. These are the decisions which affect their opportunity to receive a decent education, their ability to secure work, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their opportunity to make a positive contribution to society and their ability to be happy, to eventually have a family of their own, to provide for that family and to raise their children in a fair society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By providing policy advice and scrutinising legislation which has implications for younger Australians, an Office of Children and Young People within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet would assist in ensuring that the government gets it right for younger Australians. The establishment of the Office of Children and Young People would also send an important message to the community, and that is that the government is committed to improving the policies and programs which enhance the community's ability to protect and provide for younger Australians, to give them a voice and to provide them with an opportunity to work, to play and to make a contribution to society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition that I am putting to the House today is not novel or unique. The New South Wales government already has an Office of Children and Young People and I understand that a number of states have similar bodies. The office is part of the Cabinet Office in New South Wales and is able to consider and contribute to policy proposals from any government department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The office is a central point of contact for peak organisations representative of the views of children and young people, and this enables it to be alert to the issues of concern to younger Australians and to ensure that those issues are taken into account when the government is developing policy&mdash;policies like the government's position on the heroin trial, for example, or policies like the government's new youth allowance, which must represent a larger threat to younger Australians than any of the decisions we have hitherto seen from the Howard government, whether they be cuts to university funding, changes to HECS or indeed cuts to child-care funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot accept that the new youth allowance would have successfully passed through the government party room if it had been subject to scrutiny by an Office of Children and Young People or some similar body. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8032"> a nasty and ill-conceived piece of public policy driven by two things: an obsession with the budget bottom line and the government's populist approach to public policy issues. An Office of Children and Young People would have set alarm bells ringing over the new youth allowance and, hopefully, would not have allowed the allowance to become legislation. Policy initiatives like the new youth allowance serve only to increase youth cynicism of politicians and the political process. They represent the big stick and the `we know what is best for you' approaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A properly resourced Office of Children and Young People will empower young Australians by consulting with them and inviting them to be part of the decision making process. It could encompass a means of allowing younger Australians to express their views on current political issues by, for example, an Internet site on which a correspondent would need to be registered to express his or her view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no more deserving a motion of bipartisan support than the one I have submitted to the House, and I commend it to honourable members. Youth unemployment, youth crime, youth suicide and drug addiction are problems that can no longer be ignored in this country and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has nothing to lose by at least trialling such a proposal.

All of our children deserve the right to be brought up in a safe and secure environment free from the threat of physical, emotional and sexual abuse, and I sincerely believe that our young people should have a say in the sentencing laws in crimes against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that many Australians do have a cynical attitude about politics and politicians. This parliament is but a microcosm of the Australian community: there are good and bad people in this place just as there are good and bad people in the community. Whilst some young people may share the cynicism of their parents, I have found that many of them take a great interest in the governance of our country. They seem more tolerant and able to understand the role of politicians whilst not always agreeing with their actions. Indeed, young people can sometimes be the greatest critics of politics, yet the criticisms are often touched with a sense of reality and truth. They seem to understand the really important issues that face our communities and are not afraid to adopt new and sometimes unpopular methods of resolving them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Experience can often bring greater wisdom, but it can also bring a resistance to change. There are some on the other side of this chamber who have resisted many of the reforms adopted by this government that will prepare Australia for the next century. I ask those opposite to talk to some of the young people in their electorates and see how willing they are to take up the challenges of our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8033"> times and adapt to changed circumstances. I believe they may learn a thing or two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken before about the young people of Salisbury East High School in my Makin electorate who have written to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to express their support for the work for the dole program. These young people see what Labor will not: that work for the dole is a wonderful way of helping the long&hyphen;term unemployed regain their confidence and self&hyphen;esteem whilst providing services to the community. I also welcome the initiative of the Minister for Family Services, the Hon. Judy Moylan, in announcing the establishment of the National Child Abuse Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All governments need to keep the interests of children and young people at the forefront of policy direction. Every decision we make will affect the future of this nation and it is the challenge of each generation to leave it in better shape than we found it. The Howard government is certainly promising to do that in many ways. The establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust through the partial sale of Telstra, opposed once again by Labor, will ensure funding for the rejuvenation and protection of our natural environment well into the next century. Young people fully comprehend the importance of our natural heritage and I am pleased to be part of a government which is taking heed of their concerns and actually doing something to fix the problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as important is the good housekeeping of the country's finances. I strongly believe that we must not spend today and leave the debts for tomorrow; we must not leave our children with the legacy of financial burdens that will burden them for decades. Our role is to set a good example by budgeting to live within our means and expand our economy so that further opportunities and challenges are opened up. This is the aim of this government and of all responsible governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we move into a new century, we will need to consult more with our young people and to ensure that their voices are heard on the matters that count. Unlike some, I am greatly optimistic about the future of Australia and its people and I think we have a fine 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> number of good young Australians who are ready, willing and able to take the challenges and responsibilities of the 21st century. It is up to us, as community leaders, to ensure our young people do have a voice and a say in the decision making processes that affect not only them but ultimately all of us.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wholeheartedly support and congratulate the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) on this motion. I know this debate is being watched by the hardworking member for Chifley (Mr Price) and by some of the students from a primary school in his electorate who are in the gallery, and that is quite appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a framework for Australia to establish an Office of Children and Young People and that is through Australia's ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. There are many on the conservative side of politics who still regard that treaty as the consequences of a New Age globalist plot to corrupt the youth of this country and to override the rights of parents. Nothing could be further from the truth. The preamble to that convention states that the parties are convinced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the family, as the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well&hyphen;being of all its members and particularly children, should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the community.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clause 5 states that the parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents. Clause 18 states that parents or, as the case may be, legal guardians have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of children. But those on the conservative side of politics fail to appreciate that the reality is that there are many families where the loving environment that hopefully we have all had in our younger days is simply not present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a chronic need for a government agency to address the situation which occurs there. For instance, the terms of the treaty require each and every government which is signatory to it to take steps to protect their children and youth from exposure to narcotics, exposure to pornography, and even to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8034"> give protection from child slavery. There was an example in New South Wales last week when two parents were convicted of just that. So there is a chronic and current issue as to the problems confronting children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The treaty also requires the government to address a whole range of government policy areas. One that frequently touches members of this House is the issue of mobile telephone towers being constructed in the vicinity of schools. I doubt there would be a member who had not had a complaint from a school in their electorate. I read with alarm today a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> indicating that British research suggests that even low level radiation from mobile telephone towers may be the source of memory loss. That is something that is undergoing further research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My local community has had some success in convincing Telstra to move a proposed tower away from a school, but unfortunately Vodafone is proposing to build a mobile telephone radio base tower in the vicinity of the Blakehurst Primary School in my electorate. In their correspondence to me, Vodafone admits that there is a scientific controversy about whether the low level radiation emitted from these towers is a source of health problems. It says, however, that it still remains a speculative issue. In my former life as a lawyer, I had cause to act on behalf of a number of workers who had developed mesothelioma from exposure to asbestos. That exposure was 25 or 30 years ago, and I can say that regrettably 20 or 30 years later is too late to rewind the clock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in circumstances where a risk has been identified&mdash;indeed, the government is giving some money to further research&mdash;you do not go anywhere near children with these towers. This is one of the things that a commissioner or an Office of Children and Young People could look at. It is a simple measure to prescribe a no&hyphen;go area around schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just one feature. The member for Hunter has referred to another in what it could do for young people in employment opportunities, education opportunities and just generally the nurturing and developing of the youth of this nation so that they become the citizens that this nation requires.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have spent a lot of time since winning the seat of Capricornia in developing stronger links between the government and youth by involving them in the political arena, basically to get a first&hyphen;hand view of how the parliamentary system really works. In the first months of office I conducted a youth employment program known as the YEP Gathering. Seventy&hyphen;five unemployment youths between the ages of 16 and 19 attended, and together we worked to develop their individuality and assist them to focus on their future by stimulating their minds to develop a sense of self&hyphen;worth and pride, to trigger personal motivation and to project themselves so that they could develop their goals and work towards gaining employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another initiative that is working is to give them the opportunity to pick a subject that interests them, write a view on the topic, discuss it to see how it would affect the community and submit it to the media and see the response from the various letter writers within the circulation area of the local newspaper. This is working well. The youth have the opportunity to come into my electorate office and we sit down and go through it with them. Some of them are working currently in the Central Queensland University studying journalism. So it is a first&hyphen;hand opportunity for them to experience exactly what happens. I commend that as working very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first part of the motion recognises the important role that today's children and younger Australians will play in determining Australia's future prosperity. It is important that we as a nation give our young people the opportunity to have input into their future. We must strive to re&hyphen;establish that tired but not yet worn&hyphen;out cliche `the clever country'. This means we must provide a pathway that encourages young people, no matter what their family background, to excel in school, work and society. We must give young people an opportunity to develop their talents and skills far beyond the school classroom or playground. The Australian Institute of Sport is a great success as far as sport in this country is concerned and, if we can channel this type of set&hyphen;up into the fields of academia, science, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8035"> technology and artistic pursuits, the same successes can be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the motion recognises that the overwhelming majority of young Australians have no voice in the decision making processes which affect them. Let us give them a voice by establishing an office for the status of youth with the prime responsibility of developing policies with youth in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third part of the motion recognises that younger Australians are growing increasingly cynical towards politicians and the political process, and increasingly pessimistic about Australia's future. It is not surprising that young people are cynical about politics and politicians, considering we have had to weather 13 years of Labor government and the biggest cynic of all, Mr Paul Keating. If we could eliminate gutter politics and politicians who bring the House into disrepute, then the media and the public would regard politics and politicians with much more respect. But that respect must first be earned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth part of the motion recognises that such pessimism is likely to affect the attitude of younger Australians towards key aspects of Australian society. Although most young Australians are not really interested in politics, they are likely to treat society with disdain when their employment outlook in the work force is bleak and all that most of them have to look forward to is continual job hunting and unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we can provide the necessary employment to stimulate and teach young Australians a worthwhile career with a certain amount of job security, then we will be providing them with a good chance of becoming upstanding citizens. They will then appreciate the way government and society operates, and we will have very little reason to bring immigrants into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Office of Children and Young People could provide the government with all the necessary direction needed to implement the right policies in the interests of young people. In turn, this will provide young people with the incentive to become involved in developing policy and, as a consequence, this would maintain young people's interest and stimulate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them to accept more responsibility for their own future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this motion is a breath of fresh air for the youth of Australia, and I fully support a bipartisan approach to establishing the Office of Children and Young People. Also, I commend the efforts of the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) in moving this motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to congratulate the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) for putting this motion forward. I specifically commend him on his proposal regarding the Office of Children and Young People within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one thing the young people of Australia require, it is a leader and a government which is more in touch with their needs and their concerns. We all know how out of touch this Howard government has become over the last 18 months. However, one key section of Australian society which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has never quite had a handle on, and one from which he remains hopelessly detached, is this nation's youth. Apart from mouthing the usual platitudes about how young people are the `future of the country', this Prime Minister has shown himself to be bewildered and uncomfortable when dealing with matters affecting our youth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember just prior to the last election campaign when the Prime Minister launched a bus tour with some of the supposedly youthful members of the coalition who were aiming to `connect' with the nation's young people; how well I remember it! I think the member for Wentworth (Mr Andrew Thomson) was probably the youngest member they had on the trip and, in all politeness, he is hardly what you would describe as youthful in the terms of this motion. Seldom have I seen the Prime Minister more uncomfortable than at that particular launch. There he was, in his regulation casual uniform of conservative slacks and open&hyphen;necked shirt, talking about the needs of young Australians with all the depth and understanding of a garbage 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8036"> collector discoursing on the intricacies of nuclear physics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And after 18 months, what do we have? The Prime Minister has not improved his relationship whatsoever with younger Australians. If you want evidence of this, Mr Deputy Speaker and other members in the House, you only have to take a look at the Prime Minister's youth appointees to the Constitutional Convention: six law students, one medical student&mdash;some of them plucked straight from the ranks of young Liberals&mdash;and only one young woman with any solid experience of life outside the cloistered halls of academia. The Prime Minister sees these delegates as being representative of young people and their views on a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prime minister is even more out of touch than I thought. Obviously, we have a Prime Minister who thinks the young people of Australia still snap their fingers to the `happening sounds' of the Dave Clark Five and Cilla Black. We have a Prime Minister who thinks Col Joye and Little Patti are the leading role models for Australian youth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising that the young people of Australia are becoming more and more disenchanted and disconnected with their leaders and the political process. They feel taken for granted. They feel disenfranchised. They are pessimistic about what the future holds for them. They see a government which offers no solutions on youth unemployment, just punishment in the form of work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In electorates such as mine, nothing compounds the notion among young people that they have a government unsympathetic to their needs more than the government's continuing failure to combat youth unemployment. In my electorate youth unemployment is a gut&hyphen;wrenching reality, whether the Prime Minister wants to hear it or not&mdash;and it pushes desperate young people to delinquency and to drugs. These are terrible choices which often lead to destructive ends. Faced with the daunting task of finding a job, any job, government initiatives such as work for the dole are seen by young people in my area as laughable, completely useless tools aimed at winning their parents' votes rather than 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> actually helping them, the young people of this country, to find work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that young people are lumbered with a government which ignores their interests when making its decisions is shown up elsewhere. Take the Howard government's stance on greenhouse gas emissions. If there is one issue in which the needs of young Australians should be paramount it is the environment. Yet the Prime Minister's refusal to do the right thing on greenhouse gases just shows how little the future of young people has figured in his equations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a Prime Minister so out of touch with Australian youth, there has never been a greater need for an Office of Children and Young People within his department to provide him with advice. The young people of this country need to have their hopes and aspirations heard by their leaders. An Office of Children and Young People within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet would go some way to achieving this. If the Prime Minister really wants to live up to his platitudes on young people and the future of this country, is not this office the least they deserve?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As previous speakers have said, when one talks with the youth of this country, one understands and appreciates their concerns at first hand. Less than one hour ago, I had a school group visiting with me. One of the first questions they raised with me was: why is this government persisting in building Badgerys Creek Airport? I had to take a great deal of time in answering that and other questions because they were concerned with the environmental effects; they were concerned that they were not consulted; and they were concerned that, as they are to be the future of this country, they will be bearing the results of that decision. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too join with other speakers in commending the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) for bringing this motion before the House today. In a speech delivered today in Melbourne on her behalf, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8037">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Families weave the fabric of our children's lives. We must ensure therefore that the place of children within families is central.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The broad notion of what is happening in terms of the demographics of our nation and its families, and the children which grow up within them, is an important consideration in this matter before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is possible to describe a series of trends affecting families throughout the industrialised world. There are at least 10 in number which I would like to recount. First, we are aware of the fact that people are marrying less today than they did in the past. In Australia in 1947, 44 out of every 1,000 women had been married compared to just 29 in every 1,000 by 1991. The crude marriage rate fell to 6.2 per cent in 1994, almost as low as it was during the Great Depression and half the rate it was during World War II. The number of people aged 15 and over who were married fell from 65.4 per cent in 1976 to 57.4 per cent in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, those couples who do marry do so at an older age. Going back to 1947 again, the median age of marriage was 25.3 years for grooms and 22.5 years for brides. These ages dropped to 23 and 21 in the early 1970s, but by 1994 the median age had risen markedly to 29 years for grooms and 26.6 years for brides. In 1972, one-third of women had married by the time they turned 20 and eight in 10 reaching 25 had married. By 1991 just one in 20 had married by age 20 and less than half by age 25.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, tragically there has been, as we all know, a dramatic increase in divorce. In Australia in 1950 there were five divorces per thousand married women, a figure that fell during the 1950s to just 2.8 in 1961. It rose following the introduction of the Family Law Act to 18.8 in 1976 before falling to 10.6 a decade later. The rate has gradually crept up again to 12 in 1994, quadruple what it was three decades before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, as a consequence, the number of children involved in divorce has continued to grow since the 1970s. To quote from Kate Funder and Simon Kinsella from the Institute of Family Studies:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parental divorce disrupts the lives of nearly one in five young Australians under the age of 20, a disruption related to long-term social and economic disadvantages.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Fifthly, the rates of remarriage have fallen also over the past 20 years. According to the sociologist Peter McDonald, the Australian remarriage rate has more than halved in two decades, falling for males from 246 per thousand divorced persons in 1971 to just 120 two decades later and, for females, from 215 per thousand to just 101 in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know the sixth trend: families are having fewer children. The well-known population pyramid that we grew up with is rapidly being reversed in most industrialised countries.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="KERR" NAMEID="RH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr Kerr</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HK5">Mr ANDREWS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been reshaped, as the honourable member points out. Seventhly, the proportion of children born out of wedlock has increased from one in 25 in 1947 to more than one in four today. Eighthly, there has been a marked increase in single parent families. Ninthly, families are increasingly having both parents in the paid work force. Tenthly, the population is ageing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these trends are having a marked impact on families in our society. If they were associated with a better way of life and increased wellbeing for our children, then it would be something to be applauded, but the reality is that youth suicide has risen, millions of youth are homeless, reports of child abuse rise each year, alcohol and drug abuse is on the increase and the children growing up in single parent families are the poorest group in our community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance is in respect of the decision by this government to close the Rockdale Medicare office. That decision is a blow for residents and small business in my electorate. The decision has been made despite the fact that in my electorate of Barton we have a major teaching hospital, the St George Hospital. Indeed, we also have a newly opened St George Private Hospital. In answer to a question on notice earlier this year, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) confirmed to me that the number of doctors in the Barton electorate made the district the eighth largest in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have medical practitioners galore in my electorate but, despite that fact and the two significant private hospitals in my electorate, the government has made a decision to close the Rockdale Medicare office. In that same reply to my question on notice, when I asked the minister in light of the number of doctors that we have in my electorate whether he would consider opening a second Medicare office in the Kogarah shopping centre, the minister replied to me that the question of location of Medicare offices was `a matter solely for the Health Insurance Commission'. Indeed, he specifically said that those decisions by the Health Insurance Commission are made `independent of any government interference'. So we have an extraordinary about&hyphen;face, which also says something about the minister's accuracy in the way he responds to questions on notice from members of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Rockdale Medicare office is one of 17 suburban offices which have been closed; 14 of those offices are in Labor held seats. It is no coincidence that the decision has been made by the government at a time when it is losing support rapidly in rural Australia. One perhaps has to look at the consequences of the drift to the One Nation Party together with some other issues, including the removal of tariffs in the sugar industry and the general lack of assistance to the rural community. But, whatever the reason, the government for purely political purposes has closed the city 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Medicare offices; 14 out of the 17 have been closed in Labor held electorates for the purpose of opening agencies in rural electorates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had in this House, one recalls, the drama of the so&hyphen;called whiteboard sports rort affair. If that was a rort, I do not know what this is. Fourteen out of 17 Medicare offices in Labor&hyphen;held seats have been closed for&mdash;purely and simply&mdash;pork&hyphen;barrelling in rural electorates. My electorate is on the losing end of what can only be described as a political rort in circumstances where the minister had previously told me that the decision on the location of Medicare offices was one made entirely by the Health Insurance Commission independently of government interference. What hypocrisy. What blatant political fraud on the part of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it is going to mean for the people in my electorate is that they will have to seek reimbursement by post, and we all know the confusion that occurs in that process. It always results in delay and it is frequently inaccurate, but that is going to be the only option for people in my electorate unless they want to travel to Hurstville or Miranda, which are the nearest Medicare offices. For many elderly people and mothers with young children, that is going to be almost an impossible task. When they arrive at Hurstville or Miranda, they are going to face longer queues as a result of the closure of not only the Rockdale office but also the Sylvania office. The patrons of those centres obviously will have to now focus on Hurstville or Miranda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our small businesses in Rockdale are really up in arms over this issue. They have sponsored a petition which has had a massive response. Small business knows that a Medicare office has tremendous custom not only from the point of view of people coming in for reimbursement not only of medical expenses but also in terms of other services, including family payments and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business knows the tremendous multiplier effect that an agency such as a Medicare office can have. Indeed, it has been estimated that the multiplier effect on the local community is somewhere between two and four times for every dollar that goes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8039"> through such an office. But small business knows that the decision by this government to close the Medicare office at Rockdale is going to affect the business dynamics of the entire region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue which has been dumped particularly on the suburbs of Rockdale, Arncliffe and Bexley in my electorate is this government's decision to reopen the east&hyphen;west runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. It was reckless in the extreme, I might add, for that decision by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to adopt a long-term operating plan to have been made without undertaking an independent safety audit as recommended to the minister by the Airservices Australia report. Recommendation 27 recommended, as a precondition to the plan being adopted, that an independent expert be retained to provide a safety review of the whole plan. The minister has gone ahead and adopted the long&hyphen;term operating plan despite the fact that we have currently, on average, about five safety incidents reported each week at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, as confirmed to me in a reply to a question on notice which I asked the minister earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister himself is on the record of this House as predicting an air disaster in respect of a particular airline company. I am sure it gave the minister no satisfaction when his prediction came true. But I have to say, unfortunately, that it gives me no satisfaction to state before this parliament that if the minister continues to allow vested interests to dictate the mode of operation of Australia's busiest airport, then a serious incident is not only possible&mdash;it is an inevitability. And that is stated for the record. I think the minister has enough knowledge to know that and, partly as a result of that fact, the whole concept of sharing the noise has proven to be a complete and utter fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the safety repercussions of having a runway crossing two major runways and because of the inefficiency that it causes to the operation of the airport, the east&hyphen;west runway can only be operated during the off&hyphen;peak periods of the day, that is, between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. and from 7.30 p.m. until 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 11.30 p.m. My electorate is getting bombarded during those periods. While all the rest of Sydney&mdash;as the relevant percentages that have been worked out show&mdash;has the noise spread at various times, my electorate is copping it during those concentrated periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I read with quite some alarm a report in yesterday's paper that aircraft noise was having a significant effect on the learning ability of children in the vicinity of Heathrow airport. Indeed, the evidence was that their reading skills were at least six months behind that of their general age group. I say that in the context of children in my electorate who are suffering from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. and then, parents are reporting to me, their concentration is suffering because they are being kept awake until 11 p.m. because of planes flying overhead. And, when I say `overhead', they are literally metres overhead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aircraft noise is having a dramatic effect on my electorate. This government is midway through its term of office and it has done nothing worthwhile for my electorate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Geoff and Nonae McFarlane are real Aussie small business battlers. They have run a shop at Albion for in excess of 36 years and they live in my electorate. They sell whitegoods generally and some parts. They are popular, friendly and customers like them. They give personalised service, which has made them well respected. Like many other people in small business, they have had to struggle in recent years to earn a living but they have managed with the ups and downs because they are straight and trusting. Naturally they are in business to do business&mdash;that is, to sell their products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In or about November 1994, in the early afternoon, they had a bad experience when a person caused a terrible scene. Ross Hill came into the shop wanting to know if they had a pump seal. He was told they did not supply 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8040"> the seal. His reaction was extraordinary; he demanded that the seal be taken out of a new pump. This demand was refused. A loud tirade of abuse ensued. He yelled at the top of his voice and used obscene language. He said that they would not supply the part because of his race. He was then asked to leave the shop. He refused. An elderly shop assistant had tried to pacify him. The customer's companions begged him to leave. Before he acceded to their plea he spat in the face of the elderly shop assistant. He hurled further abuse and obscenities at this old gentleman as he was driving away. The shop assistant said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was a distressing and horrible experience for the McFarlanes and for me.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">According to the McFarlanes, `He totally terrorised us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unknown to Mr and Mrs McFarlane, Hill complained to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on 22 November 1994. The complaint was the refusal to supply goods on the grounds that he was an Aboriginal. The first notification of the complaint was when Liz Bond of the commission telephoned Mr McFarlane on 17 September 1996&mdash;21 months later. A letter was sent to the McFarlanes on 20 September 1996. When the McFarlanes spoke to Liz Bond they did not know that Bond would purport to make a record of the conversation; they did not know of their rights. They were not warned that anything they did say would be taken down and might be given to Hill and that it might be used in evidence against them at some later time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 143 of the act provides that if a complaint is accepted the commission `must promptly notify' the respondent in writing of the complaint. The commission was required to likewise promptly notify Hill as to whether the complaint should be accepted. The commission's records reveal that it notified Hill on 14 December 1994 and it notified the McFarlanes on 17 September 1996. That is discrimination&mdash;ignore the mandatory requirement on one side, the small business side, but follow it slavishly on the other side, the side of the unmeritorious complainant. The McFarlanes had to engage a solicitor at their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cost; Hill is funded by the public purse. The McFarlanes's solicitor pointed out the failure by the commission to notify the McFarlanes promptly. The commission ignored this breach by itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hill complaint is a curious one. The first complaint alleges that the McFarlanes wanted to sell him the pump, not a part. He claimed that they were sarcastic and that they raised their voices. He believes that they did this because he was Aboriginal. The complaint could not hold water because it was established beyond any doubt that the McFarlanes did not have the part in stock, nor did they sell the part in the course of business. But Hill made another statement, and this is the most extraordinary statement of all. He claimed that he was treated abruptly as compared to a previous customer. He got angry when Mrs McFarlane asked the salesman to call the police. Hill thought Mrs McFarlane did that because he was Aboriginal. Hill even thought it a good idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quote the rest of the statement because this is Mr Hill, 20 years younger, speaking to the elderly salesman:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I left the store when another salesman offered me out. He said, `Come outside and we will sort this out.' The salesman's manner was provoking outside the store. He even mentioned that he was a Pom and proud of it. Outside the store the salesman was standing very close to me and called me a black c&hyphen;&hyphen;&hyphen;. For this reason I spat on him and also I was embarrassed by the whole incident.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If credibility was strained at the first statement then the commission would surely have baulked at this point. Hill's first complaint did not mention the most serious abuse of all: being called a `black c&hyphen;&hyphen;&hyphen;'. But, undaunted, the commission goes on with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a body desperate for business. After all, in the 20 years since racial discrimination legislation was passed only 20 cases have gone to public hearing and been upheld. No wonder the former minister, Gary Johns, has said that the commission in recent times has become outrageously self&hyphen;promoting and has developed a culture of arrogance. No wonder lawyer Ross Macgregor has said that the figures lead to the conclusion that race discrimination is a very minor worry in Australia and the commission should be abandoned. No 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8041"> wonder Hastie's law is being revisited with keenness. Named after a British socialist it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in any society racism will increase in direct proportion to the number of people who are given well paid and prestigious positions to discover it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But what about the new basis for the commission proceeding against the McFarlanes? The commission letter of 14 May 1997 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Hill's complaint of alleged unfavourable treatment in relation to the way in which goods and service</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">were provided to him by Albion Appliance Centre needs to be addressed by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The Commission has to proceed with Mr Hill's complaint not on the basis that your client refused service but on the basis of the alleged differential treatment which the complainant has claimed was unfavourable on the attribute of race.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Note the use of the word `service'. The act says `services'. Is the commission trying to amend its own act so as to fit Mr Hill's complaint? Section 46(1)(d) of the act states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person who supplies goods or services must not discriminate against another person . . . by treating the other person unfavourably in any way in connection with the supply of goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What is established is that the McFarlanes could not supply the part, so how is there said to be a connection between the supply of goods and the unfavourable treatment? The capacity to supply goods is the key. To take an example where the act would quite neatly fit: you have the goods but I am not supplying you with this part because you are Aboriginal, or the normal price of this part is $10 but to you it is $500 because you are Aboriginal. Those are clear breaches and this is what the act is for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then the commission has the hide to purport to conciliate this claim. Would any reasonable person expect another to sit down and conciliate and negotiate with a person who has spat in the face of an elderly employee? For `conciliate and negotiate' read `pay money to'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the commission has demonstrated a woeful and shameful incapacity in this matter in the several particulars. It failed to properly notify the McFarlanes of the complaint, even though it promptly notified 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Hill of its acceptance, and this is in breach of its own act. It failed to warn the McFarlanes when engaging them in conversation. Large liability could possibly be involved for people in this situation. This could destroy their business. It acted as investigator, advocate and prosecutor and now wants to be conciliator. It is acting as an oppressive instrument of the state, supporting a totally unmeritorious complaint and complainant who admitted spitting in the face of an elderly shop assistant. It misquotes a section of the act by referring to `service' instead of `services' in order to stretch its application to the case in question. It misconceives the application of its own act in order to capture the McFarlanes in its nasty spiral by failing to demonstrate a connection between unfavourable treatment and the supply of goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have nothing but contempt for a person who would deliberately discriminate against another on the count of race. In my opinion, specialised tribunals like this one are anathema to the rule of law. I agree with Mr Macgregor that it should be abolished. I agree with the establishment of the tort of discrimination at common law or by statute. It can then be subsumed in the general law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Michael Warby, in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Past Wrongs Future Rights</EMPHASIS>, eschews specialist tribunals. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specialised action can very easily become an area for zealotry, special interests, narrow perspectives and avoidance of more vigorous scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again I emphasise my call for the establishment of a general tort law of discrimination. I ask the commission to answer the following question regarding this complaint: how do you say the alleged differential or unfavourable treatment by the McFarlanes is connected to the supply of goods when the McFarlanes were incapable of supplying the goods, for they neither stocked or sold the part in question?

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8042"> was true in Rousseau's time is in fact still true today if you look at the current debate on literacy and education. But in this regard, instead of reflecting Rousseau as an expression of the enlightenment movement&mdash;an attempt to bring a new and greater knowledge, understanding and wisdom to the world&mdash;what we see in the current debate is an enchaining of young people, an enchaining of the people of Australia, by the relevant minister, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He does a disservice to the debate about literacy and to the children in our schools by Goebbellising the entire process, by propagandising and by completely misrepresenting what the real situation is. In my opinion, the real situation for literacy in Australia is one that needs and requires attention. It has required attention for a very long period of time because state education systems have followed the fashions that are prevalent within the educational world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It became fashionable more than two decades ago to effectively abandon the phonics approach to teaching reading. It became fashionable to abandon a very straight skills based approach to teaching numeracy. It was thought that rote learning was not appropriate for children under six. In fact, children under six, and those about that age, do extremely well with rote learning. A number of countries still use it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At around the same time, the notion of teaching grammar was virtually abandoned by most of the profession, and in its place was put simply an attempt to use notions of usage. The result of more than two decades of pulling away from teaching the phonics method and experimenting with a vast range of approaches to reading is that we have in fact produced illiterate generations. We have done so in such a way that we now have, in the teaching profession in Australia, people who themselves have been hamstrung in their basic literacy and numeracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The damage done in infants school, in primary school and in secondary school has not been able to be redressed. To redress these problems you have to do one of two things: pour enormous resources into retrain 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing for people at every level or, alternatively, reinstitute a sound methodology at the infants and primary levels. I am happy to see that, in the last couple of years, the New South Wales government has made strong steps in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also happy to see, because of the previous Labor government's initiative in 1994 to undertake to look at the entire literacy issue Australia wide and to initiate and provide funding for a survey in 1994, that a survey was carried out in 1996. But we have seen this current coalition minister bring the results of that survey into this House and use it for purely political ends. As he has sought to pursue other matters, such as work for the dole&mdash;one four&hyphen;word slogan&mdash;he has used this survey for entirely divisive and political ends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national literacy program is too important to have a federal minister destroy it bit by bit because of his concern to propagandise. The literacy of this country and the attempts to have our children read with more fluency, and therefore be able to learn better, are too important a matter to be left to a minister who is intent on pursuing this issue in such a way that he destroys all of the good work that has been done in the past many years by the states to redress the great damage that was done over more than two decades because of the educational fashion of moving away from basic literacy teaching.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extremely important that we face the issues squarely, look at history and redress the problems. Every one of those children who enter an Australian school will not be able to escape, either at school or throughout their lives, the importance of being able to read, and to read well with fluency and to read for understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The damage that was done to generations of children going through school was that they were effectively deprived of the basic tool kit that any school child needs. If we are training mechanics, the essential thing they are first given is a basic tool kit. They cannot do their work without that. Literacy and numeracy are the core tool kits that every child in Australia needs. Because those past generations went through a long period where those skills were not effectively taught, they were entirely 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8043"> hamstrung. Their ability to learn, to read and to write affected their learning throughout the rest of the curriculum. For a country which had a great locational advantage because we had a great educational system, the fashions of the time helped to pull that apart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The states have finally seen&mdash;with impetus provided by a previous minister for education, the Hon. John Dawkins&mdash;that it is important to have goals for schools right across Australia, to set down some benchmarks, to set priorities in learning and, importantly, to redress literacy problems. But the current minister has used this debate in the most divisive way possible. He is concerned with purely a question of benchmarking and monitoring. This reflects the coalition government's approach to all issues: let the states do the real work but hold a hand directly over the top of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only role for the federal government is not in providing funding, unless it is to cut funding to the states to run those programs; its role is purely and simply to set up a benchmark and then monitor that benchmark to see whether it is being met. But, in doing so, the minister has deliberately distorted the results of the national literacy survey. He has then gone a step further and got other surveys to prove the point that he was making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Twenty to 30 per cent of children have severe literacy problems. There has always been a percentage of children&mdash;15 per cent or more&mdash;who have had significant problems. But in past decades it was not so much of a problem as it is now. In our increasingly complex society today, unless your basic educational tool kit is strong then it is enormously difficult for you to work your way through the school system and then through higher education, whether it be TAFE or the universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does no service to any of the students in Australia to allow a minister of this coalition government to rip to pieces the collaborative work that has been done by the states in conjunction with the Commonwealth over a number of years. The basic foundational steps towards better literacy and towards tackling the problems that have been created by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> educational fashion have been put together by the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, Dr Kemp, has sought to deride those attempts by the previous government, and he has done so in the normal political way. But he has also attempted to deride most of the people involved in the process and to bring this debate down to the very bottom level, to the lowest common denominator. One might get some sense of what the minister is about from a profile called `The giving of wisdom' that was recently done by Mark Scott and that appears in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. Mr Scott writes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kemp's final election to political office fulfilled some sort of political destiny.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He then quotes the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have always had a sense that there is a path that I am on and this is it for me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know when I am on it and when I am off it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would suggest to the minister that, where he thinks he is on the path in relation to this literacy debate, he is dramatically and definitively off the path. The damage he is doing to this country, to the children within the educational systems, to the teachers who are attempting to remedy the problems of the past, to the parents, to our educational institutions and foundations and to the full educational wealth of this country is dramatic and continuing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8043"><TITLE>Roads

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on a number of subjects, time permitting: first, some problems with subcontractors on road construction work in the electorate of Richmond and, second, an update on Coolangatta airport. One of the main achievements of the coalition, certainly in New South Wales, has been the enormous amount of money going into the upgrade of the Pacific Highway. There are a number of major projects happening right now on the far north coast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One project that I would like to mention is the Brunswick Heads bypass. Around $21 million has been earmarked for this project 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8044"> and at the moment the bypass is half way through construction. Unfortunately, the chief contractor on the job, Civilcon, which was the successful tenderer about a year and a half ago with the RTA, has gone into voluntary liquidation and has appointed an administrator. The consequences are quite profound on some of the subcontractors that have been supplying Civilcon to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brunswick Heads bypass, as the name suggests, bypasses the town of Brunswick Heads from the Brunswick River down to near the turn&hyphen;off to Mullumbimby. This bypass will add vastly to the economic environment of the region. I believe that the RTA and the New South Wales government need to reconsider the tendering process for road projects, because this is not the first time that this particular subcontractor has been caught. You would think that, if you were working on a government job, it should at least be on the premise that you would be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the situation with Civilcon, one of the subcontractors is Batson Sand &amp; Gravel Pty Ltd, a very reputable company in the Byron shire. It employs over 40 people and is one of the largest employers besides the Byron shire council. Batson Sand &amp; Gravel has been having a very difficult time due to the work required on EISs in the extraction industry and also due to the moratorium that Byron shire has put on any type of DA. Now the potential situation is that the company could be caught with up to a $260,000 non&hyphen;payment by Civilcon, which is obviously being paid by the RTA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been the second time this has happened to Batson Sand &amp; Gravel in less than a year. The first time was down near Grafton when this company was working on the Heber Street flood mitigation works to raise the flood levee. On this project the manager was the RTA, the head contractor was Moreverk Pty Ltd and Lynx Construction was a subcontractor. Batson Sand &amp; Gravel worked for Lynx Construction, which went broke. In that instance the Australian Taxation Office garnisheed the payments to Lynx from Moreverk and no subcontractors working for Lynx were paid. On that project this company, Batson Sand &amp; Gravel, lost $28,000 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> while Moreverk were paid, the ATO were paid and the RTA got its road built. None of the subbies got paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same situation may unfold on the Brunswick Heads bypass. They have a credit arrangement with Civilcon which extends for 45 days. The RTA do not pay Civilcon up to the same period. In this case, for 90 days they have had an outstanding amount of up to $260,000. The sad thing about this is that in some ways the members of the RTA knew of the financial difficulties that this company was involved in when another subcontractor contacted RTA in June concerned about the cash flow and liquidity of this company. However, it continued to trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has to wonder whether there was an appropriate duty of care by certain members of the RTA or whether the whole process of monitoring the contract was deficient. As a result, whilst there is legislation in place in New South Wales which is meant to avoid this situation, the fact is that it is too loose. In many ways the government should be paying Civilcon faster, which is the case in many other road projects, so that they can pay their subbies faster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the legislation now stands, you are meant to sign a statutory declaration to say that you have made your payments to subcontractors. That is okay until the last payment&mdash;in this case where these people have been caught. The whole economy of the region has been put into a bit of a spin. The fines that the government has imposed are $200, which is inconsequential. Certainly the timing difference between the requirement for the lodgment of a statutory declaration by the head contractor stating that all subcontractors have been paid and the 45&hyphen;day credit provision means that 90&hyphen;day work can be undertaken without contravening the Statutory Declarations Act. Section 4.2 of the New South Wales government green paper on the security of payment requires government agencies to actively follow up on claims of non-payment made on their projects. The RTA response to non&hyphen;payment of claims has directly contravened its policy on both the above projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the New South Wales government and the RTA to ensure that this situation is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8045"> resolved&mdash;that subcontractors are paid 100c in the dollar; that the Brunswick Heads bypass, which will save time and fuel, is completed; and that there is a better system in place. This company is now in voluntary receivership. Myrtle Gully was another project in which they experienced difficulty. The RTA was paying in advance because of this, and there is now Lake George.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must also continue to pressure the New South Wales government to continue the momentum which is on a bit of a go slow now with the Brunswick to Chinderah motorway&mdash;a $220 million project, half of which is to be paid by the Commonwealth, just as half of the Brunswick Heads bypass has been paid. It is absolutely essential that this process be sped up. It has been quite some time now since the election. The irony is that the route will probably go back to being very similar to the one that was designed in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of positive elements that could come out of such a route. One is the enormous fuel savings. Every day up to 15,000 vehicles travel up and down that section of the Pacific Highway, which is just north of the Brunswick Heads bypass. There is a four to one ratio between trucks and cars. Therefore, the saving alone would be about 39,000 litres of fuel per day, or 14.2 million litres per year. At 67c per litre, this works out to be a saving of $26,000 per day, or $9.5 million a year, to road users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of discussion on greenhouse gases. This bypass will mean a reduction in carbon dioxide by 93.4 tonnes per day, or 34,000 tonnes per year. It is good for fuel, and it is good for reducing greenhouse gases. It will also save time&mdash;about 15 minutes off the journey to bypass the Burringbar Range. Most importantly, it will save lives because it will be a divided highway. A divided highway reduces the accident rate by up to 85 per cent. It is estimated that the deviation will prevent up to 130 accidents per year. With the average accident cost at $60,000, the Chinderah&hyphen;Billinudgel deviation could save at least $8 million per year. I urge the New South Wales government and all those players to get moving to start to build it. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a quick update on what is happening at Coolangatta airport. Coolangatta airport is the sixth busiest airport in Australia. It is a vital part of the economy for tourism, but likewise there are many residents who live around the airport who are affected by aircraft noise and the traffic operations. A number of things have happened since the coalition has been brought to government. We now have full intersection take&hyphen;offs for jets and we will have more with general aviation. The preferred runway status&mdash;which was detrimental to New South Wales with too many aircraft travelling over New South Wales vis-a-vis Queensland&mdash;has now been abolished. Noise abatement procedures have been put into place to get faster rates of climb for aircraft particularly taking off to the south, which affect up to 25,000 residents around the Tweed basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have completed the noise monitoring review, which is very positive, although further work has to be done to get night time operations out of Coolangatta airport, particularly the mail planes. This is one of the main bugbears for people who live around the airport. Finally, the Airservices review has been running for sixth months. A final meeting of all interested parties will be in October. From this period on hopefully consensus will be reached on the allocation of flight paths, particularly over the southern part of Tweed Heads. Certainly there are principles that must be adhered to. We must get air traffic across the water as quickly as possible away from the bulk of the population. This may mean Airservices re&hyphen;routing significant parts of the air corridor around Coolangatta airport, but this is absolutely critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some individuals who have been very actively involved in the consultation process area include Billy Evans, Sid Cartlidge, John Moriarty, Bill Pinkstone, Jim Boydle, Frank Carvill, Trevor Stephenson, Rupe Granrott and others from Kingscliff and Fingal.

Rio Tinto knows that, without the opportunity to bargain collectively, the trade union movement has nothing at all. Throughout the dispute both Rio Tinto and the Howard government have shown a preparedness to stop at nothing to achieve that goal. During question time today the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) was unashamedly indicating that, with respect to both the current CFMEU and MUA disputes, he and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government are standing firmly behind the companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a contrast to the rhetoric we heard from the minister for workplace relations when he was struggling to get his Workplace Relations Bill through a hostile Senate. Back then it was all consensus and claims of benefits for all, but today it is union bashing at its very best. Union bashing is the ultimate aphrodisiac for members of the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strike at Hunter Valley No. 1 has become a battle for the hearts and minds of the Hunter community. Bolstering the morale of the company is the constant stream of support and advice from the minister for workplace relations and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I think it is common knowledge now that Rio Tinto has a hotline to Minister Reith's desk. But I am pleased to be able to say that the company's tactics to break the minds of the men and their families have hitherto failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of the Hunter's community understands that in those negotiations between companies and individuals the parties to the bargain are not equal and what the company offers to individuals today will be tomorrow's king hit. They understand that what the member for Flinders and the Prime Minister would have us believe is that human nature has now changed and no employer at all would ever seek to exploit employees if given the opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I want to send two very clear messages to those doing battle with Rio Tinto in the Hunter. The first is that the Australian community understands that they do battle not only for themselves but for all Australian workers who rely on the trade union movement to protect them from those who would seek to exploit their limited power as individuals if given the opportunity. The second is that in their battle with Rio Tinto they enjoy my support and they enjoy the support of the federal parliamentary Labor Party and will continue to enjoy that support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving on, there have been no less than seven general practitioners in my electorate who have ceased to bulk&hyphen;bill in recent weeks. Why is that? It is because over two budgets now the Howard government has frozen the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8047"> Medicare rebate at $20.85. The Medicare rebate is the amount that the doctor receives for his or her service if he or she bulk-bills or the amount rebated to the patient if he or she is charged for the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I do not rise to bash the doctors; I believe that, like all Australians, they are entitled to incremental pay increases which reflect the general increase in the cost of living and, of course, reflect the additional costs they incur in running their business and in providing those services. What I do do tonight is rise to attack the Howard government for its obsessive hatred of Medicare. Shy after being bitten at the 1993 election, they went to the people in 1996 with an absolute commitment to leave Medicare alone. But what we are witnessing in the freezing of the Medicare rebate and in other matters, such as the cuts in funding to public hospitals, is an undermining of the Medicare system. They hate its popularity, they hate its success, they hate its universality and they are intent on doing it over through the back door.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what impact is their obsession having on pensioners, the unemployed and low income earners in my electorate and in many others? It means that people in Abermain, Weston and Kurri Kurri, in particular, where there appears to be a very fast cessation of bulk&hyphen;billing services, who do not enjoy access to a Medicare office, now need to find up to $35 for a visit to the doctor. Of course we are talking about much more money in the case of a low income family which may have more than one member needing to see the doctor at any one time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I am calling upon the Howard government to take its hands off Medicare to give it the opportunity to thrive and to take a realistic look at what it is paying in terms of the Medicare rebate. I intend to call a public meeting in my electorate on the matter. It is such a hot issue. I will be extending an invitation to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to attend that meeting, and I hope he gives it some positive consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As quickly as I can, in the time left, I want to give the House an update on the cooked chicken meat issue. I was astounded last week 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to learn that the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) had invited the Hunter chicken growers to share lunch with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). But there was a catch. They were charged $75 to hear the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy tell them why he believes they are expendable and why he believes they should be sacrificed as a trade&hyphen;off with other primary industries that are closer to his heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he did not tell the chicken growers is something that he has been trying to cover up for some time now&mdash;that is, that the delegation that travelled from Australia to Thailand to inspect those plants that would be processing the chicken meat found that not one of those plants met world acceptable hygiene standards, not one of them. They were the plants nominated by the Thai government not selected by our delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also now learn that at least one of the applicant countries has threatened to take the federal government to the Federal Court if denied access to our market on the basis that the current legislation provides that the decision is a decision for the Director of Quarantine and not the government. On that basis, I am calling upon all members of this place, particularly those who have electorates containing chicken growers, to support my private member's bill, which seeks to place the power firmly back in the hands of the minister so that, if by some miracle he now does a backflip under pressure and denies those applications, he is now protected by the legislation and the way in which it empowers him to make such a decision. I call upon all members of this place to get on to their leaders and have my private member's bill brought back on and to give it their support. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8047"><TITLE>Kurll Park</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many groups like that&mdash;the Scouts; the Country Fire Authority in Victoria, which is made up of tens of thousands of volunteers who sometimes have to work in the middle of the night; our churches; our foreign aid focused groups, which try to convince us to donate more money to worthwhile projects overseas and to help alleviate poverty; our senior citizens groups, which work in a supportive manner to provide activities for our elderly Australians to help keep their minds active and keep them physically active as well; many sporting clubs; and there are Rotary and Lions. The list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1971, some 26 years ago, a gentleman by the name of Mr Reg Kurll gave to the community of what was then the City of Berwick, now the City of Casey, 20 acres of absolutely magnificent land in the rolling hills of Harkaway and Narre Warren North. That property faces north to our magnificent Dandenong Ranges and includes some 14 acres of park that Reg Kurll donated to the people of the City of Berwick and another six acres at a lower place designated as a Scout camp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a newspaper article from the Pakenham <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> of 1974&mdash;three years after Mr Kurll and his wife bequeathed this piece of land to the city. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A simple ceremony in the presence of less than a score of people last Wednesday afternoon marked the first step in the development of what will undoubtedly become in future years one of the most beautiful, most frequented parks in the district&mdash;Kurll Park, Narre Warren North.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the article, ex&hyphen;councillor Robinson thanked the council for inviting him and Mrs Robinson to be present on the occasion. He said that they:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . had been neighbours for 40 years. It was always a beautiful spot but it must have looked very different when his father came there in 1856. Much of the countryside had then been covered by huge white gums and blackwoods.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article indicated that this would be a magnificent facility for the community in future years. In a letter to me, Mr Ian Laurenson says about the 14 acres:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Towards the NW corner of Kurll Park, two ancient manna gums . . . dominate the basalt bluffs . . . the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> spreading form overlooks the advancing suburbs on a brilliant day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our vision to the right below on a misty day, the taller of the trees has retained its basal dark grey bark to a greater height than usual. There can be no doubt that this species of eucalypt was intended by Arthur and George Washington Robinson when they recalled that the Kurlls' steep hill to the south and facing their own property, `Hillsley', was originally covered by blackwood . . . and gums. (A significant residual pattern of manna gums may still, of course, be found throughout Harkaway.)</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Ian Laurenson, in a letter to the CEO of the City of Casey, quoted the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>  coverage of the ceremony:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A simple ceremony . . . last Wednesday afternoon marked the first step in the development of what will undoubtedly become in future years one of the most beautiful, most frequented parks in the district&mdash;Kurll Park, Narre Warren North.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assertion now seems heavily ironic in the light of such a continuing neglect of Kurll Park by a succession of councils from 1974 to 1996. The present Council is to be most warmly commended for reversing this neglect and for so decisively setting in motion the future planning so necessary if the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> 's vision of a `most beautiful park' is to be realized.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The problem is that the land today is not a beautiful park. No&hyphen;one knows about the park; almost no&hyphen;one knows about the grant. The land is covered in blackberries and thistles. Its two dams are leaking badly and are filled up with old washing machines, battered drums and rubbish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Friends of Harkaway Reserves is a voluntary community group that began about a year ago. Many thousands of community hours have been spent helping to beautify the area of Harkaway by the President, Ian Chisholm; Secretary, Judy Wallace; Research Officer, Ian Laurenson; and others of the group. The Jessie Traill Reserve on Harkaway and Kings Road was an absolute disgrace. I believe that council workers while spraying some weeds mistakenly killed a raft of trees. Offensive silage was being drained from a house into the area where the Friends of Harkaway Reserves were trying to work. We finally convinced the council to come on board and allow some work to be done. Pioneer Quarries added their help to the effort 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8049"> and the council has supplied some trees and bushes. With the help of the Friends of Harkaway Reserves this is becoming a regrowing, revegetated and beautiful area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of my grievance debate tonight is that Kurll Park has sat there now for 26 years and nobody knows about it. It is a degraded piece of land with the most magnificent outlook. It should be available to the citizens of the City of Casey and to the community in broader places to come and enjoy its ambience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Friends of Harkaway Reserves have spent their time and effort as a voluntary organisation corresponding with the City of Casey about the park, pointing out to them its historical significance and ensuring that they understand that they are the owners of the park. They have also corresponded with the Rotary Club of Berwick, which has been involved in helping to place a cairn and a beautiful bronze plaque on top of the cairn pointing out distances to surrounding areas. The cairn and plaque are now run down and in need of repair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the city's credit, some of the cars and rubbish from what was a nearby council tip have been cleared and the grass has been mown once, which has got rid of some of the vermin. But there is a long way to go. In their plans for the park it looks like it may be four, five or six years before we begin to tackle any of this work. This is the kind of project that should have been available to proceed under the  Natural Heritage Trust Fund Bill . We should have been able to get funding under that proposal in order to bring this park to a standard that the community can use and enjoy in future years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area behind the park is now being redeveloped on a massive scale for housing&mdash;in my really beautiful rolling hills. The City of Casey is the fastest growing municipality in the state of Victoria, and the fourth fastest growing in all of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My time has run out. I could say many more things. I simply ask that the City of Casey give this project the encouragement it needs&mdash;process it, get on with it, and provide some funds to help establish at least the walking paths, to take care of the rubbish and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to talk about the work that the Friends of Harkaway Reserves and others can do to help beautify this absolutely magnificent area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Until today I have refrained from commenting on the area of justice and the portfolio of the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) in any considered and detailed way, but it is impossible now not to look back in anger at what has occurred in the first 18 months of this government's term. The Attorney-General has now become the first Attorney-General ever to lose the confidence of the judiciary. He has not met the benchmark responsibility of an Attorney-General to speak for the role of the judiciary against the political comments of his own partisan frontbench. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I come sad into this grievance debate. During the last government there was a period when Kerr and Lavarch put together the action plan: the Justice Statement. It was a fertile period of some of the most impressive reform in the law since the Murphy&hyphen;Whitlam era. I sold the idea to Michael Lavarch that we needed to throw off the cobwebs of many reform ideas and to develop an action plan. We sold it first to the Prime Minister, then through the ERC. Sackville reported on it and we had a comprehensive action profile going. We have seen those initiatives undermined and the legal aid system that was to be improved and expanded upon brought to its knees and gutted. Initiatives in a range of areas have not been proceeded with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been not only the destruction of programs that were in place and should have been proceeded with but also the humiliation of this Attorney&hyphen;General claiming, as his reform agenda, issues which we printed and produced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice</EMPHASIS> report. For example, the non&hyphen;tax deductibility of legal fees was given as the new reform agenda in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> the other day. It is in the Keating&hyphen;Lavarch&hyphen;Kerr Justice Statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I want really to focus on the destruction that has been wrought in the law enforcement 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8050"> area today. There are two areas where we have seen massive run&hyphen;downs: firstly, in the Australia Federal Police and, secondly, in the National Crime Authority. There has been a sharp decline in funding for the Australian Federal Police. Morale in the Australian Federal Police is at rock bottom; senior officers are in virtual rebellion and Mick Palmer, who I think is one of the most experienced and dedicated of police officers, is struggling with an organisation that is treating him as if he were personally responsible for the funding decline which this government has forced on him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no follow&hyphen;up of the law enforcement board reviews so that there is resistance in the force to the restructuring arrangements. The reports that were expected from the Office of Strategic Crime Assessment, and which were to be made public, have not emerged. Why not? Because, if you found out what was happening in the AFP, you would see there is a run&hyphen;down in resourcing of overseas offices, particularly, for example, for postings like Cyprus. There are transfers of many matters away from investigating officers back to departments&mdash;matters which simply cannot be investigated and proceeded with by the AFP. In one of the key areas upon which this parliament says there should be a focus&mdash;we have had today, for example, discussion on paedophile activities&mdash;there is not a single officer full time in the Australian Federal Police dealing with paedophile matters despite the fact that we passed legislation to deal with child sex as a federal offence if people are guilty of that whilst overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, of course, the almost inevitable cutting back of investigations, which is flowing through to the availability of hard drugs on our streets, and the Australian Federal Police Association has set out exactly the consequences and costs of those cutbacks and what they mean in terms of heroin which is now so readily available, with the price of a deal approximating that of a pack of cigarettes. The Attorney-General says that the AFP has to accept its fair share of these cuts. I do not think the community thinks it is a fair thing that its community safety, the interests 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of innocent children and the interests of those who are subjected to this kind of organised crime are being subjected to these cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I may turn to the National Crime Authority, we have had inaction there. It is nearly two years since Betty King resigned as the third member of the National Crime Authority. She has still not been replaced. I hope the Attorney&hyphen;General will act on my comment and move rapidly to replace her because it is a three&hyphen;person board and the axe is still over its head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have got to ask why the reviews were held of the National Crime Authority. I suspect it is because this government is still too dominated by the views of John Elliott, who has used the processes that were brought against him to come back and suggest that there was a vicious vendetta against him. He suggested a conspiracy, but what kind of conspiracy? A conspiracy which was initiated by an intergovernmental committee of the National Crime Authority in which all governments, state and federal, are represented. A prosecution initiated and maintained not by the Commonwealth but by the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions. It was a circumstance in which an indicted accomplice pleaded guilty and was given a substantial gaol sentence on the basis that Elliott was a principal in that multimillion dollar fraud. In that situation John Elliott spent some of his vast wealth in a determined effort to exclude evidence that was entirely inconsistent with the account that he was seeking to make of his innocence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see this situation as a product of what Bosch identified as a `cowboy culture'. Bond, Quinn, Skase and Elliott are all of the same age in that context&mdash;some got to gaol and some got lucky. It is true that Mr Elliott's acquittal on an extremely narrow technical interpretation of the laws of reception of evidence in his case has meant that a verdict of not guilty was directed. There has not been a trial on the merits, but Mr Elliott now sees this as a vindication of his complete innocence. It is about the same vindication of complete innocence as Mr Skase could regard the Spanish court's finding as a clear definition of his current state of health.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8051">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the Australian public will regard the role in which Mr Elliott is setting himself in the same light as what Joh Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen said of crows and socialists. He said, `If they fly like a crow, squawk like a crow and look like a crow, they are probably a crow.' Use the word `crook' in the case of John Elliott and you are probably right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We actually have a situation where John Elliott's attempt to turn the spin on this&mdash;where he has obviously lied either to the investigators or in materials that he has provided subsequently; where his indicted co&hyphen;conspirator went to gaol naming him; and where the prosecutions were tasked by a number of different authorities&mdash;is now bearing down on the Commonwealth agencies responsible for crime. It is absolutely disgraceful that the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority have been treated in this shameful way. I would conclude by saying that these are crucial agencies if this government is going to be able to address the serious problems that exist in our community. It is not acceptable that we continue to have this funding reduction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today is on behalf of people living on parts of the Monaro, specifically a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> region of about 3,500 square kilometres just south of Cooma, and for the people of Cooma and surrounding areas in general. I speak today for a number of reasons. The Monaro region of my electorate is hard country but good country. The people are tough people but good people. The country and the people together produce some of the best fine wool in Australia. They produce high quality merino breeders that are sold all over Australia. It is acknowledged that if they survive on the Monaro they will thrive elsewhere. Their breeding stock is first class. The same can be said for beef cattle. The Monaro's reputation is very high in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But for the Monaro the last few years have been tougher than most. It has seen drought conditions for that time, compounded by plagues of wingless grasshoppers and very low commodity prices. This would be bad enough, but the impact has been greater as, during the years following the last major drought, which ended in 1982, the community, along with the rest of Australia, endured the Labor induced recession we had to have, extraordinarily high interest rates and then a collapse in the wool market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given all of this, producers have been forced into selling stock at low prices. They were certainly doing this prior to winter, as they were faced with the situation of no feed on the ground and limited financial resources to purchase feed. This was clearly very responsible, but it will place those farmers in a difficult situation when the drought breaks, because they will then have to buy that stock back, more than likely at higher prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this background, it is no wonder that an application was prepared by people of the region for assistance for exceptional circumstances under the provisions of the rural adjustment scheme. After many months of negotiation with officers of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, an application was finalised in May this year. Representatives of this region included in this application, together with Mr Bruce Bashford, a rural financial counsellor in Cooma, met with me at the time of their sending this application to the New South Wales government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8052">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The application was for exceptional circumstances, not drought exceptional circumstances. This was because of the many things that had impacted on the region, not just drought. As I mentioned earlier, a series of events all coming on top of each other has created the hardship many are experiencing. It is a series of events that has seen sheep numbers fall by 40 per cent and cattle numbers by 45 per cent on the properties studied for the application; a series of events that has seen yearly average net income fall from $2,920 in 1993&hyphen;94 to minus $20,378 in 1996&hyphen;97 for those properties studied; a series of events that has seen fodder purchases drop to almost nil over the past four years; and a series of events that has seen dams and bores dry for the first time in people's memories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also comment here that the meteorological circumstances on the Monaro are quite unique. Severe frosts during winter, on top of four years of drought, means that there will be little if any spring growth, even if we get rain. It is going to take good spring rains to give summer growth any chance. But we are also facing the effects of the El Nino phenomenon. Also on the Monaro you often get very strong winds which too often eliminate the value of rain. Unfortunately, a common comment is that we got two inches of rain and then we got three inches of wind. So rainfall figures do not tell the whole story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is clearly not good. The application, as I said, was lodged in May with the New South Wales government. That is how the system works. The state department of agriculture assesses the application and then makes a recommendation to the federal government. Unfortunately for the people of the Monaro, the New South Wales government took from May to August to make the assessment, with a lot of toing and froing between times. I should also say that, even before the application was lodged, the state member for Monaro, my colleague Peter Cochran, had been badgering the state Minister for Agriculture to do something about the problem. He did nothing and then took three months to assess the application after he received it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally the matter was referred from the New South Wales government to the federal government in August. I immediately contacted the minister, John Anderson, and asked that he address the application as a matter of urgency. I also wrote to the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, asking that they get on site and have a look. The minister responded to my request and asked RASAC to deal with the matter quickly. RASAC members toured the application area last Monday. Besides looking on the ground, the committee heard submissions from a number of people, including Patrick Litchfield, a grazier of Cooma; Neil Walters, a grazier and manager of the Cooma saleyards; Ian McGuffick, an accountant of Cooma and Jindabyne; Christine Venning, a vet in Cooma from the Rural Lands Protection Board; and many others. It was obviously a very comprehensive briefing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern the locals have, though, is that the RASAC committee have been asked by the New South Wales government to assess the application as drought exceptional circumstances, not exceptional circumstances as originally requested. We do not fully understand why the New South Wales department has changed this. However, the people of the Monaro can be assured that I will be explaining it all to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many respects, the difficulty in differentiating these circumstances has already been acknowledged by our government in our new rural policy, Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia, which was launched last Sunday week in my electorate by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). In this very progressive and well received policy, drought exceptional circumstance payments have now become just exceptional circumstances. Now that the RASAC committee has visited the area, I will be requesting the minister to act as soon as he receives the necessary information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the start of my contribution to this grievance debate I said that there are a number of reasons for me speaking on behalf of the people of Cooma. The impact I have described has not only affected those farmers 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8053"> but has also flowed on to the town of Cooma. But Cooma has also suffered in another way as a result of what I must say was a very puzzling decision by the New South Wales Labor government. That decision was to close Cooma Gaol&mdash;a decision which will see 60 jobs lost by July 1998 and several million dollars lost from the Cooma economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason the New South Wales government gives for this decision is that proper care and programs are not available for the inmates, who are predominantly sex and drug offenders. Instead, they will move them mainly to Sydney into mainstream gaols where the so-called `correct programs' are available. The reason for my saying this decision was puzzling is that this gaol at Cooma was, in fact, highly successful. It traded profitably and was successful in its rehabilitation program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allow me to read evidence of that. I have a copy of a letter that Professor Freda Briggs, Early Childhood and Family Studies of the University of South Australia, wrote in 1993 to the Commissioner for Corrective Services, after carrying out an assessment of the sex offender program at Cooma gaol. In that letter she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to thank you and your staff for allowing me to conduct . . . research at Cooma Prison.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">She continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we did not hear any obscene or aggressive language and references to the SOAP team&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the sex offender assessment program&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and welfare officer were consistently accompanied by praise and gratitude. In my visits to many prisons in Australia and the UK, I have never before heard inmates say that they were `glad to have been caught' and they `don't want to be released' until they are able to return to society without the risk of re&hyphen;offending.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inmates said that Kevin Wallis and colleagues had given them the opportunity to think about their lives and most were optimistic that, with help, they could conquer their problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have written to the Executive Director of DCS, South Australia . . . informing him of our findings

<PARA STYLE="Para">She continues further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The project should clearly be expanded rather than curtailed. Incarcerated sex offenders have often damaged hundreds of lives and, without a program such as yours, will damage many more.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So there you have it. Make your own judgments as to why the New South Wales government has stopped this program&mdash;this very successful program&mdash;of rehabilitation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997 should have been passed by the House in the last two&hyphen;week session, but it got caught up at the end of Thursday night business. So we are here again today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the shadow minister, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), in his contribution in the debate on the second reading, moved an amendment to the effect that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is of the opinion that TAFE has a vital role to play in providing employment skills and opportunities for lifelong learning</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Deputy Speaker, so say all of us. TAFE does have a vital role to play in providing employment skills and opportunities for lifelong learning; of course it does. TAFE has had a role to play in the vocational education training sector for a very long time&mdash;and it is a very positive role that it does play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From time to time I have had some criticism of TAFE, particularly in years past when it seemed to me that TAFE was attempting to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8055"> be a bit of everything to everyone&mdash;too many courses, too much spread of qualifications attempting to attract too broad a representation from the community to its offerings and without concentrating on any specific task or any specific area where it thought it had very special expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">TAFE has modernised a lot, it has changed a lot. While there are different models that have evolved around the states, I am more familiar with the model in Victoria. I understand, as I travel the country nationally, that most of those in the training business around Australia, and most employers that I have talked to, recognise that the Victorian model is the most advanced, the most progressive, and is probably doing the most effective and the best job both for our young people and for adults.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister goes on in his amendment to the bill to condemn the government for a whole lot of things&mdash;for dumping on TAFE, cutting money and all kinds of other things&mdash;but he is going to pass the bill. I have a few differences of opinion with the member for Werriwa. In his speech during the second reading debate he referred to `cuts to spending to TAFE'. We have said over and over again that we are not cutting vocational education; we are increasing expenditure on vocational education. I will deal with that later in my few words of contribution. He said that the cuts are being introduced under the interesting label of benchmarking efficiencies which are described in a budget measures table as providing an incentive to the states to achieve efficiency gains in their vocational education and training operations by, for example, benchmarking their activities against the most cost-effective states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why wouldn't they improve? Why wouldn't they get better? Some TAFE practices were founded back in the 1970s, some in the 1980s. We are now at the end of the 1990s. It is time for them, like other organisations around the country, to get better, to get more effective and more productive. He then goes on to talk about the Victorian model:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The closure of TAFEs, described by the Kennett government as `amalgamations', the running down of the systems and the merger of 14 TAFE insti 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tutes into eight and possibly five is a further indication of how these do represent cost savings much more than efficiency or effectiveness gains. These decisions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I underline the word `decisions'-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">by the Victorian government have now been rewarded by the Howard government . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is nonsense. The Victorian government has made no decision about collapsing 14 TAFEs into eight or five or any other number. A research paper has been produced for the Victorian Minister for Tertiary Education, Mr Honeywood. That research paper offers quite a number of options for change because we cannot sit still forever. The world is marching on, technology is changing rapidly and communications technology puts us in touch increasingly with the rest of the world day by day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot sit here and wait. We cannot pretend that time does not march on and things do not change. TAFE is going to have to change too. It is a discussion paper. It is up to the Victorians and the minister whether to implement that paper or any parts of it. So the shadow minister got it wrong. We have heard an awful lot about the member for Werriwa over the last couple of weeks. This past weekend <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Weekend Australian </EMPHASIS>ran an article stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new generation of Labor MPs debunking the idea that the party is all washed up. Their hunger for change&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not any more. These days, at least in the Labor Party, they write books and circulate learned papers.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8056">  </PARA>

But why didn't he say them in his speech about the TAFE funding bill? It absolutely astounds me that he can make these vast pronouncements in a 120,000 word book, quoted in an article in our premier national daily newspaper, and then resile from them in the House when dealing with technical and vocational education.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OT4">Mr CHARLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we broke for dinner, I was talking about the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997. I spent some time demolishing, I think quite satisfactorily, the arguments of the member for Werriwa, who led the opposition in the debate on the second and third reading of this particular bill. His contribution was largely to spend time attacking the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and the government for so&hyphen;called cuts to vocational education and training funding from the Commonwealth, which is a giant furphy; it is not true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was about to speak about some of the real benefits to young people, to employers and to Australia generally from some of the very major changes in direction this government has made to vocational education and training. New apprenticeships and traineeships is a good way to go about describing these changes. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8057">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end of designated vocations by all the states except New South Wales indicates a willingness of the states to move forward to allow us to adapt to changing circumstances in work, changing circumstances in competitiveness in the international marketplace and, finally, to design some competitive systems of vocational education and training that give young people a chance at real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reminded of the merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round of employment programs put on by the former Labor government under the Working Nation banner. They really were merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;rounds: they led to no certification and no outcomes. They were simply training for the sake of training&mdash;not for a job. You could take a course on how to drive a forklift when there was not a forklift within 100 miles of where you live&mdash;and you had no intention of shifting location. If that did not work, you took a course on how to operate a computer, or you tried a course on Horticulture 23 or Basket Weaving 47, a terrific course that led to all kinds of unusable outcomes for those poor, disadvantaged people who could not find a job. But Labor said, `We will give you hope. Here is hope. Here is a training course'&mdash;with no outcome, no jobs and no relevance to what employers want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is trying to make vocational training relevant to what industry is looking for so that the people who need the courses and want to access employment will have skills that are up to date and are what employers want. That seems to me pretty basic and important. The member for Werriwa professes in our daily newspapers to be a modern, lateral thinker, but in future direction he is stuck in the past. He wants us to go back and provide Working Nation type solutions for vocational education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New apprenticeships are responsive to and accessible by small and medium enterprises, the job generators. In fact, we had confirmation today that over the last year or two small business has supplied up to 65 per cent of new full&hyphen;time jobs in business, industry and commerce. Small business is a big generator of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to give people a chance to access the skills that they want. There is no sense in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> training young people in the old&hyphen;fashioned, traditional way we have been training them for 30 years. We need to get up to date and modern. Our TAFE institutions need the opportunity to compete with the private sector and, rather than that being discouraging for them, they should look upon it as a challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A local TAFE director, with whom I discussed this issue only last Friday, said that they looked forward to all the challenges coming up on 1 January next year. They have to learn how to deal with new apprenticeships and traineeships: that is, they have to decide whether they will be providing more off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training in some of these new classifications that industry calls for or training for new positions that industry wants filled. In addition to maintaining their operations, they will then schedule their courses and their students for an increasing off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job component. At the same time, they will be contesting these places with new companies&mdash;sometimes the firms that may employ the trainees and sometimes group training companies. Sometimes private training institutions, which believe that they have the skills and the expertise to provide vocational education and training at a standard equal to or better than our TAFE colleges, will want to contest this market. So our TAFE will now compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The director I spoke to said that they look forward to this as a challenge. The decision of who will be the provider of training will make it more relevant to individual workplaces and increase the likelihood of young Australians getting a start in the workplace.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;As I am the last speaker on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R237">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , I would like to take this opportunity, before the House, to thank those who participated in the debate and to make some general comments about the place that this bill has in the government's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8058"> overall program for funding vocational education and training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is strongly committed to the development of an efficient and effective vocational education and training system. This bill is one element of the total program that the government is bringing into place, and that program reflects the commitment that the government made before the last election to give young Australians quality training opportunities that would lead them on to real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is very conscious of the fact that Australia, looking now towards the 21st century, requires a highly competitive industry that will stand on its own two feet and that will be able to compete with the best in the world. It will not do this unless it has access to a pool of skills which it can draw on that are equal to the best skills that can be drawn upon by industry anywhere in the world. The training arrangements that the government is now putting in place, and in particular the new national apprenticeship system, aim to provide young Australians on the one hand and industry on the other with those world&hyphen;class skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before us is part of a package of measures the government has brought forward which increases vocational education and training expenditure to over $1.3 billion compared with expenditure of $1.2 billion in 1995&hyphen;96. The figures show that the government has increased its overall allocation for vocational education and training by $144 million or almost 12 per cent. So the claim we have heard during this debate by members of the Labor Party that there has been a reduction in funding by this government for vocational education and training is not correct. It is based on a misunderstanding of the place that this bill has in the total funding for vocational education and training which the government has made. The bill before us supplements funding for the vocational education and training sector by $17.938 million in 1997 and it will appropriate $890,585,000 for 1998 and 1999. This is part of that total package and only a part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important, from the government's point of view, that we get full value for the investment of taxpayers' money. I believe that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the state colleagues in this area and colleagues in the territories agree with the Commonwealth that there are efficiencies to be gained in the expenditure of this money within the TAFE systems. The Commonwealth has written to the state governments, making the point to them that we believe that there is an opportunity for significant growth in places in TAFE in Australia through the making of these efficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year the state and territory ministers agreed that there was scope within the training budgets of the states and territories to achieve significant efficiency gains. These gains would have reference to the agreements reached by the ministerial council on training priorities. The states and territories have already agreed to give high priority to the funding of off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training for new apprenticeships within their TAFE systems, and the Commonwealth welcomes that commitment by the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian National Training Authority ministerial council will, at its meeting in November 1997, agree to the final allocation of the funds appropriated through previous legislation and continued in this legislation. I have written to all the state and territory ministers saying that the application of the principle that growth be derived from efficiencies can and should reflect the individual circumstances of states and territories. There has been a certain amount of comment in the public debate which does not accurately reflect the Commonwealth's position, which is that the Commonwealth is very prepared to take into account the differences in the relative levels of efficiency within the different states. On the information available to the Commonwealth, I am happy to acknowledge in this debate that we do see Victoria as being the benchmark state in terms of efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interest of the Commonwealth in achieving growth in places through efficiencies would not preclude, for example, states and territories having the flexibility to apply at least some of the immediate gains from efficiencies to short&hyphen;term measures which would enhance the prospects of further efficiency gains in the medium term. It would not be my intention that the Australian National 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8059"> Training Authority would seek to be involved in the decisions of states and territories on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decisions that the Commonwealth government is taking are not merely expressed in terms of this very substantial financial investment, which the appropriations in this bill represent; the government has also embarked on fundamental reforms of industry training in Australia. The main objective of those reforms is to ensure that industry can readily access the kind of training it needs to increase productivity in the workplace and that it can get the training it wants from public and private training providers, customised to the needs of the particular workplace. One of the reasons why employers these days, following the Keating recession, are so unwilling to take on apprentices is that many employers see that the off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training that those apprentices will require during the terms of their apprenticeships will not add a great deal, or indeed add anything, to the productivity of the particular workplace within which the apprentice is employed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers are also concerned that the traditional four&hyphen;year commitment to an apprenticeship exceeds their capacity to be confident about the future of their business. The reforms that the government is making therefore will ensure that, from 1 January next year, under the user&hyphen;choice arrangements being implemented by the states and territories, employers will be able to access off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training from either a private provider or a public TAFE provider and so ensure that that off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training is training which meets the needs of their business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Training providers will have the opportunity to customise that training, in consultation with the employer and the apprentice, to ensure that the apprentice gets a nationally recognised qualification and the employer gets the training that is required to enhance the competitiveness, the productivity and ultimately the profitability of the business which is employing the apprentice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also taking steps outside this particular package&mdash;but I think it is important to see this in context&mdash;to expand resources available to group training com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> panies in Australia. Group training companies have the capacity to give flexibility to the apprenticeship arrangements beyond those which an employer receives if the employer enters into a direct contract with an apprentice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is easy, of course, to fall into the traditional terminology when talking about apprenticeships and to discuss apprenticeships as if they are time based. But under the new arrangements an apprenticeship will be competency based. Therefore, an apprenticeship that previously would have taken, say, four years could even be completed in, say, 2&half; years. The apprentice, having gained the necessary skills and qualifications, could then move into post&hyphen;apprenticeship employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very significant flexibilities coming into the national industry training arrangements as a result of the reforms put into place by this government. The new apprenticeships will be based on training packages, which currently are being developed in consultation with industry. These training packages will include a detailed specification of the competencies and skills required by the industry and the way in which these competencies or skills will be assessed so that the certificate can be awarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great features of the new system is that a training provider recognised in one state will be recognised in all states and, once a training provider is a recognised provider, they will be able to issue nationally recognised qualifications. So an interstate company will have no difficulty in making its training arrangements in an efficient way and will not have to enter into new training arrangements in each of the states in which it employs people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another significant aspect of these reforms is what we call the one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shop. Presently 18 pilots are being undertaken in Australia. There is one operating in the electorate of Bendigo, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid. I know it has your great support and, indeed, your encouragement. I am quite sure that that is seen to be a very valuable addition to the institutions in Bendigo, giving both businesses and young people the opportunity to obtain quality training.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8060">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate a number of statements have been made which have not been correct or are based on misunderstandings. While I do not want to go through those in great detail, I might just mention that the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) used quite inaccurate figures relating to the impact of the common youth allowance. It was suggested that some 162,000 additional places might be required in TAFE as a result of the common youth allowance coming in from 1 July next year. The reality is that the Commonwealth expects, on its own assessment, that only some 1,500 young people will be seeking vocational education and training through TAFE as a result of the changes to the common youth allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comments have been made on the number of apprenticeships and traineeships being taken up at the present time. While there has been some slowing in the last couple of years in apprenticeship commencements, the government would like to note that what this demonstrates is the desperate need for the government's new arrangements. The sooner they come into place the better. The government, since the last election, has gone out of its way to facilitate the expansion of the traineeship system. In 1996-97, 51,348 traineeship commencements were recorded, compared with only 36,152 commencements in the 1995-96 year. That is a very substantial increase in the number of traineeships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To some extent, what is happening here is that employers are seeing the traineeship as perhaps an alternative or a prelude to the first year of an apprenticeship. Employers are preferring, to some extent, the flexibility of the short&hyphen;term traineeship to the longer&hyphen;term commitment that they see implied in an apprenticeship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it quite clear that the government wants to see a proper integration between traineeships and apprenticeships and wants to encourage all industries to look beyond the shorter term traineeship to longer term quality training. Over the next couple of years we are certainly going to see coming into place training arrangements which are neither the existing traineeship nor the traditional apprenticeship but training arrange 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ments which perhaps extend over two years and provide apprenticeship level qualifications. The government is also keen to encourage businesses to use the new industrial relations arrangements, and Australian workplace agreements in particular, to define training arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been a useful and valuable debate. The bill before the House appropriates a very significant sum of money on behalf of the taxpayers for the support of training in TAFE. I am very pleased to have been able to bring this bill into the House for debate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R271">Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  is not of itself a major piece of legislative reform, it is mainly a piece of legislative tidying up. It is the sort of circumstance in which it is easy to get up and score a few points because a lot of the bill is based on drafting and other minor errors in the original bill. But this bill will not be noted for what is in it. Most of the debate, I suspect, around this bill will be about what is not on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not mean by that that people will be straying outside the parameters of the standing orders because this is a bill to amend the Workplace Relations Act. A lot of people will be saying, `Well, when the government took the opportunity to introduce amendments to the Workplace Relations Act, they should have addressed these other shortcomings as well,' and that is principally what I intend to do. In terms of where industrial relations is in Australia today and the significant matters in public discourse about the workplace relations legislation, that is where the emphasis needs to be, should be and must be. They are the issues on which the people who sent us here, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8061"> on whichever side of politics it might be, are concerned to hear the debate conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, speaking on behalf of the opposition, I need first to address the detail of the legislation and I will although not at length. There are a lot of amendments in this bill. Many of them are genuinely technical amendments, correcting minor drafting errors or oversights. I am not, as I said earlier, interested in scoring cheap points about who should have noticed the mistakes were there in the first place. That does not matter. We have got the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though some of the sections that are being changed by these technical amendments are not sections with which the opposition agrees, obviously the legislation should work in the way the parliament intended it to work and not be governed by procedural errors, minor drafting mistakes, et cetera. The opposition will support those amendments that are genuinely technical. Maybe during the consideration in detail stage or at some later stage we will want to say something about the substance of the matters covered by those amendments&mdash;probably not even that because we have had that debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, however, some amendments that are not acceptable to us; some that are not technical in their substance and effect. At this stage I will move the second reading amendment, explain why we are moving that and deal briefly with the amendments with which we will disagree so that the House knows the position that the opposition is taking. I will then move to the more general debate about the Workplace Relations Act and Australian industrial relations. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's attempt to give the Employment Advocate more powers and to undermine the rights of employees under the existing Act, under the guise of so-called `technical amendments'".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That summarises the concerns we have with the minority of amendments which we will be opposing when we get to the consideration in detail stage, which I assume will be tomorrow. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are a series of amendments governing four particular matters which increase the powers of the Employment Advocate. They are not major increases. The amendments do not go to the core of the issues of concern we have with the Employment Advocate, which is that we do not believe the position should exist at all. We would and we will abolish that position in government. But, for so long as it exists, we have profound concern about the way in which it operates and the way in which it is being operated by the incumbent. But not only that, we also have concern over the powers, the functions, the operation and the whole rationale of the concept of the Office of the Employment Advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no way the opposition will vote for amendments to give more powers to the Office of the Employment Advocate in general or to the way it is currently being operated in particular. We are concerned about the implications of that position and about the problems with the accountability of the Employment Advocate that the Senate is struggling to come to grips with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also concerned about the charade that is being perpetrated that the Employment Advocate is, in some way, a protection for employees in that it enables individual employees to enter into negotiations with their employer in some sort of even-handed situation because there is behind them the presence of the Employment Advocate who will ensure that nothing unfair and unreasonable takes place. It is, at its most flattering description, a charade and we will not support any amendments to that effect. We will discuss those amendments in more detail when we get to the consideration in detail stage. We will oppose several of those amendments because of the enhancement of the position of the Employment Advocate which has been and continues to be a cause of serious concern to the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are some other changes in the legislation which are of a substantive nature and which we will oppose. The existing provisions of the act provide that a federal award employee is not prohibited from pursuing a remedy for unlawful termination under any otherwise applicable state award, and this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8062"> prohibition is to be introduced. That is a concern to us and we will be opposing it. I am summarising these changes&mdash;the amendments are more complex and we will deal with them in detail&mdash;but I want the House to know the broad principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are amendments about the existing disamalgamation provisions. We did not like the way in which the disamalgamation provisions were introduced&mdash;that is, the substance of the provisions, not the process by which they were introduced&mdash;and we argued and we lost both here and in the Senate. So we are not trying to revisit that matter. We could, if we were effective in opposing these disamalgamation provisions, render the amendments made by the government when it introduced the act last year inoperable. But that is not our intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We accept the outcome of the previous debate. We accept the decisions of the Senate and of the House. We had to accept the decision of the House very early on; that was not in much doubt. We accept the compromise that emerged from the Senate, and we will cooperate in the correction of the drafting which excluded a number of circumstances which it is clear on the face of the debate and the drafting that the government and the parliament in its majority intended to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The objectionable aspect of those amendments for us is that it will be retrospective, and we will be opposing that small part of it. It is not clear what implications the opposition to that retrospectivity will have. Technically it means that the date of operation of that section will be its proclamation rather than backdating it to the passage of the original legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect there is only one minor application for disamalgamation that will be affected, and the people will be capable of renewing their application under the new provision. At most, they will be delayed. It is not the substantial matter that is a cause of concern to us but the idea of retrospectivity without a major reason for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been prepared in previous bills that have come before the parliament&mdash;in the instance I am thinking of the debate took place in the Main Committee&mdash;to accommo 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> date a government proposal about retrospectivity because there was an important matter that needed to be dealt with and which could not be dealt with in any other way. After exhaustive consideration and a very cooperative approach between the government and the opposition, we were able to agree on a form of retrospectivity that did not abrogate the proper processes but achieved the proper intention of the government. We will not support retrospectivity in this case. While we do not like the form of disamalgamation that was passed by the parliament, we will not stand in the way generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third general area of our concern that I want to highlight relates to the existing provisions which provide that state employment agreements are able to override federal awards provided that the employee is not disadvantaged in comparison to entitlements provided by the relevant federal award. An amendment is proposed which will allow this override to occur merely if the employee is not disadvantaged by reference to any relevant state award. We will also be opposing the amendments to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some other small examples which will emerge in the consideration in detail stage. I do not wish to take any more time of the House on those matters. I simply indicate that nominally we will be raising a large number of amendments, but in terms of the number of issues involved it is quite a small proportion, not a large proportion, of the matters before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is really important&mdash;and what I think will be the focus of all the other speakers in this debate who will not have the obligation to go, as I have, to the detailed consideration of what is in the legislation&mdash;will be the situation in industrial relations in Australia today; the changes that are slowly unfolding as a consequence of the passage of the Workplace Relations Act last year which is coming into force this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the view of the opposition and in my personal view, it is sheer neglect to amend this important piece of legislation and not address its fundamental failings, not address those matters that are causing the social and economic concern in Australia as a conse 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8063"> quence of the changes in the way the industrial relations system in Australia is operating. Sometimes change is caused by the legislative changes themselves; sometimes change is caused in the way that act is interpreted and implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to discuss an issue which was most prominent last week and which was at the forefront of public concern about the operations of the Workplace Relations Act. I am referring to a major change in the way Australians conduct industrial relations: the attitude to arbitration under the Workplace Relations Act and the change in the access which Australian employers and employees have to arbitration to resolve intractable disputes. That is not the only aspect of arbitration that is of importance and needs consideration, but it is the one that has been in the public spotlight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particular clause that was under discussion last week in relation to the so-called Hunter Valley No. 1 dispute&mdash;the coal industry dispute between Rio Tinto and the CFMEU being conducted in the Hunter Valley&mdash;does not really flow from an amendment to the Industrial Relations Act of last year because the clause in question was in the Industrial Relations Act. It was introduced in the first draft by the government in its proposals to amend it and to renominate it as the Workplace Relations Act. It emerged unscathed from the Democrat-Liberal deal&mdash;the Kernot-Reith deal&mdash;which eventually led to the passage of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has changed dramatically in so far as it affects that dispute and the public perception of arbitration is the way in which that section is being interpreted and applied. It goes far beyond the act, although the minister was correct last week when he said that some of the amendments which were introduced by the Workplace Relations Bill and which became part of the Workplace Relations Act did significantly limit the power of the Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrate on many matters. That is a cause of serious concern to us and  is something which we opposed at the time, which we oppose now and which, if we were successful at the next election, we would move to change.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to concentrate on the application of arbitration in intractable disputes. We have a circumstance where we have a choice. We have a choice in Australia, we have a choice in this parliament, we have a choice as a nation. Do we want to go down the route which I observed in the United States earlier this year, where during a visit to that country I spoke to a group of workers who had been on strike for five years? Is that really the circumstance we think is in the national interest? Is that the direction of Australian industrial relations? It never has been. We have had a lot of industrial disputes. Until the election of the Hawke government in 1993, we had far too many. We had very high levels of industrial dispute right through the seventies, the early eighties and before.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can argue about the tactics if you like. Some people did not like some parts of how it was achieved but, broadly, we had a level of industrial peace that Australia had not known. Why do we want to see that shattered? Why do we want to see the end of that approach? What is it? Is it that there is some call by Australian people to say, `Enough of this harmony; let's get back to industrial war, let's get back to the circumstance advocated by the Commonwealth last Friday in the Industrial Relations Commission'?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this strike is to go on for months and people battle it out between employer and employee and we see the closure of an important mine, having an adverse effect on an important region and an important industry, as the Commonwealth Employment Advocate said last week, `So be it.' That is not a view that I share and I do not think it is a view that most Australians share&mdash;that that is the responsible role of a government confronted with a significant industrial dispute with consequences beyond the individuals who are directly affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a mythology that when industrial disputes take place, the only people who are affected by the way it is resolved are those directly involved in the negotiation. It is quite clearly not the case. There are many Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8064"> ians affected by the decision of this government that the dispute in the Hunter Valley should continue. Let us be in no doubt&mdash;the government made a conscious decision last week that the industrial dispute in the Hunter Valley should continue and that the mechanism that was readily available to resolve it should not be taken and, therefore, it continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not only 430 workers at Hunter Valley No. 1 and the management and shareholders of Rio Tinto who are affected. There are hundreds&mdash;thousands&mdash;of Australians, particularly in the Hunter Valley, affected by that dispute and potentially more adversely affected if some of the worst possibilities for extension of that dispute come to pass. That is not something that a responsible government should look at lightly, but their attitude is, `So be it.' That is what they said in the commission in one of the most profound abrogations of national responsibility by an Australian government in industrial relations that I have seen in my lifetime. We have a failure of this legislation to address itself to the gaping hole left in Australian arbitration to resolve disputes of the type we have in the Hunter Valley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take some time to look at some of the other  matters that I think this bill should have looked at. It should have looked at the problem of increasing unfairness in Australian workplaces and the evidence that the gap in incomes in Australia is widening beyond the ambit of this legislation. I say briefly by way of background that the most obvious widening is in the massive increase in executive salaries. Second, there is a gap between employees winning negotiated increases and employees winning award increases only. Any examination of the data shows that that gap is widening and it is leading to more unfairness in our society, and this legislation ignores it. This first opportunity that the government had to recognise the problems being caused and exacerbated by its legislation has been ignored. This was an opportunity to protect the weakest in our industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could sit back and analyse why the publicised conflicts in Australia as a conse 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quence of the Workplace Relations Act that we had last week were those between this government, the people it could mobilise to do its bidding and two of Australian unions, the CFMEU and the MUA. Why was that? The fundamental reason is this: the people who are being adversely affected by this legislation but do not have powerful unions to support them are just losing quietly the benefits that they sought and the conditions to which they have become accustomed or to which they aspired. They are being lost, without their capacity to resist, so it goes unnoticed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people who as a condition of their new employment, because they had been unemployed or they are seeking a job for the first time, are entering into Australian workplace agreements that are fundamentally unfair. Let us get away from this myth that they are individual contracts. They are common contracts at the workplace unilaterally imposed by the employer with no capacity for any independent review of their fairness or adequacy. There is nothing in this bill to protect the weakest. To the extent that there is anything that deals with those matters at all, it makes it worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Workplace Relations Act does and what this amendment fails to address is that, at a time of profound and unavoidable change in Australian workplaces caused by forces that are beyond the control of the nation state in any particular country, the Workplace Relations Act took away the supports that have helped Australian workers cope with that process of change over the whole life of our federation, not because we think that if those supports were still there, we could stop the process of change. We could say, `Let's stop the world; we want to go back to how it used to be.' That is not possible. The world will not wait for us, nor should we wish it to. But even if we thought that was desirable, it is impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ought to be inputting at a time when change is the only thing that is constant. We are constantly under pressure to change and change again. That is leading to stress, insecurity and uncertainty. The worst thing a government can do is to say, `What we are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8065"> going to do is take away the supports which have traditionally helped you cope with that process of change. We are going to take away the Industrial Relations Commission; we are going to undermine the award system; we are going to weaken the capacity of people to act collectively in their workplace.' So, for all those reasons, those are failures in this legislation&mdash;matters it should address but which it fails to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill fails to address the `one size fits all' approach that says, `You can get improved wages and conditions through enterprise bargaining or you can miss out all together. You do have a choice&mdash;you can have enterprise bargaining or nothing; that is the choice you have.' That is a matter that, in the future, Australians will not continue to accept and for which we will be advocating an alternative in the lead-up to the next election and a matter this bill should address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, while it increases the powers of the Employment Advocate, fails to deal with the fundamental flaw in the lack of accountability. In fact, in a couple of places, it tries to use that low standard of accountability which is being applied to the Employment Advocate and extend it to the Industrial Relations Commission to reduce its level of accountability so that it does not have to make its reasons public in some circumstances either. That is a significant step backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, through this legislation, is failing to address the inadequacy of resources for enforcement in the area of occupational health and safety&mdash;inadequacies which have been highlighted quite dramatically recently by Channel 9's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> program. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> is not a program to which I usually turn for my views about the lives and concerns of Australian workers, but it and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program have been very adequately highlighting the problems people are facing in occupational health and safety and enforcement. This bill does not deal with occupational health and safety any more than it deals with the enforcement of awards and agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does not deal with the way in which the Workplace Relations Act has undermined the award system for those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> traditionally on paid rates awards. Australians do not want to have to fight for their wage increases at their workplace. Most Australians, and the opposition, would rather have our police officers, our firefighters and others able to get decent wage increases without having to enter into all the processes of industrial disputes. That is not to say that they should lose their rights to do it but that we should have a mechanism so that they can win a decent increase without having to go through industrial disputes. We do not think it is in the community interest. This bill does not deal with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ironically, this bill is being addressed in the context of a government which claimed in opposition, and which claims from time to time now in government, to be concerned about the impact of the number of strikes in Australia. But it developed plans for industrial war. It spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars on that but ne'er a word about plans for industrial peace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a government that claims to be concerned about wages but offers nothing to many. It claims credit for the Industrial Relations Commission's $10 across-the-board increase, but that was achieved only because the commission rejected the government's application for a limited offer of $8 to some workers and nothing to many others. For those to whom the safety net increases&mdash;as they have traditionally been called&mdash;do not apply, the government makes it harder for them to get increases and, with its attempt to have a `one size fits all approach' makes it harder for transport workers. The rate of increase of wages is clearly declining. There are even some signs in some of the recent data that, in the private sector, wages might actually be falling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill ignores the profound issue of workplace stress. We debated it here recently and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) seemed to think I was creating it because I had actually talked about it. It is a rather melodramatic interpretation to say that there would not have been any workplace stress if I had not raised the subject. I do not accuse the government of creating workplace stress; I accuse it of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8066"> reckless indifference to the growing problem of workplace stress and of exacerbating it by the way in which it is changing the operation of the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does not address the important issue of the unfair distribution of work. The government is doing nothing. But, as a consequence of doing nothing, the problem is being aggravated. All these changes that are being faced in Australian workplaces are changes that we are supposed to say are necessary because it is the process for creating jobs. The scandal is that we are paying the price but we are not getting the benefit. The rate of job creation since the Workplace Relations Act has been less than the rate of job creation before it. We waited for the bounce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the same with the reform of the unfair dismissal laws. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in here last year that they had swept them away. This had been a great impediment to job creation, as was the rigidity of the labour market. So we had this major piece of industrial relations reform, which we all must appreciate because, using the rhetoric of the minister and the Prime Minister, this would sweep away the impediment to job creation. What do we have? We have the minister for employment standing in the field looking skyward hoping it will rain jobs in the not too distant future&mdash;waiting for the jobs to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people are suffering a very profound El Nino in the job market. We are having an extended drought. As inadequate as the government's rebadging of the primary industry support package was last week, it is better than anything they have done about creating jobs for Australians. All the signs are that the industrial relations pain Australian workers have suffered has been for nothing in job creation. It has all been about loss, none of it has been about benefit. Therefore, while the opposition does not oppose this bill, I reiterate the second reading amendment I moved earlier.</PARA>

I thank the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) for saying that, obviously, the act should work in a manner intended by the government and the parliament when the act was brought in and passed by this parliament, and that the opposition would not therefore be basically opposing the amendments. I note, however, that the member for Canberra has reserved his right, during the consideration in detail stage, to oppose a number of the specific amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are really three groups of amendments to the act. The first group is not contentious in any manner that the government is aware of. That is to say that both the ACCI and the ACTU, through the Committee on Industrial Legislation&mdash;a subcommittee of the National Labour Consultative Council&mdash;essentially signed off on group one amendments, which is a raft of fairly minor amendments. The shadow minister did, however, say that the opposition does intend to oppose some of the amendments relating to disamalgamations&mdash;there are several minor amendments in the group one amendments that affect the disamalgamation procedures for unions which wish to dissolve their relationship under the amalgamation provisions of the former government. Perhaps the ACTU as the working party of the ALP opposition did not get it quite right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a group of recommendations which the ACTU said they did not like very much and would `suggest' to their working party, the opposition, that they oppose. They included such things as making it clear that the 14&hyphen;day period provided to employees to consider a certified agreement is not affected by new staff commencing work within the period. Another one is to expand the definition of an `AWA official' to include all staff of the Office of the Employment Advocate so that it is not just the Employment Advocate himself who has to go out into the field&mdash;a totally sensible provision. My understanding is that the opposition and the ACTU oppose that amendment because they are opposed to AWAs. How silly. The parliament said, `We want Australian workplace agreements.' It is clear. There are provisions for it in the act. It will enable the Office of the Employment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8067"> Advocate to oversee and supervise Australian workplace agreements, amongst other things. To now oppose an amendment that will make the provisions of the act work more clearly and better is just a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another one of those group two amendments is the clarification of the rights of entry and the power of authorised officers of the Office of the Employment Advocate. The last one is to clarify reference to a `relevant award' in section 152 to make it clear that relevant awards are relevant `state' awards&mdash;simply a language oversight in the original bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The group three amendments are largely opposed because, except for two issues, they deal with AWAs. The first of those issues is an amendment that clarifies the application of state laws on termination to employers covered by federal awards. My understanding is that the opposition is opposed in some manner to that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most significant amendment that is dealt with in this bill is an amendment to ensure that an agreement may not be approved when it includes a preference provision inconsistent with the Workplace Relations Act freedom of association provisions and to provide for the removal of void preference clauses in awards and agreements. That is a very important amendment because we have the absolutely ludicrous situation where the AIRC has evidently made the odd determination here and there where parties to an agreement&mdash;the employer and union representative of the employees&mdash;have, through industrial muscle or for whatever reason, agreed to a certified agreement or to change an award and have included preference clauses for union members in it. That is clearly not the intention of the Workplace Relations Act. Freedom of association provisions in the act made it clear that we were done with the days of preference, we were done with the days of monopoly and we were going to allow a contestable market as industry and education have contestable markets and indeed as we in this political arena in the parliament have a contestable market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am disappointed that the opposition is so short&hyphen;sighted that they cannot see that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliament clearly intended that the freedom of association provisions preclude preference clauses. Notwithstanding that, they are going to find a back door entry for their mates in the ACTU or specific unions to work those preference clauses back into awards or back into certified agreements. It is very disappointing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition spokesman on industrial relations matters has had a few things to say recently about the ALP's, the federal opposition's, new industrial relations policy platform. It is appropriate that I address some of those issues, as the member for Canberra certainly made more than a passing reference to those issues in the contribution he just completed. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 15 August, Katharine Murphy confirms a few things the shadow minister had to say about the new policy platform of the Australian Labor Party on industrial relations:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the centre of Labor's renewed industrial relations platform will be a revitalised Federal award system and a significantly strengthened Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`Yes, let us go back and restrengthen the poor, decimated commission.' The member for Canberra confirmed that tonight in his contribution, and he went on to talk about the desperate need for arbitration in order to provide freedom of choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had some difficulty in following the logic of his argument.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entire intent and objects of the workplace relations legislation are to try to allow employees and employers, to the largest extent possible, to make agreements that suit themselves, arrangements that suit them and that are fair. Yes, we have left umpires in place. We have left safety nets, boundaries and constraints in place. That is one of the reasons the bill is as long as it is: to make sure that the guarantee that we gave the Australian people in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election was actually kept not only in the intent of the legislation but also in the working bill itself so that the parties to all of this conformed to what parliament had in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the parliament has in mind is that, to the largest extent possible, those who really have the responsibility for making decisions 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8068"> about wages and conditions of employment&mdash;that being employers and employees&mdash;deal with each other, make their decisions and get on with improving productivity in their workplace, get on with making the products they make, providing the services they provide and, indeed, operating the machinery of government if that be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the ALP wants to go back. This is the policy of the future taken back in time. How ridiculous! If the member for Canberra thinks, by going back to recreate the centralised system, that he is going to improve productivity, that he will protect the wages of Australian working women and men and that he will create jobs for the Australian working population and those that want to work, I have news for him: he is absolutely, completely and utterly wrong. He wants to go back to the forties and fifties, reregulate the system and give the commission powers to arbitrate whenever a union or an employer says that they do not agree with the other party. How on earth are we ever going to convince people to learn to work together in the workplace?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last three months I have been to see many of the companies in my electorate and, indeed, quite a few outside it as well. May I tell you that in almost every case, particularly throughout the manufacturing industry, I found companies now focused on export activity&mdash;not just focused on their domestic marketplace and not just on production for Australians and Australian consumption but also focused on export. Ten years ago that would not have been true. Of the 25 or 30 companies that I visited in the last three months, may I tell you that not one of them exported anything 10 years ago, and today they are exporting up to&mdash;and in one case as much as&mdash;50 per cent of their total turnover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do you do that? You do that only if you are focused on quality, on service and on what the clients want and if you deliver on time. If in that process of getting the right product for the marketplace at the right quality delivered on time and with attention to detail you find that people in other countries would like your product too, and if you do some marketing work and figure out how 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to get it to them competitively, you have got another edge. And what it says to me is that our industry is starting to get its act together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that in 1984 something like 14 per cent of our manufacturing turnover was exported, and I understand that in 1996, 12 years later, something like 33 per cent of our manufacturing output was exported. That says to me that we are starting to get our act together. It says to me that increasingly managements are becoming more modern and more focused on what happens out there on the factory floor and that they are working with their employees to achieve overall total results that are of benefit to the company, to the employees and, indeed, ultimately to the nation. But the mob on the other side of the chamber wants to go back to the future. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under Labor's blueprint, the primacy given to enterprise bargaining under both the Keating and Howard governments would be abandoned; the Office of Employment Advocate abolished; and the "excessive" restrictions on union rights to enter workplaces scrapped.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let us think about that. The primacy given to enterprise bargaining would be abandoned, so the ALP says, `We shouldn't let employers and employees make free choices.' The ALP, the ACTU and the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;is that the new industrial relations club?&mdash;all know better than millions of individual Australians what those individuals want for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How hypocritical to say to people, `Look, you do not have the basic intelligence to decide for yourself what is a good deal for you.' So what do we have? We have the New South Wales state Labor government arguing in front of the AIRC that the bargaining period in the Hunter Valley ought to be terminated. Why? So that the commission will be allowed, and indeed forced, to arbitrate, because the employees and employer are unable to be grown&hyphen;up, mature individuals and come to some resolution of their disagreement themselves. We have to have an external body decide what is good for them and how they ought to treat each other and work with each other in the workplace. Back to the future under Labor.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8069">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Abandon the Office of the Employment Advocate; abolish it. That makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? The AWA is a modern mechanism for Australia to allow individuals and their employers to reach agreement on an individual contracting basis that is overseen by an independent body, the Employment Advocate, to make sure that those agreements are fair. That is what everybody asked for. I can tell you that Paul Keating in 1993, after he won the unwinnable, unlosable election&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OT4">Mr CHARLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was the unwinnable, unlosable election. He went to the Institute of Company Directors and he talked about doing exactly what AWAs are all about. He said that the non&hyphen;unionised work force ought to have the right of negotiation with their bosses about pay and conditions, and they should not have external bodies' views on those matters imposed on them, that is, unions or employer bodies or the AIRC. So that is what we did. But some people said, `We want to make sure that those deals are fair, that employees are not "being exploited".' So the Office of the Employment Advocate was created; and now the ALP wants to bury it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program that Australia ought to be more interested in the low paid. That is exactly what this government has done. The case before the AIRC was for a safety net wage rise for those who had been unable to negotiate enterprise agreements or workplace agreements&mdash;in other words, negotiate for themselves a fair increase in this very low inflation environment. That case was to ensure that they be given a fair increase in order to assist them with their living expenses. The government argued, rightly, that the $21 a week that the ACTU wanted was excessive. The Reserve Bank said it was excessive. Everybody knew it was excessive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The higher you make the safety net, the more we will have unemployed. The safety net is certainly a trade&hyphen;off. It always is, isn't it? You can make choices about life, and one of the choices you make is what you will have. If we make the safety net excessively high, fewer people will be employed. That is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a fact. If you make it excessively low, perhaps we will have working poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard people on the ALP side talk about industrial relations in the United States. Indeed, the shadow minister tonight said there was some group in the United States that had been on strike for five years. Perhaps they were airline pilots. I recall Bob Hawke and the airline pilots. Boy, that wasn't much of a dispute, was it? That was really some way that a Labor government solved that dispute: not through the AIRC and not through arbitration but through its determination to succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister talked about unfairness in the Australian workplace in terms of gaps in earnings and seemed to imply that government can somehow affect that gap, that government can legislate&mdash;how? To tell the employers that they cannot pay employees more, or to tell employers that they must pay the lowest paid as much as they pay the highest paid, or somewhere very close to it, so that by legislation we narrow the gap? Is that what the shadow minister is looking for? If it is, when he talks about jobs and wanting employment, where does he think those jobs and that employment will come from?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does he think, in a dynamic economy faced with international pressures and competitive factors, that Australian companies will compete against all that competition out there if they have arbitral bodies and governments setting the wages for their companies and their business? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise, in speaking to this bill, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997, to also give support to the second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister for industrial relations, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan). I consider that this bill is a demonstration of the Howard government's failure to come to grips with the changing realities of the Australian labour force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that note, I want to refer briefly in passing to the importance of the safety net issues raised by the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). When we talk about the safety net, I think the Australian community understands that there are a substantial number of workers 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8070"> out there who actually need the assistance of an independent organisation, namely, the Industrial Relations Commission, to try to assist them in establishing decent and reasonable rates of pay. I might also say that the Australian community's record on job creation in the last decade&mdash;a system that is not as deregulated as the American system&mdash;stands us in good stead when one does an objective comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is about time that some people understood the actual safety net increases and current rates of pay that those people who depend on the award system actually receive. I must say that I would not want to bring up a family of a couple of children, with all the associated costs of education and health, on rates of pay like the following rates of pay. I know they are an embarrassment to the member for La Trobe, who speaks a lot about these issues but is not really interested in the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for that very reason I want to place the following facts on the table this evening. I think it is a bit tough that the current government opposes minimum wage increases for the particular types of workers who are dependent on the safety net. Take for example a female clothing worker in a garment factory. What is her current base rate? I will tell you what it is. It is not even $10 per hour. It is a gross rate of $359.40 for a 38&hyphen;hour week. I would like to see the member for La Trobe try to bring up a family on a gross rate of $359.40 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then go to hospitality workers&mdash;and I must say that in the past I have negotiated on behalf of hospitality workers. What is their gross rate for a 38&hyphen;hour week? Again, it is $359.40. These very workers are an example of the low paid worker, whose capacity to achieve reasonable increases on a reasonable base rate of pay&mdash;after proper argument and determination on merit, with the assistance of the safety net&mdash;the member for La Trobe and the Minister for Industrial Relations want to undermine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then go to a child&hyphen;care worker&mdash;and I know that everyone wants child care. But the problem is that some people out there in the Australian community believe that child-care 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> workers ought to operate on the basis of charity. This is what a child&hyphen;care worker currently receives: for a 38&hyphen;hour week, a gross wage of $366.60. Finally, I refer to a process worker in a manufacturing plant who, for a 38&hyphen;hour week, receives a gross wage of, again, $359.40.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I place those facts on the table because I think it is about time that some people on the other side of the House understood that no-one in this chamber is opposed to enterprise bargaining. However, the real issue is ensuring that there is an adequate system in place to protect those who cannot achieve reasonable improvements in their wages and conditions of employment through enterprise bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The types of workers we are talking about, I might say, very much include women. Significant numbers of women are clothing workers, hospitality workers, child-care workers, and process workers in a variety of manufacturing establishments around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that note, I say that I believe this bill seeks, on an ad hoc basis, to give more powers to the ill-conceived Office of the Employment Advocate. We all know that the Office of the Employment Advocate is shrouded in secrecy, yet the intent of this bill is to give it more power and, in doing so, to undermine the rights of employees under the existing act, under the so-called guise of technical amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position of Employment Advocate was created by this government; it was created as a completely inadequate substitute for the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;that independent organisation that has so rightly served the Australian community through thick and thin over many, many years. I only hope that, one way or another, there is a role for the Industrial Relations Commission in seeking to solve the problems currently confronting the Australian community in the Hunter coalmining dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter is that from time to time we need an independent organisation to actually intervene in the public interest and sort out disputes where there is a lack of capacity by the parties themselves. I know, as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8071"> do you, Mr Deputy Speaker, from your previous experience, that it is not always possible for whatever reason for the parties themselves to adequately sort out their differences. The Hunter dispute may end up being such a dispute, and we must have the capacity in the Industrial Relations Act to ensure that the commission can involve itself to act in the public interest and actually broker an outcome between the parties which will serve both the parties themselves and, perhaps more importantly, the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason, I suggest that the position of the Employment Advocate was part of the Howard government's Workplace Relations Act passed by the Senate&mdash;not because of the support of the Australian Labor Party, but because of the support of the Australian Democrats&mdash;last year and eventually passed by this chamber on 21 November of last year, despite our strong opposition and concern about the intent of the bill. One of the main effects of the Workplace Relations Act was to reduce substantially the role of the Industrial Relations Commission and to strip back the role of awards in protecting conditions of employment, especially those of workers such as female clothing workers, hospitality workers, child-care workers, and process workers in manufacturing establishments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the bill did not go as far as the coalition government wanted it to in 1993 in their famous Fightback package&mdash;a package which the people of Australia rightly rejected at that time. But I do suggest the bill goes far enough to ensure that a lot of workers will definitely be worse off as a result of its effect. For example, it specifically ensures that, by losing some of their award conditions from June 1998 by being forced onto individual contracts and by losing protections against unfair dismissal, a lot of workers will be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government watered down the Industrial Relations Commission in order to weaken the historic role this institution has played in promoting equity of earnings and employment conditions in the Australian workplace&mdash;equity between women and men, between younger and older workers, between well organised and less well organised groups 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of workers. The Howard government decided that it wanted to dispense with all this and, instead, take us down the path of labour market deregulation&mdash;an approach very much supported, for example, by the previous speaker, the member for La Trobe and, I might say, the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) with respect to changes on the industrial relations front in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that the token office it has now established to provide some so-called protection for employees is completely ineffectual and a farce. The Labor Party does not support giving more powers to an inherently ineffectual office bearer when what is needed is a real regulatory body; nor are we inclined to given that the Employment Advocate is not even exercising his current powers properly. He is not acting accountably to the national parliament, as the recent Senate estimates process proved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also remind the House that, in his first headland speech, the Prime Minister, prior to the last election, talked a lot about rebuilding trust in government&mdash;his words, not mine. He said that he, himself, would clean up government and clean up parliament. We have all seen how he has applied this statement to ministerial standards in the operation of the government in its first 18 months. Yet the main office bearer under his prized Workplace Relations Act has been treating the national parliament with absolute contempt. This bill would further remove the Employment Advocate from proper parliamentary scrutiny and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some very disturbing trends now occurring in the Australian labour market under the more deregulated regime of the government. They demonstrate the need for an Industrial Relations Commission with real powers. Casual employment, for example, has now risen to more than one quarter of total employment in Australia, giving us almost the highest rate of casual employment in the OECD&mdash;second only to Spain. Under the new regime of labour market deregulation, casual employment is becoming an officially sanctioned alternative to awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is that it does not come with many of the benefits provided by awards. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8072"> industrial relations conditions of many part-time workers, who now overlap substantially with the casual work force, have deteriorated. Jobs generally have become increasingly less secure&mdash;the major problem confronting the Australian community at the moment. It is not just a question of jobs growth but also a sense of security in people's lives, be those people with a job or without a job. There is an increasing divide, I suggest to the House, between the conditions of core and peripheral jobs or the primary and secondary labour force, the type of labour force that is very much encouraged and sought by the government of the day. There has also been a trend to more self-employed people and independent contractors. Clearly, the world of work has changed dramatically in Australia in the last couple of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another negative feature of labour market deregulation is increased inequity in working hours, an issue that I have raised on a number of occasions over the last 18 months. Every week almost half of all full-time employees in Australia are working overtime and more than a third of this work, unfortunately, is unpaid. Too many employers are now increasing the amount of unpaid overtime from their existing workers rather than putting on additional workers and thereby creating the so necessary important jobs that we need in the community at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's Workplace Relations Act is making this problem worse by removing all social considerations from the allocation and regulation of work. In that context I refer to the first independent study of the non-union individual contracts agreed to since the act came into operation by the University of Sydney. That independent study indicates that employees are being made to work longer hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent findings of the Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey, released and widely publicised a couple of weeks ago, dramatically confirm that work is becoming more intense, Australian workers are becoming more stressed, and it is getting harder to balance work and family life. That is the end result of some of these changes. Workers are more stressed, Australian workers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are not receiving their proper entitlements and it is becoming exceptionally difficult to balance work and family life. I would have thought they were concerns to the Australian community at large and I would have thought that the bill before the House this evening would have been about trying to overcome some of the outcomes of that recent survey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alternatively, unlike the government, the Labor Party is putting forward policies, referred to previously by the shadow minister for industrial relations, which seek to reverse these undesirable trends. And undesirable trends they are. The shift in policy to a singular emphasis on labour market deregulation since the Howard government was elected has done nothing to reduce the unemployment rate. It is interesting to note that 18 months into this first term of office of the Howard government, it is a government in disarray when it comes to the issue of jobs. I refer to a few facts. I know the government does not like to hear these facts when it comes to the issue of jobs and the all important question of unemployment and security in people's lives. Unemployment fell by more than a full percentage point in the last 18 months of the Keating Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, what has occurred in the first 18 months of the Howard government? It is interesting to note that it has not fallen but, more importantly, despite the fact that the Prime Minister when pressed, was first to concede that he had inherited a strong economy, it has actually risen by 0.3 percentage points in the first 18 months of the Howard government. I dare suggest that if the Howard government had managed the strong economy that it inherited we would have been talking about, at the end of this three&hyphen;year period of government, an unemployment rate of seven per cent or so&mdash;not 8.7 per cent, as we are now talking about 18 months in, effectively half of a normal term of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet John Howard, the Prime Minister, has on several occasions said that he sees unemployment as the key issue in Australia at the moment. I think it is about time that he started talking about the issue of unemployment and about realistic solutions. Not only has unemployment risen in the first 18 months 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8073"> of this term of parliament&mdash;it is worse than that&mdash;the plight of the long-term unemployed has got worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week we saw the unemployment figures for the month of August. They show that there is no relief in sight. I know that the minister for employment likes to look at the clouds and hope that the drought breaks in the near future, but the figures of last week show that there is no relief in sight. Long-term unemployment&mdash;people unemployed for 12 months or more&mdash;last week reached a 28-month high. There are now 247,700 Australians who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. That is the highest number of long-term unemployed people in Australia since the month of April 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that for every consecutive month since May of last year, when the Labor Party's jobs programs were cut, long-term unemployment has grown in Australia. Yet the member for La Trobe, in speaking to the bill prior to my contribution, indicated that he believes that the bill and its impact on the industrial relations front will create a better environment for job growth in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to some of the other changes on the budget front that the Howard government has made since it was elected in March of last year. Last August we had the first Howard government budget. It was going to set all the parameters for Australia and overcome the unemployment crisis. I would have thought that full-time employment would have seen some improvement if we had listened and believed the Prime Minister in August of last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those figures also came out recently, in the last 10 days. It is an absolute disgrace. Since that first budget of August last year we have seen 60,000 full-time jobs disappear from Australia. That is a huge loss of important, permanent full-time jobs in Australia. So much for the government's commitment to overcoming unemployment and the so-called impact of these potential changes on the industrial relations front. As if 60,000 full-time jobs since August of last year were not bad enough, we also recently had the unemployment figures for the month of August. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They show that we lost 38,200 jobs in August. As if that were not devastating enough, 37,500 of those jobs were full-time jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a devastating record. There is a jobs crisis in Australia and all this government can talk about is further labour market deregulation, further insecurity in people's lives. That was clarified and put beyond any doubt at a recent CEDA meeting where the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, spoke in the following terms. At that meeting, she said: `You have to have a freer industrial relations system. You have to have&mdash;it might be described as&mdash;lessened job security.' Then she went on to say: `That basically means strong unfair dismissal laws, making it difficult for small business to swap people over.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and others inclined to that ideology of labour market deregulation claim that America's currently low official unemployment rate is due to its flexible industrial relations system. They forget that any comparison between Australia's and America's official unemployment rates is highly questionable, given the huge number of Americans in gaol and their exclusion from the official labour market figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason the US has long had one of the lower official unemployment rates in the OECD is that of a desperate response by its citizens to falling living standards. A whole new class of working poor has been created in America. We say loudly and clearly that American society is not a desirable model for Australia. We do not, for instance, want Australian workers to have to beg for tips because they do not have a decent award wage system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, by contrast, on returning from his recent trip to America told the Australian unemployed that all their problems would be over if they would just uproot themselves from their families and communities and move to where the work was, just as he refused to move from Sydney to Canberra to take up the job of Prime Minister of Australia. Like the supposedly mobile American population, he ought to think about that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say is that, although the Prime Minister did not move from Sydney to Canberra, I am not sure whether he expects Australia's unemployed to move. Does he, for example, expect the 2,000 sacked steelworkers at BHP Newcastle to uproot themselves and their families and move? Does he seriously expect that, if they did, they would immediately fill the slightly larger number of job vacancies which exist in very different industries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister and the people from whom he gets his economic advice unfortunately do not understand that what we have come to call the labour market is not a simple issue of goods and services. It involves people. I suggest to him that people are more complex than commodities and they are not as mobile as capital. Unfortunately for unemployed Australians, he has no suggestions about how to tackle unemployment. Giving the Employment Advocate more powers will not help to create jobs. It will only add to people's insecurities, further undermine the award system and ensure that the low paid in this community, who need a helping hand from the Industrial Relations Commission, are denied that helping hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister should not bother tinkering at the edges of a marginal position like the Employment Advocate. Instead, he should restore a real role for the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party opposes the bill. The bill will do nothing to improve industrial relations in Australia. It will do nothing to create those very necessary jobs that Australians are looking for at the moment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 was presented in the parliament by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) on 26 June this year. It amends the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and makes a number of technical improvements to that bill relating to certified agreements, Australian workplace agreements and the Employment Advocate, the no&hyphen;disadvantage test, termination of employment, freedom of association, preference clauses, union disamalgamation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and matters referred to the Commonwealth by Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the shadow minister, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) have attempted to justify the Labor record since 1983 and, what I think is even more revealing, have attempted to justify their `back to the future' policy. They seem to think that they can have one policy when they are in government and another when they are in opposition. I do not happen to think the Australian people will fall for that line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is along the same lines as that of the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). If we believe in this country that the old industrial relations club of the ACTU, the Industrial Relations Court and the ALP can offer a better choice to the Australian workplace than the millions of Australians who are actually out there working in the workplace, with their employers, then we must think again. It is a proven and known fact that the Keating government moved down the path of a more deregulated labour market. In fact, going back as far as the Hawke prime ministership, this deregulatory approach was seen as our best hope in an emerging market economy in the international trading environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Politics is part of all of our lives as we come to this place, but ultimately the responsibility is to provide the best possible standard of living and the best opportunities for every Australian. We would expect to have genuine debate and genuine differences about how we might do that among the historic parties of this parliament, but there are some fundamentals which we cannot escape. For example, the member for Batman referred to the minimum wage of four categories of workers: $359 to $366, whether you are a hospitality worker, a child&hyphen;care worker or a process worker. I would submit that, as someone who has worked for most of my working life for less than that, it is far better to offer people the opportunity to have a wage than to confine them to the welfare system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought it was quite revealing when the member for Batman talked about the unemployment numbers, saying that those who have been unemployed for 12 months or more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8075"> were, at 247,000, at their highest level since April 1995. As I recall it, the Hawke&hyphen;Keating government started in 1983, so there is obviously some implication there that there was significantly higher unemployment back over that period. That is not something that I dwell on with pride or with any sense of gloating, but I think we have to be realistic enough in this place to acknowledge that the previous government in no way had the answers. We will never forget what Mr Keating said when he was at his peak as the Treasurer of the day: the `recession we had to have'. It just showed the difficulty that governments have, particularly the Labor government, in coming to terms with how we actually deal with the issue of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accusation is made of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that he is not coming to terms with changing realities. Let us look at what the Prime Minister's realities were when he came into office&mdash;a man who has given well over 20 years of political service to the parliament of this country; a man for whom I have enormous respect, especially his undiluted commitment to the issues of Australia over that period; and a man who, through a whole range of adversities, came to be Prime Minister in March 1996. Let us look at the changing realities that he and the cabinet have had to deal with. The deficit is well documented. There has been a long period of high interest rates. There is a long history of balance of payments problems and a history of a culture which had, for too long, relied on welfare. There is a long history of a Canberra centralism which did not show sufficient respect for the workplace and for the regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been criticism of the Prime Minister because he chooses to keep his family home in Sydney rather than in Canberra, but that is something that is welcomed by most Australians particularly when we realise that Sydney is one of the great hubs of Australia in terms of commercial activity and employment. With all due respect to Canberra, it is a place that we come to almost to be part of this federal parliament. In my opinion, it does not have the same focus in a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> practical way on the real solutions for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Passing comment has been made about the drought in jobs. The plain truth of it is that there has been a significant drought problem within this country over the last few months, which no doubt has contributed to the disappointing figures of last month. I believe there has been a much greater problem than the El Nino effect, and that is the drought of positive and constructive ideas over the last 15 years as to how we might come to terms with our unemployment problems. I believe the answers lie in the framework and in the foundation laid down by this government over the last 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the Australian people are going to be easily swayed from their understanding that the previous Labor government had at least 13 years to resolve many of these issues. As has been discussed in this debate over the last hour, very clearly the previous Labor government had set a course on a more deregulated labour market. So let us not have any more of this humbug of the belief that by regulating more somehow or other you are going to create more jobs and more secure jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note also the reference to independent contractors and the reference to casual employment. It gives me no pleasure to inform that House that I, as a self&hyphen;employed person and a very small employer, really found the task of employing back as early as the mid&hyphen;1970s far too difficult in my business, a fragile business at the best of times in dry, low rainfall country in terms of the agricultural and farming business. Very few people on the Labor side of the parliament have an understanding of what it is to be an employer and what it is to run a business. It is too easy to be critical of the employer and of the entrepreneur and of the businessman. I do not think the Labor Party are deliberately anti&hyphen;business. I hope they are not and in fact I am sure most of them are not. But please remember that flowery rhetoric in this place does not create one more job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge the shadow minister and the member for Batman, the former ACTU president, to show me where at any point in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8076"> their working lives they have created jobs or run a business. That is still the core of future employment in Australia. There has been some discussion about social allocation of resources. I keep repeating this theme: the greatest social allocation of resources that this parliament can give to the people of Australia is to allocate an economy which can provide jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not dwell too much on regulation. It is true to say that the issues around occupational health and safety and workers compensation are important to the welfare of the workplace, but let us never forget the basic: it is absolutely pointless having these regulations if you have not created a climate which maximises the opportunity for people to have a job. If people do not have a job, then all those other issues become absolutely irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister made reference to powerful unions. I have never been a member of a trade union, but I have been a member of a farmers union and I have always valued that association as a means of understanding my industry and understanding the pressures on my industry and in negotiating from time to time with government or other industry sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply put to the parliament and to the Labor Party to please think again if we believe that we are going to overcome the unemployment issues of Australia just by having powerful unions. We have a powerful union in Australia called the Maritime Union of Australia. There is much evidence to suggest that that union over much of its life and activity in Australia has denied many thousands of Australians the opportunity to work. I did not realise until I came into this place that the monopoly was such that, if I wanted to be a waterside worker and earn the sort of salary which until recent years I could only dream about, the only way I could do it was by having some birthright.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the industry that I come from, over the last decade up to 50 per cent of the neighbours in my own community have gone broke or have left the land. I find it quite incredible that we in this country can tolerate that sort of monopoly and that sort of arrogance and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that we have an economy in this country across our wharves which denies thousands of other Australians the opportunity to be employed. I do not understand the union muscle, this powerful union approach. I do not understand why we should deny other Australians opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to note the shadow minister's comments about weakening people's capacity in the workplace and workplace stress. I come back to all the medical evidence across Australia&mdash;all the evidence that anybody would want to offer. The greatest stress on individuals in this country&mdash;it is well documented&mdash;is to be unemployed for a long period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to a time in Australia's history which I have done a little bit of reading on. It is the days of the Depression in the thirties. With the experience of a world war, who knows what went through the minds of the leaders of the time. Two men in South Australia, Tom Playford and Clyde Cameron, who were from either side of the political fence, were able to agree on a relationship which appeared to me and to many other South Australians to build a state based on commonsense and a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know how many people realised that Clyde Cameron was a union representative who was able to get a very significant increase in union membership in the days when unionism was not compulsory. I am sure Tom Playford and Clyde Cameron did not agree on all things, but I think they both had enough decency and commonsense to understand the realities and to know what was in the best interests of their community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just hope that in time the Labor Party and its leadership will be able to bring to this place and to the Australian people a much more constructive approach to the issues of unemployment and to the issues of industrial relations and to bring them forward in a way which acknowledges their contribution to unemployment since 1983 when they came into power. I thought their contribution was in some ways positive, particularly in the latter years of that administration when they talked about enterprise bargaining. There was a clear recognition.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8077">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will never forget Paul Keating's address to one of the employer groups in I think mid&hyphen;1993. He said that we must move forward, we must move away from this centralised system and we must have a stronger enterprise bargaining base to give our economy a better chance. Over that period we have seen it shrinking and going back, to a point where we now have something which is barely recognisable from those policies of the Labor Party in the early 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would just conclude by making the comment that I welcome the changes in the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 . I compliment the minister. I think we are fortunate to have someone so dedicated and capable. I believe that, given time and the support of the employers and the work force, we can see positive things come from this in the time ahead.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to listen to the previous speaker, the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin). Again, like so many speakers on behalf of the government, he spoke about confrontation and not about achieving outcomes in the interests of the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997  itself makes some quite objectionable amendments, albeit to many separate areas of provisions in the Workplace Relations Act. The first is in respect of the enhanced powers of entry given to the Employment Advocate. It makes this so-called fair agent to be someone more in the nature of a secret policeman with extraordinary powers of entry to ascertain information regarding any possible agreement with employers as to union membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the bill makes amendments to a system of industrial relations which is itself objectionable. It weakens the only controls that were in place on the role of the Employment Advocate in approving Australian workplace agreements. The Employment Advocate is not required to give any reasons for accepting or rejecting Australian workplace agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had an extraordinary situation recently where he refused to give evidence to a Senate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee as to the reasons why he accepts or rejects workplace agreements. Indeed, he refused to provide the committee with any of the agreements that he had so approved or rejected and hence removed himself entirely from any objective scrutiny. That is certainly a very cosy position for any bureaucrat to be in. Of course, we know that the Employment Advocate makes his decisions in a situation where there is no right of intervention of any objective party to voice their argument as to whether the Australian workplace agreements are in accordance with modern industrial norms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's approach in this bill is extremely short-sighted. While the employers will unquestionably have the upper hand in areas where there is high unemployment or in areas where the work force is unskilled, that is certainly not universally the case. Governments throughout modern history have known that unrestrained wages break&hyphen;outs have a devastating economic effect. The first recorded attempt to restrain a wages break&hyphen;out was the 1349 Statute of Labourers which was passed after the great plague wiped out so much of the European population and caused a labour shortage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since that time there have been labour shortages because of war or other economic circumstances. But it is not only those economic or historical circumstances that result in a situation where labour has the upper hand and the opportunity to cause a wages break-out. While we do have high unemployment in a great number of industries in Australia&mdash;indeed, in the majority of industries&mdash;we still have a number of very affluent sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the communications sector; we have the mining sector which, by and large, is still affluent with high levels of employment; and we have the petroleum industry with high levels of employment. It is fair to say that workers in those industries, unionised workers, have the upper hand and if Australian workplace agreements are struck they are beyond the scrutiny which previously existed where the commission was required to consider certified agreements or enterprise flexibility agreements in terms of the public interest, including the flow&hyphen;on consequences 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8078"> and what productivity offsets may have been in the equation to justify wage increases. But there is now no scrutiny because the Employment Advocate has no accountability. He simply approves the Australian workplace agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The reason this government is so short-sighted is that removing agreements from scrutiny necessarily means removing all agreements from objective vetting, including those ones where workers will have the capacity to cause wages break&hyphen;outs. Those wages break&hyphen;outs are not necessarily going to be confined to those specific industries. They invariably have flow-on consequences. That is where this government is so naive and shows such short-sightedness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government has an industrial relations framework perhaps suitable, from its perspective, to limited sectors in the historical and economic circumstances that confront Australia at the present time with high unemployment, that is not going to be the case in perpetuity. The whole tide will swing back, and the government will be caught short. I think it is fair to say that one of the reasons the Liberal government lost power in the early 1980s was that a wages break&hyphen;out under the former Fraser government in the late 1970s led to the economic recession in the early 1980s and hence the demise of the Fraser government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government may well live to repeat that history, but the whole point is that it is being incredibly naive and short-sighted in its approach. Aside from those industries that are prosperous because of specialist skills or specific economic circumstances, what measures, what weapons or what tools does this government have to cope with what will be the inevitable situation in the building industry in Sydney as we get close to the year 2000 Olympics?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naive Neddy will tell anyone that the shortage of labour in the building industry is going to result in massive pressures for a wages break&hyphen;out in the industry. The government has no answer. The government will not even be able to look at any agreements struck between employers and workers in those industries. It will not be able to do anything 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about it. Again, this is where the government is so incredibly naive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Restricting the powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to making minimum rates awards has been futile. It means that the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is removed, effectively, because it does not have the power to resolve the actuality of the dispute. The disputes invariably are at a level considerably higher than the minimum rate of pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted with some alarm the statement of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) to the Channel Ten program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> on Sunday 21 September. I think the minister's words were `resort to the commission is three&hyphen;quarters of the problem'. With the greatest respect to the minister, his comments are misguided, unfair and demonstrate complete stupidity, the likes of which has never been seen before on the part of any Australian industrial relations minister. He just does not know the reality of industrial relations, and he has clearly been spooked by comments by the H.R. Nicholls Society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has provided a unique service to this nation, resolving complex industrial disputes. The competent commissioners&mdash;and there are many&mdash;have an instinct for weighing up the hidden agendas of both parties. Whether they are internal political machinations within the union or whether they are internal power plays within the employer, they have the knack to cut through all that and get to the crux of the problem. If there is no prospect of compromise, in the past they have had the power to step in and restore the rule of law to an apparent insoluble crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for an independent arbitrator in terms of resolving labour disputes was appreciated as early as 1746, with legislation giving justices of the peace jurisdiction to settle labour disputes between masters and servants. The minister would have probably liked those days because, until 1867, those justices of the peace had the power to gaol servants for breaching their labour contracts. As I am talking about time warps, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8079"> minister would probably have some empathy with the comments by the General Manager of Rio Tinto in 1937. Sir Auckland Geddes told the company shareholders at their annual general meeting when talking about the fascists taking control in Spain where Rio Tinto had a mine:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the mining district was occupied by General Franco's forces, there have been no further labour problems. Miners found guilty of trouble making are court martialled and shot.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is one way of solving industrial relations problems, but it is not the Australian way that has developed over the last 97 years since the constitutional forefathers developed the power of this parliament to prevent and resolve industrial disputes. This government, by its legislation, has effectively removed that constitutional power or at least nullified it during its period of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Thursday I read with interest a newspaper headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>: `Welcome to arbitration nineties style'. It was a reference to the appointment of Geoffrey Giudice as the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. That was indeed an appropriate reference: `Welcome to arbitration nineties style' because it is 1890s style. This is the precise history that occurred in the 1890s before our constitutional forefathers gave federal parliament the power to resolve industrial disputes. They are exactly the same issues&mdash;the issues about so-called freedom of contract and union busting tactics on the part of employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our constitutional forefathers saw the massive economic devastation that that period of intense industrial conflict caused. They said that something had to be done about it. There had to be introduced the rule of law into a situation of industrial anarchy. Last week, rather than encouraging and advocating the rule of law in bringing about commonsense, the government was standing at the edge of a bushfire throwing petrol on the fire, saying to the firemen, `Stay right away from this fire; let her erupt, let her go.' We are waiting now to see where that bushfire takes us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of that headline about arbitration nineties style, the minister recently adopted the catch-cry that we have now come to an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> era where management have the right to manage their own enterprises. What he is talking about is not so much the rebirth but the misconception of managerial prerogative. Let us again look at the time warp that the minister is in. I refer to the comments in 1913 of Acting Chief Justice Barton, after whom my seat was named. In terms of this concept of managerial prerogative in respect of the employer in that case, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His freedom to contract in such matters remains to him . . . The employer and not the employed must prevail . . . the decision what to do with his own property and therefore the conduct of it, belongs to the employer . . . </PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So we are not talking about 1990s concepts; we are talking about 1913 concepts. In terms of the morality that has developed in Australia regarding so-called managerial prerogative, there has been a recognition that workers have a legitimate interest, and indeed right, to have a say in their employment destinies. More recently, Justice Wilson said in the Federated Clerks case on this same topic:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . consultation between employers and employees, preceded by the distribution of adequate information, is not only sensible but essential if commerce and industry are to meet the challenge of progress in a spirit of harmony and with some regard to human dignity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This government has no regard for human dignity. That is obvious and plain for all to see. The Full Bench of the High Court of Australia said in Cram's case:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No doubt our traditional system of industrial conciliation and arbitration has itself contributed to a growing recognition that management and labour have a mutual interest in many aspects of the operation of a business enterprise. Many management decisions, once viewed as the sole prerogative of management, are now correctly seen as directly affecting the relationship of employer and employee and constituting an "industrial matter".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This government does not recognise that. Whether something is or is not an industrial matter is quite irrelevant to it. It is saying that the management has open slather. Indeed, it is out there cajoling management to take on workers, despite the fact that in many cases enterprise agreements exist and exist for several more years. This government is effectively trying to induce breaches of contract.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8080">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason this government must attack the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is that, of necessity, if it has cause to intervene in a dispute situation and to arbitrate a fair outcome between the parties, that in itself is of course an interference with management prerogative, because it is not the managers' prerogative that has the ultimate say. But this government is not about achieving a fair outcome where workers have an interest and a say and are consulted with respect to their futures and their security. This government is about compelling workers to negotiate terms of surrender, not about maintaining their working conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would the government go about such a radical change in a situation where Australia has achieved very significant gains in productivity? I have two cases in front of me: a case involving Heinz and a case involving Nestle Australia. These are two cases under the former Labor government's regime where the Australian Industrial Relations Commission actually rejected enterprise agreements because the commission was not satisfied that the productivity offsets offered by the workers was sufficient and, hence, they did not grant the pay rise. That regime applied right through the last decade. Indeed, the proof of the pie is in the eating in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission recently released a research paper assessing Australia's productivity performance. The report of the Productivity Commission found that Australia's productivity over the last decade has been considerably in excess of our OECD competitors. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But performance in the 1990s is even stronger. Even allowing for the effects of the recession, current productivity growth appears to be running at around 2 per cent a year or more. The increase of 2.3 per cent in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">trend </EMPHASIS> series over the latest available year is a very positive sign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although this study has not attempted to investigate the causes of productivity trends, the recent improvement in productivity performance is consistent with the effects of microeconomic and other government reforms coming to fruition. The full effects of reform are likely to continue to unfold over time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">While those improvements are unfolding, that is an objective analysis by any terms. While 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those clear productivity gains are coming to fruition and when we are winning the game, why throw out everything? Why throw out reform and introduce warfare? The only explanation is that this government wants to run to the next election campaign on an industrial relations platform. They are picking off the high wage earners and trying to cause resentment among the lower paid. That is one aspect, but they are actually evoking industrial disputation to give themselves an issue. While they are running to the election for that purpose, they are not running this country in the interests of Australians. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) on this area. His knowledge and background is quite extensive. Indeed, he practised as a solicitor and did a lot of work in this area over a number of years. I certainly do not want to get into a debate about his expertise, nor do I want to be critical of some of the points that he made, some of which were quite fair. I do think that there is, nonetheless, with all due respect to him, a mind-set about industrial reform on that side of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial relations policy and reform is something that is needed in this country as part of a total package of trying to improve the economy. It is one facet&mdash;and an important one&mdash;of trying to improve the economy, trying to create more employment and trying to develop a fair and equitable system that does not have a section of the work force in a really privileged position as opposed to another section of the work force which has similar skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the areas that the opposition does not seem to want to address in this debate. Take, for example, the waterfront. To me, it is incredible that in 1997 workers on the waterfront control how many people work, for example, in Cairns. There is a control on the numbers. Even the previous government, in 1990, as we heard, attempted to break those shackles. It is the union, not the employer who was good enough to offer these people a job, who says, `There shall be X number of workers on the waterfront.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8081">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That concept, that notion, has no place in Australian society, in my view, in 1997, nor does a section of the work force getting benefits that are out of kilter with any other section of the work force. It has been said&mdash;and I think quite fairly&mdash;by the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) that executive salaries are also outrageous. I agree with him that in some areas they are outrageous. Some of the amounts that executives have received&mdash;and, indeed, it has been said that they have granted to themselves&mdash;are really not fair and equitable. Nobody can justify granting and receiving such incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is an argument there. But that is not an argument for there to be no reform. It is all very well to say that you want to reform the waterfront or reform the construction industry, but you have to look at the executive salaries. You cannot hold up the reform of thousands on the basis of what may be seen as excessive salaries paid to a few. Nonetheless, that is a matter that is justifiable to mention, but it should not hold up the reform process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened to most of the speeches in this debate and it seems to me that when we are looking at this area we always seem to go back to the past. We think there might be a wages break out, that there might be flow-on consequences or that we need the AIRC because we have always had the AIRC&mdash;we think it is essential because we have always had it. We always go back to the circular argument: we have always had it, therefore it is essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think that argument holds water any more. The argument treats workers like buffoons, like people who cannot contract on their own behalf. Many of the business people in my electorate take the view, `Why do we have any unfair dismissal law? I don't want to dismiss a worker who is an asset to my business. Why would I? I want to hold on to that worker. That worker is a priceless asset. But I do want to get rid of somebody who is dragging my business down.' So those business people say to me, `Why do we have that law?' I suppose we have to strike compromise on so many things, and that is one area where 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a compromise was struck. But I appreciate the force of their argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose I should refer to a number of these amendments&mdash;and they have been referred to by the other side as not so technical amendments. I would suggest, with respect, that they are technical amendments relating to certified agreements, Australian workplace agreements, the Employment Advocate, the no disadvantage test, termination of employment, freedom of association, union disamalgamation and the Commonwealth jurisdictional matters referred to by Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at what changes, if any, have occurred under the new act, I would suggest that in some areas those changes have not worked through to the extent that one would have hoped. I say that in particular about the construction industry. I was in a rather lengthy conversation with an employer in that industry when the new act was proposed. He took the view that any real change in that area would not be brought about easily and that the act, while laudable in its goals, would not provoke the sort of change that was needed to flow through to the smaller subcontractors and people of that nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, think of a single subcontractor in the construction industry who has a few employers and reached agreements with those employees. He tenders for a particular subcontract on a large building site. When the head contractor looks at the situation and is reminded by the construction union that these people are not union members and that they are not particularly happy with the sorts of conditions that they have accepted, how will the head contractor take to the potential for a dispute, which might only be a little one but one which could close the whole job down?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can see the forces that are at work there that could very easily be brought into play to shut out the little subcontractor and thereby continue the perpetuation of the system. Unfortunately, it seems the practice is continuing in the construction industry. Reform is needed in that area. The reform is needed so that more people will ultimately be employed. That is really the bottom line here. That is what we are talking about. The old 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8082"> saying of the former member for Melbourne Ports, Frank Crean, `One man's pay rise is another man's job,' is still the case today. People forget that he was the person who said that, but it is still the case today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate, as the member for Barton observed before, that those in work who are contemplating more rounds of wage rises and negotiations for better working conditions sometimes forget that there are a lot of people out there&mdash;some of them their former mates&mdash;who are on the dole and not facing a very bright future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the act are largely supported by the ACTU and the opposition, notwithstanding some of the overall general comments that have been made. They are also generally supported by the ACCI. The changes will give effect to the major reforms of the Workplace Relations Act. Over 1,600 new agreements have been certified since this act came into force on 1 January, 47 agreements have been made directly between employers and employees and over 500 Australian workplace agreements have been approved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments reflect the legislative objective of having the parties reach an agreement without arbitration. An unintended consequence of limiting access to arbitration is that it may prevent the commission from varying an award to include a safety net adjustment. The amendment makes it clear that the limitation on the commission does not prevent the commission from exercising its arbitral powers to deal with an application to vary an award to include a safety net wage adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The time period for the approval of an agreement is 14 days. The time will not be extended if the employer takes on new staff during the approval period. The agreement and its effect have to be explained to the new staff. This avoids delay and the expense of having to restart the approval period each time new staff are hired. In effect, if this provision were not amended the time limit for the approval could stretch out indefinitely. What would happen if, for example, new staff were employed 13 days into the approval time? The time starts again. What happens then if another staff member is employed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> during that period? Do the time periods keep continuing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACTU would rather the AIRC be given the ability to waive the time limit if it believes it would unreasonably prolong approval and was not being used as a device to avoid the approval process or to allow new employees five days to consider the agreement. Again, this would cause unnecessary delays. This brings about all sorts of problems as to what the definition of `unreasonably' would amount to. A subjective test, such as the ACTU is suggesting, opens the matter up to court proceedings for the determination of its meaning. As happens in most court cases there are varied opinions as to what this particular word means. No doubt both sides would interpret the word differently. The amendment makes it clear and not open to further debate between the parties that the period to consider the agreement is to be 14 days. Both parties know exactly where they stand. A decision one way or the other will be made within that 14&hyphen;day period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present situation in relation to authorised officers who are investigating possible freedom of association breaches is that they can only enter premises where they believe relevant documents may be located. Officers investigating Australian workplace agreement breaches and department of industrial relations inspectors investigating breaches of awards or certified agreements may enter premises where relevant work is being performed and interview employees without being limited to premises where documents may be held. The amendment corrects the anomaly&mdash;authorised officers may enter places of business for the purpose of interviewing persons in connection with possible breaches of the freedom of association provisions of the act. No access to a private  home is permitted and the right to interview does not mean that the person is compelled to answer. In my view this amendment is a fair one. If an investigation can sort something out in the early stage and warnings be given it is then less costly to both parties and avoids problems in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through a constituent inquiry I have recently had contact with the Employment Advocate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8083"> to resolve what may have evolved into quite a major dispute between one of my constituents and her employer. The constituent was not required to join a union, which satisfies the freedom of association test. However, in lieu of paying the union fees the constituent was required to make a donation to charity. The constituent had no problem with this. However, when informed that the donation was far in excess of union fees and was required up front the constituent felt that she had no choice other than to join the union as she could not avoid making the required donation to the charity. Investigations by the Employment Advocate rectified the problem and a warning was given to the employer about this sort of behaviour. It was a major employer, by the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see that time is advancing. I did have a few more matters to refer to but, generally speaking, these amendments are to be welcomed. It seems that both sides generally agree with these particular amendments. There has been a reservation mentioned by the member for Canberra. It has to be remembered when one has heard some of the contributions from members opposite that industrial relations law and the industrial relations system are not sacrosanct. The people of Australia are looking for change; they are looking for flexibility. The Workplace Relations Act is the first step in that direction but there are a lot more steps to go. It is only one small step. In the ultimate scenario I believe that these amendments and more, we would hope, in the future will bring about a system of industrial relations that will benefit the people of Australia and will produce more jobs for those people who are unable to get work. I commend the government amendments to the House and oppose the opposition amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before calling the first speaker, I wish to make a statement. I indicat 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed to the House earlier this afternoon during question time that I would reflect on one of the issues. I have reflected upon events during question time earlier today surrounding claims that an answer by Minister Kemp contained interpretations which a member had earlier claimed to be a misrepresentation of the member's comments. The matter has been raised with me on two separate earlier occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 5 June 1997, the member for Sydney took a point of order during a minister's answer to the effect that attributions should be placed in context and in the light of other quotations. Later, during a personal explanation, the member advanced an interpretation on his comments different to that of the minister. On 17 June, the minister again quoted the member for Sydney, who at the time was absent, and a number of points of order were taken that the member for Sydney had earlier made a personal explanation which disproved the minister's conclusions. I advised the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not in a position to ascertain the facts relative to a ministerial answer. I am not in a position to determine the truth or otherwise of the ministerial assertion. There are other forms available . . . to seek redress, and if it is appropriate the member can make a personal explanation at the end of question time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 25 August 1997, in similar circumstances, I invited the minister to address the substance of the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier today, when the matter arose again, I asked the minister to return to the thrust of the question, to avoid revisiting the topic and not return to the particular statement that was the subject of a personal explanation. Subsequently, I undertook to deliberate further on the matter and report back to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of further consideration, I advise the House that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> at page 477 includes among expressions which are, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">May's Parliamentary Practice</EMPHASIS> considered unparliamentary, the misrepresentation of the language of another and the accusation of misrepresentation. An examination of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">May</EMPHASIS> reveals that it has been held that the accusation must be a deliberate misrepresentation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8084">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An examination of Australian practice on the matter reveals little. The only instance readily to hand occurred in 1989 when the member for Watson, as Deputy Speaker, was asked by the then Leader of the Opposition as to any penalties which might exist where members make personal explanations only to find the explanation to be ignored and the quotations or references used in a public or private forum. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 6 April 1989 at page 1,155, Deputy Speaker McLeay replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I understand it, the provisions of the standing orders are that a Member can continue to rebut any allegation that is made but I do not think there is any constraint upon a person making an allegation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It has been and remains my belief that the chair is not in a position to determine the truth or otherwise of assertions by members, and there are other forms available for redress, such as a personal explanation or a substantive motion. However, the House has an obligation to prevent the continuation of a quarrel among members, pursuant to standing order 79, and this is at least the third time since June this year that the interpretation of the comments has been the subject of disagreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat my invitation to the minister not to revisit such claims in detail. I would consider a reference in passing to be acceptable. Given the precedent involving the member for Watson, my powers of compulsion are somewhat limited. Should the minister choose not to accept my invitation, the member would have recourse to alternative methods of redress.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8084"><TITLE>Second Sydney Airport: Badgerys Creek</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) promised a draft environmental impact statement process on Badgerys Creek which was not only open and above board, but a study that was comprehensive, with no stone left unturned. Given the revelations contained in the NSW Environment Protection Agency's report into Badgerys Creek, which was released over the weekend during a large protest meeting, the Howard government's supposedly transparent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and fair EIS process now stands exposed once again as a complete and utter sham.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the New South Wales Environment Protection Agency report has exposed the minister and his promises for what they really are, and that is fraudulent. Following the minister's decision to reject Holsworthy as a site for Sydney's second airport, he stated about Badgerys Creek in this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The draft EIS completely dispels the concerns that many of us had when we came into office in regard to Badgerys Creek airport. The draft EIS clearly indicates that Badgerys Creek is a superior site. It also indicates that Holsworthy is an inferior site for a second airport for Sydney when compared with Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was on 3 September this year. Only yesterday he reiterated his position by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage, there's nothing that appears in the draft that would stop us from building an airport at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And yet the report from the New South Wales Environment Protection Agency quite clearly states in regard to Badgerys Creek that an airport at the site could have:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A disproportionate impact on photochemical smog. . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It quite clearly states that an airport at Badgerys Creek would be a major source of the pollutant, nitrogen dioxide. It goes even further. The report also says that noise levels at an airport at Badgerys Creek would be `significant' and that `many people would experience noise levels that would exceed Australian standards.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why do we have the minister saying here, `Nothing's wrong. Badgerys Creek is fine. If we could go ahead with it right now, we would do it.'? I will tell you why: we now have a minister who will say and do anything, who will stop at nothing, in order to get Badgerys Creek off the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of a monstrosity is the minister for transport willing to inflict upon the people of western Sydney? To what lengths is he prepared to go to see a second international airport built within the Sydney basin in the next several years? Judging by the EPA report, the minister for transport is obviously quite willing to inflict the same outrageous noise levels on the people of western Sydney 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8085"> as those continually being suffered by many people living around Kingsford Smith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is obviously quite willing to inflict greater levels of pollution on the people of western Sydney, with all the consequences that such an increase would bring&mdash;a rapid rise in the already large number of our young children suffering asthma in the region being just one of those. He is obviously quite willing to bulldoze this airport through whatever the cost, whatever the consequences, and the people of western Sydney, he says, be damned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To top it all off, I believe deep down that, despite the minister for transport's assurances that Badgerys Creek is the best site for an airport, he knows quite well the negative results contained in the New South Wales EPA report are correct. He knows the sort of damage he will do to western Sydney should he manage to steamroll this airport through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why else is he insisting on releasing the full results of the draft EIS in December&mdash;coinciding with the Christmas&hyphen;New Year holiday period in Australia&mdash;and then exhibiting it for only 12 weeks? The draft EIS is a long and complex document. If my information is correct, it includes some 15 technical papers. Why is the minister for transport willing to reveal its contents only during a time when many western Sydney residents are away from their homes on holiday or while many are caught up in finalising their very important family arrangements for the Christmas&hyphen;New Year period break? Why is the minister only allowing 12 weeks viewing time when, if he was being realistic, he would allow six months in order to give all interested parties the opportunity to adequately prepare their submissions on the draft?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have the minister and this government really got to hide? I believe it is because the minister for transport knows exactly what he is dealing with in regard to Badgerys Creek. I believe he knows what sort of permanent scar he is going to leave on the outskirts of some of the most populous areas of Sydney if he builds this airport. I believe he knows what sort of damage he is going to do to the health and wellbeing of many Australians who 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be forced to live under 24&hyphen;hour flight paths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales Minister for the Environment quite rightly said yesterday that the New South Wales state government would have `nothing to do' with Badgerys Creek. I urge the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett) and the member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey) to listen to their constituents, many of whom were at yesterday's Blacktown Civic Centre rally, and confront the Minister for Transport and Regional Development and the Howard government and urge them to take the same action before it is too late. There are other alternatives that should be considered. This airport must not go in the Sydney basin.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8085"><TITLE>Monaro District

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I spoke this afternoon in the grievance debate on the situation in Cooma and on the Monaro in general. I did not quite finish the remarks I wanted to make. I spoke about the application of exceptional circumstances as a result of the many adverse events that have happened one on top of the other in that region over the last four or five years. The area has been in drought for four or five years and has suffered very low prices in wool and beef, and the net effect has been quite disastrous in many ways. I went on to say how this crisis not only has impacted on the farmers of the region but also has impacted quite substantially on the town of Cooma.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also referred to another impact on Cooma, which was the closing of the gaol by the New South Wales Labor government. I found this closure very puzzling as this gaol, which is for sex and drug offenders, has operated very successfully for many years. I started to quote some evidence in relation to that from Professor Freda Briggs of Early Childhood and Family Studies at the University of South Australia. She wrote, back in 1993, to the Commissioner for Corrective Services in New South Wales after carrying out research at Cooma Gaol on the particular sex offender program that they operated there called the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8086"> SOAP program, sex offender assessment program. I quoted her on how excellent that course was and how good the results were. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have written to the Executive Director of DCS South Australia informing him of our findings, as I am convinced that your model is worthy of emulation. I do realise, however, that your achievements are the result of many years of solid teamwork by a group of committed experts, along with highly professional, humane custodial personnel. This kind of teamwork and expertise cannot be easily reproduced elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware that some people in Child Protection Services oppose the allocation of funds to the SOAP program and they would prefer that the money be used for victims. This is a case of putting the cart before the horse. You are obviously operating on a shoestring budget, and yet there are enormous benefits arising from it. The program should clearly be expanded rather than curtailed. Incarcerated sex offenders have often damaged hundreds of lives, and without a program such as yours will damage many more.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the letter from Professor Briggs to Corrective Services on how successful the program was. But the New South Wales Labor government have said that they cannot provide the necessary program there, that they do not have the expertise. It has obviously worked; the reoffending rate is virtually zilch for those offenders. But they have decided to move them all and spread them around the mainstream gaols in Sydney, and as a consequence have taken $3 million or $4 million out of the economy of Cooma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have a letter from the Commissioner of the Department of Corrective Services to the Governor of the Cooma Gaol at the time, saying, `Here is a copy of the letter from Professor Briggs.' It adds, `My personal congratulations to you and your staff on a job well done.' That is the hard&hyphen;core evidence, but the New South Wales government says, `Oh no, we cannot provide the goods.' I say it is puzzling, and I think many questions should be asked by a lot of people as to why they have pulled that gaol out of Cooma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Cooma is a very stoic town. It has had that suffering from the rural recession and the drought they have had for four or five years, plus now 60 people and $3 million or $4 million out of Cooma from the closure of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gaol. It is fighting back. Last Thursday night I attended the launch of their development prospectus. They have put together a great team of a development committee made up of young business people of the town who really see a future, and they are fighting ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also learned in the last week that their abattoir has closed, which is another 50 or 60 jobs. But the good sign is that in six months time we should see a high&hyphen;tech export abattoir replace that, with about 120 jobs. So the hardy people of Cooma and the Monaro will ultimately win, and they will have my support all the way.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8086"><TITLE>Mother Teresa of Calcutta</TITLE>

Put another way, the money lost on gambling is almost what state and federal governments spend on the nation's public hospital system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments will be reluctant to do a great deal about our growing addiction to poker machines, casinos and more traditional forms of betting when you consider that the states are now receiving more than $3 billion in revenue from them&mdash;more than 10 per cent of total tax receipts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The supporters of the casino culture argue that much of the money is spent on worthwhile community programs.

When you add to that the importance we place upon gambling, I think it suggests that we need to have a long, hard look at the kinds of values we are adopting. In fact, I have often thought that the problem with young people today is not that they have not learned our values but that they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The marketing strategy for casinos is encapsulated by Crown Casino which invites patrons to have `the time of your life'. The implication is that if you want to enjoy yourself you must be a part of this particular activity. The reality which life delivers for most young people in particular cruelly short&hyphen;changes them. And then we wonder why many prefer the high of a drug to unclouded consciousness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not mind a bet myself. I bought a lottery ticket recently. I certainly do not want a culture of moralistic wowserism. However, it would seem equally clear to me that every society needs a mesh of values and beliefs which hold it together, which sees young people, especially, through the ups and downs of life. The gambling culture represents one of a rapidly increasing number of enlarging holes in this net. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether it is in the context of debate on and reform of Australia's taxation system or whether, more importantly, it is in the context of re-examining the kinds of values we want our country to have, those who profess to lead in Australia, whether it is

That argument, in particular, ought to be strongly repudiated.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8088"><TITLE>Monarchy</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many people have claimed that the circumstances surrounding the death of Diana Spencer and her funeral have no significance to the institution of the monarchy or to the issue of an Australian republic. That claim is patently absurd. The perception of the monarchy and its relevance to contemporary Great Britain has undergone a significant reappraisal. Twenty per cent of the British would abandon the monarchy now. A larger proportion believe it should disappear with the demise of the present incumbent. A majority believe that if it persists the throne should pass to Prince William, bypassing Charles. According to reports, Charles is not amused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two bases of the current reappraisal of the monarchy. The first concerns the relevance of this anachronistic institution with all its associated pomp, pageantry, privilege and inherited wealth. In addition to that, we might question the relevance to contemporary values of an institution that ensures that the British head of state can never be a Catholic or a Buddhist, can never be chosen on the basis of personal qualities and competence, must always be chosen by right of birth and can never be a woman, despite her own qualities and age, if the current monarch has a son, no matter how junior to his older sister he may be, no matter how less intelligent or fitted for the role he may be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is even more objectionable and offensive that these same provisions determine who shall be Australia's head of state. Despite the absurd posturing of the monarchists among us, who claim that the Governor-General is our head of state, they cannot explain why the International Olympic Federation will not allow him or her to open the 2000 Olympics, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8089"> a role that is preserved for the head of state, or why our Governor-General is not accorded head of state status anywhere in the world and is seated behind the princes, presidents and potentates of other countries at any international gathering or forum. Would we have the Queen open the Sydney Olympics and then join the cheer squad for the British contestants?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second basis for reappraisal concerns the qualities and inadequacies of the present incumbents. The exposure of these inadequacies has been encouraged by a less reverent community, an intrusive media and a mass market with an insatiable appetite for titillation. Like 2&half; billion people around the world, I watched the funeral of Diana Spencer. I heard the sobs and cries of anguish from many of the two million who lined the streets to express their affection and, for most, to purge their guilt. Why was Diana Spencer, in the company of her lover in a speeding car driven by a drunk driver, in a Paris tunnel? Why was the former wife of a possible future king of England and the mother of a possible future king of England in such a situation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reasons include the fact that for the institution of the monarchy she had served her purpose. The monarchy needed an heir to the throne. An heir for a whole range of reasons could not be supplied by Mrs Parker&hyphen;Bowles. Having fulfilled her purpose, she was subsequently expelled from The Firm and banished. She was denied a royal title, which would have at least ensured that she would have been provided with proper, continuing protection and security. Diana Spencer was cut adrift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The royal family was not united in grief. Like many of the two million people who lined the streets, they were united in guilt. I have still not heard the Queen say that she grieved or was even sorry about the death of her former daughter-in-law, mother of two of her grandchildren. The royal family was dragged out of Balmoral to retrieve its own image.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us make no mistake: there are many who are taking secret comfort in the knowledge that the possibility has been removed that a future king of England might have had 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an Egyptian shopkeeper for his stepfather, a man denied British citizenship for his step grandfather, and an Arab arms dealer as his step great uncle. Of course, Mohammed Fayed had helped to destroy the last Tory government of John Major by making illicit payments to the former Tory MPs Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith to ask questions of ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disgust of Charles Spencer was apparent in his magnificent eulogy for his sister when he referred to her blood relations and observed that she needed no royal title to do her good deeds. We should remember that those comments were directed against the royal family, and especially the Queen, who is his godmother.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The death of Diana Spencer was tragic. She will always be the young, vibrant, sensitive, beautiful and wronged princess. But her loss to her children is no greater than the loss to the children of any other mother who is tragically killed on the road or anywhere else. The great tragedy surrounding the death of Diana Spencer was that this young woman was betrayed by her husband, expelled and isolated by the royal Firm, hounded and exploited by the media and the public, and left without the care or support, or even the concern, of the family into which she had married and from which she had been so unceremoniously banished.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) This question does not fall within the portfolio responsibilities of my Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) This question does not fall within the portfolio responsibilities of my Department. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) At the medical undergraduate level, the medical schools are responsible for developing and implementing their own curricula. Each medical school is an independent body and they are not directed by the Government on the content of their course. However, we will ensure that the issues regarding palliative care are brought to their notice by sending them the Kasap Report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For all postgraduate medical training the requirements are set by the relevant college, in the case of general practice vocational training it is the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Palliative care has been included in the newly developed Core Curriculum for the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners Training Program (RACGPTP). The Core Curriculum has not yet been implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth response to Recommendation 6 contained in the Stage One Report of the Palliative Care Program Review, conducted by Kasap and Associates Pty Ltd in 1996, is that the Commonwealth will continue to work with the States and Territories, and other key stakeholders, on assessing the education needs of general practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An initiative that will facilitate this is the recently commenced review of General Practice Training. Its aims are to review current education service delivery mechanisms and advise on future needs. This will also include reviewing the arrangements for the delivery of vocational training by the RACGP Training Program; practical support needs for rural vocational training; how hospital experience might be best articulated with GP training; and advising on appropriate linkages between undergraduate and postgraduate general practice education including vocational training and Continuing Medical Education (CME) for general practice. The review is expected to report in early 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Health and Family Services portfolio does not have direct responsibility for post graduate education in palliative care and pain management. This is a responsibility of tertiary education institutions, respective professional organisations and State and Territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is currently conducting a review of palliative care. The Stage 1 Report to the Palliative Care Program Review identified the education of clinicians, both medical and nursing, as a critical factor necessary for the provision of palliative care. The Commonwealth supports this view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Commonwealth does not have direct responsibility for post graduate education, it has lent indirect support through the Palliative Care Program (PCP). The PCP funded a range of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8101"> national projects from 1993-94 to 1996-97 which included the development of: education courses and resources for nurses and allied health professionals; education and support programs for palliative care volunteers; education packages for rural and remote palliative care workers; a national palliative care education and training needs analysis; a pain management guide for general practitioners; and palliative care education packages relating to elderly people, people from culturally diverse backgrounds and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of universities are conducting post graduate courses in palliative care which are available to health professionals. Also, the medical profession is providing post graduate courses through:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Australasian College of Physicians which has a training program in palliative medicine  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and is also currently considering the establishment of a Faculty of Palliative Care. A number of professorial positions have also been estahlishecl across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) which includes pain management as a major area of experience for all specialty trainees. In 1996, the College initiated a Certificate in Pain Management, based upon a post-qualification year of experience in an approved multidisciplinary pain centre which manages acute, chronic and cancer pain. The ANZCA lvill also introduce a Diploma in Pain Management which will commence in 1999. This is currently being finalised and a curriculum is now being developed.</PARA>

The National Drug Strategy does not represent the Commonwealth's total response to the problems of drug and alcohol misuse, nor does it represent the Commonwealth Government's total contribution. The National Drug Strategy did not replace the existing prevention, treatment and law enforcement programming to deal with drug problems. Large amounts of funds outside the National Drug Strategy continue to be spent on the treatment of disease and trauma caused by the misuse of drugs, and for law enforcement efforts to restrict the supply of drugs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Australia currently contributes only a small proportion (around 1.4%) to global greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Government regards the threat of global warming as one of significance and is committed to responding in an effective manner. While we have not conducted research specifically into the impacts of our own contribution to global emissions, Australia has actively participated in the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, particularly, its Second Assessment Report, which reported comprehensively in 1996 on global impacts. The Government has also commissioned several greenhouse related studies in the following areas since April 1995:</PARA>
