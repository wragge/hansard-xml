<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to briefly seek your indulgence, Mr Speaker. Members would be interested to know the likely sitting times in the next 36 hours or thereabouts. I inform the House that our intention tonight is to have the House rise at about 7 p.m., which would be preceded by an adjournment from roughly 6.30 p.m.. We will need to be flexible, depending on the matters before the House at that time. That will allow us to finalise any matters that the Senate has dealt with today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is then our intention to resume tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. Tomorrow the House will have before it matters coming through from the Senate from the close of business today. We will also have a valedictory for Mr Barlin. We would then expect to have an extended and intermittent adjournment debate to allow the House to deal with any matters coming back from the Senate during the day. On our best advice, the Senate could sit as late as midnight tomorrow night. In the event that it is as late as that, allowing time for the transmission of matters from the Senate to the House, the latest that we might then sit to would be 3 a.m.. I think it is in the interest of everybody that we finish tomorrow night, whatever time it is that we finish&mdash;even if it is early in the morning&mdash;so that at least by Saturday morning people will be able to be on their planes and back to their electorates. Obviously, we will be flexible and continue to discuss the matter with the opposition and keep all members informed of progress.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I thank the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) for advising us of that. I would seek from him in relation to Friday whether there will be a question time. We believe that there is a minister that should be in this place now responding to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what he failed to respond to yesterday. We will pursue him today and, if the Leader of the House is not already small business minister by this afternoon, we want the opportunity to pursue matters tomorrow, as well as other issues of importance while this parliament sits. I would ask the Leader of the House to confirm that he will allow a question time on Friday so that the opposition can continue to hold this disreputable government accountable.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek your further indulgence, Mr Speaker. We do enjoy listening to the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean). He is predictable, but that is part of our pleasure and enjoyment as we come to the end of a session. He would not be surprised that I have before me a list of the occasions on which we have had question time on Friday&mdash;I needed a wheelbarrow to bring the precedents in!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to give you some dates: in the spring session in 1990, at 20 December; the autumn session in 1990&mdash;I did not go back further, but I could have&mdash;in 1992, in 1993, in 1994, and in 1995. There are many examples. We are simply following the precedent established by the previous government. In accordance with the precedents, the Friday is a continuation of the Thursday and on that basis there will not be a question time, as has been widely reported and as we all know. The Manager of Opposition Business did not have to ask the question, because I told him beforehand. Thank you very much.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek your further indulgence, Mr Speaker. There is further clarification needed of the statement of the Leader of the House (Mr Reith), because earlier he did say that the House would adjourn tonight. Therefore, one would have thought that there would not be a continuation tomorrow of the adjournment, which he has now just qualified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a further point, I understand the delight that the Leader of the House has in quoting the precedent that our government established. But the reality is that it was your Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who said he was going to lift the standards, that he was going to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6378"> make this parliament more accountable, that the primacy of parliament would be supreme, that there would be more questions and more question times. What shonks! What shallow shonks&mdash;found out for what they are. And what is their excuse? To say, `We're doing what Labor did.' Leader of the House, where is that a lifting of the standards?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we interrupted this debate on the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 last night, I was speaking about the increasing stress that has been taking place in Australian workplaces&mdash;public sector and private sector workplaces and blue&hyphen;collar and white&hyphen;collar workplaces&mdash;and giving some of the evidence that supports that uncontroversial view. I do not think there is anybody who has visited a workplace in Australia in recent times who would not share the view that workers feel under stress and they are reflecting that as one of the priority concerns they have about their workplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the issue of stress, insecurity and uncertainty in workplaces is raised with me more often than the more orthodox issues that one would expect concerning wages and conditions, significant as they are. There is a media fascination, fed by the sorts of anecdotes put out by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) the other day deliberately to provoke this view, that in some way stress is uniquely a Public Service problem, when all the evidence is to the contrary, including the evidence from the minister's own department and in their reports, and that all people off on workplace stress are in some way misusing the system. All the evidence is to the contrary with regard to that. It is not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6381"> that nobody misuses the system. I do not assert that. That has never been true about workers' compensation or any other form of insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have never suggested that we should abolish car insurance because people make rorted claims, as they do, and that people conspire to seek to defraud the insurance companies. We simply make that an offence. If you seek to defraud an insurance company or the Commonwealth, that is a matter which the law should deal with. But we should not deal with it by creating a circumstance in which, when workplace stress is on the rise, some workers who legitimately incur injury at the workplace cannot get access to the workers' compensation system. That is the issue that we are debating here, not whether there is stress&mdash;I am sure everybody agrees with that&mdash;and not whether that stress is increasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, you would have to be blind Freddy not to know that it is increasing in Australian government workplaces because this government is consciously setting out to create the circumstance in which that must be the case. I see it very obviously as the member for Canberra,but it occurs in every part of Australia, because the Commonwealth's public sector activities occur in every part of Australia, but most particularly in the major regional cities where it is a high percentage of the employment of the Bendigos, the Ballarats, the Townsvilles and the Newcastles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of those changes that are taking place are absolutely necessary and appropriate. Some of them are not, but that is not the issue for today. I accept that many of those changes are necessary and appropriate, but they mean that employees are working harder and harder to respond to change and to improve productivity. The government is making a change to make it more difficult for employees to claim compensation for workplace stress. What that means in the public sector is that the government wants to take the benefits of its employees working harder but it does not want to pay for the costs that they incur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake, these proposed changes will make it more difficult for Commonwealth employees to obtain compensation for stress 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and other mental injuries. It does so in two ways. Firstly, the bill will now require that employment contributes to a significant degree to the injury rather than to a material degree, as is presently the case. For most people who have not looked at this, there is a pretty arcane difference. But for affected workers, it can turn out to be very significant. In effect, there will be a substantial increase in the standard of contribution. This is not my interpretation; the bill's definition makes it clear that `significant degree' means substantially more than a material degree. Necessarily, this change will mean that some claims that would otherwise have been successful under the existing law will fail under the new provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes do not challenge the fact that the affected worker is injured&mdash;they do not change that one bit&mdash;but merely whether the worker is entitled to be paid compensation for the injury. This change will not isolate a few malingerers who may be ripping off the system. These measures do not even seek to distinguish with regard to the extent or genuineness of the injury. They merely establish grounds for lawyers to argue against Commonwealth liability for the consequences of the injury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that these changes bring the legislation into line with the original intention of the scheme. I find that, I have to say, a very unconvincing argument. In originally introducing a requirement for a material contribution&mdash;the current standard&mdash;the mischief that the parliament sought to overcome was that liability under the then existing legislation was established for injury with little if any connection with employment. To overcome this, the legislation required that, rather than the employment merely being a contributing factor to the injury, the connection had to be sufficiently material that it could be said the injury was caused by the employment. In other words, the legislation was not seeking to limit liability only to those circumstances where the contribution of employment to injury was significant or substantial but rather was ensuring that any connection was real as opposed to simply incidental. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6382">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's justification for this change is grossly overstated. It seems to me this change is simply about reducing the number of claims so as to deliver savings to the budget. It appears to be irrelevant to the government that some of the rejected claims will undoubtedly be legitimate and that, as we will see later, the current financial status of the scheme does not justify the change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second change the bill makes to the circumstances in which compensation can be claimed is even more alarming. I believe this change attacks the very nature of Australia's workers compensation schemes as no&hyphen;fault compensation schemes. This change provides that compensation will not be payable in respect of an injury that arises solely or predominantly out of reasonable managerial or administrative action taken in a reasonable manner by the employer in connection with the employee's employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, this exclusion has been drawn too wide. In effect, it will deny compensation to all workers suffering from a stress related disease, or any other mental injury, other than where the employer has acted negligently or unreasonably. This is tantamount to replacing the no&hyphen;fault scheme with a scheme based on fault by the employer. We are almost getting back to a negligence based scheme, from which we have been trying to get away for generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his second reading speech the minister was at pains to avoid the perception that the new exclusion was as wide as I have stated, but the terms of the bill do not match his rhetoric. I understand the impression he is trying to give, and he goes on television doing his Mr Reasonable impersonation, but the fact of the matter is that the courts will be interpreting the words of the law passed by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister stated that the exclusion does not embrace every kind of instruction or action by the employer and generally will not cover a direction or series of instructions concerning the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day task which an employee performs. But this is not reflected in the terms of the legislation. The legislation is drafted widely. It refers simply and only to reasonable managerial or administrative 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> action. This term is defined to include employer actions such as disciplining an employee, not promoting an employee or not providing a benefit. This definition is expressly inclusive, and so leaves open the prospect of other employer actions, such as instructions concerning day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day tasks, falling within the exception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also stated that the amendments are primarily aimed at stress or stress related injuries. That might be his aim, it might be the people at whom he is aiming, but they are not the only people who are going to be hit by this measure. It is true that physical injury is expressly exempted from the exclusion&mdash;and that is obviously appropriate&mdash;but mental injury is not. This clearly means that not only stress claims but all other claims for mental injury can be caught by the exclusion. This is becoming an increasingly important area of proper social concern and a matter about which the government should be taking positive action rather than seeking to punish those who may have the misfortune to suffer such an injury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A simple example can vividly illustrate the width of the new exclusion introduced by this bill. Take the case of an employer who requests an employee, as part of his or her normal duties, to take some money for deposit to the bank. The employee is robbed at gunpoint on the way to the bank and suffers permanent agoraphobia as a result. There is a strong argument that the employee could not, under these new provisions, claim compensation. We will not know how it will be interpreted by the courts, but it is certainly arguable and open to that argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if it is not the government's current intention that that should be the case&mdash;and let me, for the purposes of this debate, accept that; I do not know what is in the mind of the minister but let me accept that he does not wish that to be the case&mdash;it would certainly be open to a lawyer on behalf of the Commonwealth as employer to mount such an argument, and they would have a reasonable prospect of success. Agoraphobia would be a mental injury within the meaning of the provisions and could therefore fall within the new exclusion. It could be affected by this, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6383"> unquestionably. The agoraphobia would have arisen solely or predominantly out of reasonable managerial action, a direction to the employee concerning his or her day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day tasks, and could also fall within such a claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not seeking to establish that there is some fiendish plot by the minister consciously setting out to exclude these and, of course, many other circumstances within the continuum between the very simple cases that the minister has been alluding to in his Mr Reasonable impersonations on television and the case which I have outlined. There is a long continuum, and we do not know where the line is going to be drawn on that continuum, but all mental injury is included and the inclusive nature of the examples in the legislation does not give one any confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hard to imagine that anybody would deny that an employee in the circumstances I have outlined should not be entitled to workers compensation. In my view, it would be an obscene outcome if that were the result. Yet that obscene outcome is made possible by these new provisions. The heart of the problem with the new provisions is therefore that, because they are so wide, they are likely to exclude large numbers of legitimate claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This can be seen when regard is had to a 1993-94 survey by Comcare of the causes of stress claims, if we refer only to those. My concern is that we are casting the net wider than stress, but let us just stick to those. The 1993-94 Comcare survey said the causes were 24 per cent interpersonal conflict, 24 per cent workload and deadlines, 22 per cent organisational change, 17 per cent physical and verbal abuse, 7 per cent performance counselling and other management processes, and 6 per cent per forced relocation and organisational restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new exclusion would appear certainly to exclude stress claims caused by performance counselling and other management processes and forced relocation and organisational restructuring&mdash;that is, 13 per cent of claims. It could exclude claims caused by workload and deadlines, which is certainly where a lot of the increasing pressure in the public sector is being felt, and organisational change, which would mean a further 46 per 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cent of the claims. On the basis of this survey, the proposed changes could exclude up to 59 per cent of stress claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed changes also suffer from significant problems beyond the exclusion of legitimate claims. That is my primary concern; I make no secret about it. We should not be making these alterations if we accept and recognise that people can be injured in the course of their work&mdash;not malingering&mdash;and get no access to the workers compensation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over and above that, the central reliance of this exclusion on the reasonableness ground will have all the shortcomings of common law processes that the statutory workers compensation scheme sought to avoid. It is capricious. Workers who suffer injury where the effects of their work conditions were not clearly understood at the time are likely not to be compensated because the absence of knowledge would tend to show management action at the time was reasonable&mdash;reasonable in the light of the current knowledge when the manager made the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, rather than promoting a culture of cure or prevention, the new provisions promote a culture of excuse. The provision of an exclusion of liability on the basis of reasonableness may cause management to focus on being able to justify any subsequent injury as having been the result of reasonable action, rather than attempting to avoid the injury in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the vague and subjective notion of reasonableness will only lead to an explosion of litigation as employers and employees attempt to define the undefinable. These features alone make the new exclusion unacceptable but when coupled with the fact that the new provisions are likely to exclude large numbers of legitimate claims for compensation and do so by fundamentally undermining the no-fault basis of the scheme, the provisions deserve to be resoundingly rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our arguments against these changes to the circumstance in which compensation is payable under the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme do not end there. The justification the minister has put forward for the changes&mdash;that the cost attached to stress 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6384"> claims has grave implications for the future sustainability of the scheme&mdash;does not seem to have any validity. Certainly the present financial position of the scheme does not warrant changes that are as draconian as these.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is made abundantly clear in the most recent report on the performance of Comcare. That report into the administration of the Commonwealth's workers compensation scheme appears to indicate that the incidence and duration of claims, including for stress, does not threaten to undermine the continuing viability and efficiency of the scheme. The scheme continues to be in surplus, reserves are increasing, liabilities are declining, administrative costs are reducing, program costs are stable, premium rates are decreasing and claims frequency is declining. It is hard to imagine a report that is further from indicating an impending crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody can deny that there must be continuing vigilance to ensure the viability and efficiency of the scheme. That is an obligation we all have in the parliament to the taxpayers. But given the existing healthy state of the scheme, this objective does not seem in any way to necessitate the extent of the changes the government wants to introduce through this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that the changes the government is proposing to the circumstances in which compensation is payable in relation to stress and other mental injuries are no more than a transparent attempt to make savings at the expense of injured workers. Suggestions by the minister that the changes are necessitated not by an attempt to generate savings but rather an attempt to establish&mdash;this is one of the great phrases&mdash;`management-employee relations on a sounder footing' are just arrant nonsense. In what possible manner can we suggest that these changes are going to improve the basis of management&hyphen;employee relations in the public sector?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might say this is a way to catch malingerers. In my view we should be catching malingerers, but I do not believe this will help in any way. That is a proper thing for us all to do, but this does not contribute to it. It does not distinguish in any way between 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legitimate and illegitimate claims. It is impossible to imagine how it will establish management-employee relations on a sounder footing. It will only cause more dispute, more contention, more litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I should refer briefly to the other provisions in this bill that relate to changes to the administration of the scheme. With one exception, the opposition will be supporting these amendments. The exception is, however, an important one. The bill proposes to make Comcare, rather than the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission, responsible for determining contributions by departments and authorities to the administrative costs of the scheme. This could leave the commission, which continues to have an important role in overseeing the scheme, in implementing occupational health and safety programs, and in supervising some of Comcare's activities, without the capacity to determine the funds available to it for these purposes. Those funds will be determined by Comcare&mdash;the body that the commission is designed to supervise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Careful examination reveals that this is an extraordinary outcome. An independent tripartite statutory body with a regulatory role, the commission, will have its funding determined by the bureaucratic body which it regulates, Comcare. We cannot and do not support this proposal. We do not regard it as simply a matter of administration; it is a change in policy which we cannot accept. Therefore, in the consideration in detail stage of this bill we will move an amendment to give the commission the power to issue guidelines to Comcare relating to Comcare's powers to determine the amount of contributions and the basis upon which they will be levied. To avoid any doubt, this amendment proposes that Comcare be explicitly directed to comply with any such guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Workers compensation has been a fundamental element of the security of Australian working families for a very long time. That security from financial distress at a time of physical or mental injury is not something to be played with or put at risk lightly. Certain conservative politicians and commentators have sought to portray stress related disease as a rort, but stress is an increasing problem, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6385"> not just in the Public Service but throughout Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1988 the then Labor government introduced a new scheme of workers compensation for Commonwealth employees. It is this government's view that those changes have, in general, been positive. However, in his second reading speech, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reviewing performance to date, it is clear that the adoption of a more focused approach to prevention, rehabilitation and claims management has reduced the personal and economic costs of injury and disease in Commonwealth  employment for a number of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is all very positive, but there are a few holes in the scheme and the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill acts to tidy up some language and provisions and to address a couple of major anomalies. The Commonwealth's liabilities at 30 June, 1995 totalled $1.5 billion. Despite a decrease in the number of claims, there was an increase in both the complexity and duration of claims, which led to higher program costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those reforms in 1988 were really intended to address the problem that existed where, for a disease to be compensable, employment must have contributed to a material degree to the contraction of the disease. A number of problems have arisen as a result of that definition, not the least of those being re Miers and Commonwealth of Australia v. Comcare, where the Administrative Appeals 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Tribunal ruled that `material' meant `pertinent or likely to influence'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this bill the government is attempting to go back and apply words that meet the intent of the original act in 1988. That is that, for a disease to be compensable, employment must be a significant or substantial cause of the disease. That is what this issue is all about. This new legislation also has an exclusion provision which provides that compensation is not payable in respect of an injury which arises from reasonable disciplinary action taken against an employee or from a failure by the employee to obtain a promotion, transfer or benefit in connection with the employment. The Commonwealth, as has been stated by the minister and by the shadow minister, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), believes that stress claims are being used in a number of cases to register complaints against or frustrate the taking of reasonable employment related actions and some of those stress claims are totally inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The creation of a culture of care in the workplace will not work if we do not make this issue of stress a mainstream issue. The member for Canberra said, `Some workers will be worse off, but none will be better off.' That is the ALP and union approach to workers compensation every time we discuss these issues&mdash;on every issue and at every venue. I recall back in the 1980s, when the then Cain Labor government in Victoria wanted to completely change a decrepit, ineffective and very expensive workers compensation system, the Trades Hall Council had so much influence over Barney Cooney's attempt to create a fair, equitable system that the whole thing blew apart. It took until 1992 for the Kennett government to come in and perform major surgery on that legislation in order to make it work properly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It took the Kennett government to revamp totally that legislation&mdash;to get rid of all the rorts. The member for Canberra asks how you can have better workplace relations by tightening up workers compensation access. I will tell you how. If one worker sees that his colleagues are able to rort the system, go off on leave forever and continue to get paid 100 per cent of their wages or very close thereto, what incentive is there for the person who is still at work to do his job safely and properly? There is absolutely none. These rortable systems are absolutely deplorable. They do absolutely nothing to further the cause of good management&hyphen;worker relations or to promote the cause of occupational health and safety, which is an important issue for all of us, I might add.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Canberra also went on in his contribution and attacked the minister for some supposed inconsistency by saying that the government's intention in this legislation was not to attract budget savings. The member for Canberra said that was wrong&mdash;that there were going to be budget savings. I am advised that the savings attributed to the government's amendments are not savings which are reflected in the budget&mdash;that is, they do not flow to consolidated revenue and they do not contribute directly to improvement in the budget bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, the savings are aggregated savings to the budgets of the particular agencies covered by the act and are used for other purposes relevant to the agencies' functions. There is no point to the opposition arguing that the amendments before the House are budget savings driven initiatives in any pure sense&mdash;they are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister is well aware that in his attack on this issue he is arguing that agencies must pay higher premiums than they reasonably should. I would think that is a very strange proposition for the member for Canberra to be running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Occupational stress claims are generally very high cost claims. The number of accepted claims is dropping, but the cost associated 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with those claims remains very high. The annual cost of stress claims has risen from $24 million in 1991&hyphen;92 to an estimated $35.7 million for the 1996-97 financial year. To date in 1996&hyphen;97, stress claims represent five per cent of accepted claims but account for 18 per cent of costs. The average cost of a stress claim is $32,700, compared with $7,700 for other claims. In other words, stress claims cost the taxpayer more than four times as much as other types of claims. Stress claims are also of longer duration. After 12 months, 15 per cent of those with stress claims are still off work, compared with four per cent of employees with other claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you a couple of examples of cases where an employee has received compensation for stress in response to what can only be described as legitimate management action. It is these types of claims which the reasonable management provisions in the bill are designed to exclude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An employee was interviewed in relation to possible criminal offences but, before any action was taken, he lodged a claim for stress and he received compensation. An employee had a fear of being made redundant. She claimed stress, added to by a clash of personality with a supervisor. She was off work for several months on compensation. An employee applied for promotion but was not successful. In line with department practice, she was counselled as to the reasons why she missed out on the job. She left work and subsequently claimed compensation for stress on the grounds the counselling upset her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have come to the conclusion that this business of occupational health and safety is all about culture. Until we convince managements that they have an absolute responsibility to provide a safe working environment for everyone who works in the workplace, and until we convince the people who work in the workplace that each of them has an individual and collective responsibility to help maintain that safe environment and to help themselves and their colleagues remain injury and disease free, then we will continue to fail. It is not really all that very complicated. Remember, sometimes it is as simple as not forgetting to close the bottom drawer of a four&hyphen;drawer 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6387"> filing cabinet so your colleague does not fall over it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make the general comment that the Commonwealth considers workplace safety matters to be important. I want to make it clear that the Commonwealth government is fully committed to helping improve the current record. I would like to focus on the Commonwealth's view on the need for improved outcomes in drawing on the findings of the Industry Commission and the small business deregulation task force report. The message that ministers are receiving concerns the consequences of a lack of national consistency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could ask why it is necessary for governments and the community to address this issue of workplace health and safety. The Industry Commission's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Work, Health and Safety</EMPHASIS> provides a graphic summary of the scale of the problem in Australia. Each year 2,200 people die from workplace related diseases. Each year 160,000 workers are compensated for work related injury or illness requiring at least five days off work. Each year an estimated 650,000 people are injured or become ill as a result of their work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission report puts the costs in the range of $20 billion annually. That is the problem as we know it. The question is how do we find ways to reduce the human and economic costs associated with injury and disease at work. The Industry Commission acknowledged that there is no single panacea, no quick fix to the problem, and concluded that the whole community&mdash;employers, employees, their associations and trade unions as well as governments&mdash;can play an important role in improving occupational health and safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How then can the regulators play their role? From the Commonwealth perspective, the answer lies in setting a framework that allows national standards to be applied in the states and territories in a way that is readily understood, applicable and results oriented. It would be fair to say that one of the major findings of the Industry Commission report related to the different obligations on employers and employees and the different level of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> protection existing for employees doing the same work in various jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Exposure limits for some hazards and rules for hazardous plant and equipment vary across all the jurisdictions. These differences have major cost implications for employers operating in more than one state or more than one jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent report of the government's small business deregulation task force, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for business</EMPHASIS>, also identified the lack of national consistency in OH&amp;S as a major area for concern by small business. I will return to this report briefly. In respect of the existing regulatory framework, the Industry Commission recommended that a three&hyphen;tier regulatory structure be implemented and based on the premise of encouraging those in the workplace to take greater responsibility for the management of risks to health and to safety. Such an approach constitutes a move from direct imposition of the workplace solutions to providing an informed choice by those at work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This approach is consistent with a demonstrated need to reform workplaces by providing a greater choice in the organisation and manner in which work is performed in line with the provisions and the government's new Workplace Relations Act. The consequence of detailed regulatory OH&amp;S standards is that workplaces are unable to easily understand them, nevertheless implement them. This is particularly so in respect of small businesses that do not have the necessary expertise or time to come to grips with some of the myriad of requirements. What is needed is practical material to assist workplaces to identify and prevent workplace injury and diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While nationally agreed standards that the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission have developed have been adopted at jurisdictional level, implementation of the standards has been inconsistent across jurisdictions. This raises questions about the applicability and responsiveness of nationally consistent efforts to meet industry needs, particularly small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission found, firstly, that jurisdictions have legislated national 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6388"> standards in various ways with different effect; secondly, that the content of the standards implemented can differ to a significant degree from those declared by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission; and, thirdly, that not one of the priority standards has been fully implemented across the country. The law relating to occupational health and safety has dual objectives. Firstly, it seeks to prevent industrial injury or disease and, secondly, it aims to compensate persons who suffer industrial injuries or contract an industrial disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, the following example of rollover protective structures on tractors was relayed to me. The various plant safety regulations released by the states are all similar but contain variations in detail, and it is these variations that manufacturers and farm machinery dealers must understand at the point of product transfer. So far, the Tractor and Machinery Association of Australia has examined four different state regulations in detail. Differences exist between the states in relation to mandatory regulations applying to the minimum and maximum weight and age of tractors. In Victoria, the supplier, the employer or the self-employed user&mdash;the subcontractor&mdash;is required to ensure that a ROPS is fitted, whereas in other states the requirement is only on the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">States without mandatory requirements place the onus of decision upon the end user. However, depending on the circumstances known at the time of the sale, the manufacturer or the supplier might also logically be implicated. A preliminary look at a fifth set of draft PRATT regulations appears to present yet another set of variables. So, despite the agreement on a national standard, there are no common requirements at a state level on the starting date of the regulations or the minimum or maximum tractor weight for ROPS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is but one example, but it identifies a source of infinite frustration for the agricultural machinery and manufacturing industry that is now forced to devote more resources to try to understand the many regulations and codes of practice relevant to its industry. I am sure all of us are well aware of the inherent dan 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gers of tractors and how important it is that we help farmers to get it right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned earlier, the recent report by the small business deregulation task force identified problems with existing occupational health and safety arrangements. Business, especially small business, tells us there is still a need for a different approach to ensure improved OH&amp;S outcomes. Criticism was levelled at the many layers involved and the complexity and cost associated with OH&amp;S legislation. In terms of OH&amp;S requirements, it tells us it wants assistance which is practical and which is easily applicable to the workplaces rather than overtly proscriptive and technically focused, as it has generally tended to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The task force found that small businesses are concerned that they do not have the expertise to deal with technically complex OH&amp;S regulations. The findings of the task force are largely consistent with those of the Industry Commission as they related to unclear rights and duties, too much legislation, inflexible regulation, inconsistency between jurisdictions, inefficient mandated standards and inadequate and unhelpful codes of practice. The task force drew attention to surveys undertaken by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the South Australian government which, in its view, confirmed that most small businesses have difficulty understanding OH&amp;S requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a recent meeting, Labor ministers from all jurisdictions agreed to take a more direct leadership role complementing the work already undertaken by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. It is a shame that the member for Canberra had to blot his copybook by bringing in a spurious amendment to this very sensible piece of legislation designed to help make occupational health and safety a more proactive area for Commonwealth employees both at a management and at a workplace level. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for industrial relations, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), and to oppose the government's legislation. I have some concern that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6389"> changes that are being proposed in this legislation are designed to reduce the basic safety net entitlements of working people&mdash;that is, workers compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming as I do into this House with a trade union background, I have some passion on this issue. As the shadow minister said, workers compensation is the fundamental security for Australian working families. Of all the benefits that the trade union movement has won for working people in this country over a long period, there is certainly none more important than workers compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should mention in opening my remarks that one must doubt the strength of the government's case when a dorothy dixer was asked in question time on Monday by the member for O'Connor in which he was critical of public servants. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), in answering the question, quoted three cases and it would appear that workers had received a fairly large settlement. But we received very little detail of those cases, and it would hardly be seen as a cross-section of the number of stress claims in the Public Service. Nor did the minister quote the many genuine cases where stress leads to workers compensation claims and people being off work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) in his contribution raised the fact that stress related claims were a high cost factor and that they were longer in duration than other workers compensation claims. I do not think that either of those two arguments are relevant in this case. It only indicates the seriousness of stress claims. Certainly, the duration of stress claims are based on a medical decision; it is the medical profession that would make a decision as to how long people need to be off work to recuperate as a result of stress claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 introduces two amendments to the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, as announced in the 1996 budget, which concern the circumstances in which compensation is payable under the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme. Firstly, under the amendments, a disease&mdash;including a stress related disease&mdash;is compensable only 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> if the person's employment contributes to a disease to a significant degree&mdash;this is substantially higher than the existing material degree. Secondly, an injury, including a disease, is not compensable if the injury arises from reasonable managerial or administrative action taken in a reasonable manner by the employer. This includes reasonable disciplinary action against the employee and actions, based on reasonable grounds, not to promote, transfer or provide a benefit to the employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government has already telegraphed its intention to reduce benefits applying to workers under this legislation. In an announcement relating to the forward estimates for the 1996 budget, the government said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will amend the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to facilitate the management of stress claims consistent with the intention of the act. It is expected that this will reduce the cost of compensation claims&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and also, I might add, workers entitlements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">over the forward years and consequently also reduce premiums for agencies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Local and overseas experience shows that occupational stress is a worldwide phenomenon, particularly with governments and industry striving for better bottom line results. Downsizing has seen many loyal workers being either retrenched or offered alternative employment, resulting in workers, through no fault of their own, being subject to enormous stress through management or political decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recently concluded survey of 1,000 employees at the tax office has revealed that stress remains one of the greatest problems facing the Public Service. Conducted by the Community and Public Sector Union, the survey showed that one-third of respondents had taken leave from work over the previous 12 months due to workplace stress. It revealed that the vast majority of these absences were taken as sick leave or recreational leave, with only five per cent taken as compensation leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These findings support the result of a recent investigation into stress amongst staff of the Department of Social Security in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales. The study 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6390"> found that 39 per cent of staff had taken some form of leave over the previous 12 months as a result of workplace stress, but only seven per cent actually lodged a compensation claim for stress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should have the good grace to acknowledge this. But they would rather have us believe that workers are rorting compensation all over Australia, hence this bill. In fact, workers are very honourably using their valuable recreation and sick leave entitlements to cover what should really be recognised as compensation matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Workers in Australia have always been renowned for this type of responsible approach, but it has not always been recognised by governments or employers. It is like the alleged overtime bill that employers complain about. If employees charged private and government employers for all the unpaid overtime they worked, wage bills would be a lot higher. But let us not be too generous in our praise for workers&mdash;it is not always acceptable in this day and age, particularly by the coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Stress can clearly affect long-term employees who, through their personal efforts, skill and loyalty, have contributed to the success of the organisations they work for. They therefore establish in their own minds a feeling of satisfaction with their contribution to the organisation they work for. It encourages them to have high morale and a desire to work and therefore increases productivity. I would argue that stress that arises from any political or managerial decision which unfairly destroys this feeling of satisfaction should be compensable&mdash;the same as any other work related injury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst stress continues to be a major problem for workers generally, it should be noted that the most recent figures of duration show a decline in both actual levels of stress claimed and the average duration of stress compared to other claims. This view is supported by figures contained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Comcare Australia Annual Report 1995-96</EMPHASIS>, which shows that in 1994-95 stress claims, as a percentage of all claims accepted by Comcare, accounted for 9.6 per cent. In 1995-96, this figure had dropped to 6.9 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of this reduction can be attributed to the efforts that the union movement, the SRC Commission and Comcare have taken in relation to preventative activities. The CPSU has entered into arrangements and honoured them during the last EFA negotiations to alleviate problems associated with stress. The amendments introduced by the government run counter to the spirit of this enterprise agreement in which the parties have agreed that they would work to reduce the number of stress related claims without the need for legislative change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the SRC Commission has undertaken a number of initiatives that seek to address these issues. In 1995, the stress management centre was established to provide a holistic approach to incorporating preventative strategies and improving administrative arrangements. Over the past 12 months the SRC Commission has been committed to the development of a preventative program to deal specifically with stress. This has again been supported by the CPSU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would appear that the act already provides a balance between the interests of the Commonwealth as an employer and its employees in that stress relating to, one, injury or aggravation suffered by an employee as a result of reasonable disciplinary action, or, two, failure of the employee to obtain promotion, transfer or benefit in connection with his or her employment is not compensable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To use a current example, senior members of the New South Wales Police Force have been retrenched. Their employment was terminated, in the words of the new commissioner, to establish a new management structure, not because these particular people were in any way corrupt or inefficient; there simply was, in the view of one person&mdash;the new commissioner&mdash;no longer any room at the top for these people. If these people had been Commonwealth public servants and suffered a stress related injury because of this type of managerial decision they would have qualified for compensation. Under the government's proposed amendments, these people would have a very difficult legal battle to establish their rights for compensation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6391">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By a simple change of words from `material degree' to `significant degree', the government has significantly added to the stress of its employees because the terminology adds a clear strengthening to the language of the bill. Any examination of the words in a dictionary will show that just by these two small changes the job has been made much harder for your employees&mdash;and here I refer to the government&mdash;to achieve compensation. I repeat the term `your employees' because it seems to me that government members sometimes think public servants are somebody else's employees, that they have no responsibility for any pain they choose to inflict upon them by political decisions&mdash;they are not someone else's employees, they are yours. It is your employees to whom you are adding these pressures&mdash;pressures that are simply placed on top of those already created in the last few years as we have insisted that the public service become leaner and meaner and that there be fewer and fewer staff to handle more and more work as determined by their political masters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Elizabeth McDowall, the manager of policy in the Victorian Workcover Authority has stated that occupational stress is associated with organisational change, downsizing, redeployment and redundancy in an environment where the workplace is continuously pushed to increase productivity, reduce cost and produce more with less. This very clearly applies to the Commonwealth Public Service where, once again, under this government, there have been massive retrenchments in a whole range of public service departments. This simply means that fewer and fewer people have to do more and more work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To return to specifics, the strength of the current legislation in providing a balance between employee and employer rights is spelled out in a letter from Comcare to the ACTU dated 7 February 1996. The letter indicates that it is the SCMC that will not just accept the diagnosis of work related stress; there must be a diagnosable condition. Where the medical information on a claim is unclear, the SCMC may investigate a claim through the use of a psychiatrist to determine whether a claimant suffers from a diagnosable medical 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> condition or whether the claimant is merely unhappy or dissatisfied with the result of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the minister has suggested in his statement that workers compensation has been awarded to workers for stress related conditions that have arisen as a result of counselling, poor work performance, a failure to get a promotion or other actions taken by management. This is a clear signal that the coalition government is intending to provide an exclusion from liability in relation to injury or disease which takes place as a result of reasonable management action. This further erodes the protection that this act presently provides for injured workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of the government's amendments is to deny compensation entitlements to all workers suffering stress related diseases in circumstances other than where the employer has acted negligently or unreasonably&mdash;but to be determined by whom? The reasonableness test will have all the shortcomings of a common law process that statutory workers compensation schemes attempt to avoid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, these amendments will only lead to an explosion of litigation as employers and employees attempt to define the indefinable. This is another stark example of the government's archaic view that the old master-servant relationship should be reinforced and that workers rights are simply an unnecessary impediment to achieving a good profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1983, Bob Hawke was elected. He promised to and succeeded in healing divisions in Australia. The present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is, in fact, giving all his ministers encouragement never to leave their comfortable time warp of the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. It is as if none of these excellent changes had ever been introduced in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill encapsulates all of these outdated views and inflicts upon workers just one more problem to cope with. When they are retrenched or take voluntary packages, workers' stress will reach even higher levels as they find they also have to use up all of their package and their super before they can achieve any other government assistance. This 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6392"> bill underscores the absolutely appalling approach that this government is taking towards ordinary workers in this nation while carrying on in their public utterances about the concerns for Mr and Mrs Ordinary Australia. When the curtain of deceit is finally lifted and ordinary Australians are exposed to the government's anti&hyphen;worker policies, there will be a vigorous and unmistakable voter backlash against this coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In finalising my submission, once again I want to strongly reinforce the fact that workers compensation is the major benefit protecting Australian workers and we should not forget that we are not simply talking about those people who are working for the government; we are talking about their families. This coalition government tells us they are interested in families but it would appear to me that this is not the case, particularly when they are prepared to introduce legislation of this nature. People do not need additional stress at this time when many people out there, particularly public servants, are worried about their jobs&mdash;whether they are going to be retained or retrenched. We on this side of the House very strongly oppose the government's moves under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the amendment fails to recognise is the changing nature of work over the past 20 to 30 years when, I am sure, injuries caused by physical factors have reduced considerably due to occupational health and safety regulations and the awareness of employees and employers of the need to observe tight safety regulations at the work site. There is no doubt in my mind that in many areas of workers compensation there would have been a dramatic reduction in claims and in costs, particularly where physical factors come into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, we could all agree that there is an equal possibility that, due to organisational change&mdash;as highlighted by Elizabeth McDowall and others&mdash;in an environment of continuous change workplace stress will increase. There is no doubt that the Australian Public Service at the moment is going through continuous change which is going to create many stressful situations. This being the case, I believe there is a strong 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> argument to strengthen legislation such as the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and not weaken it as this government amendment surely does. I support the amendment moved by the shadow minister.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The propositions that are raised by these amendments in effect ensure that those people who have a genuine claim surely must be admitted and, in a limited set of circumstances, do get their rights before the tribunal concerned with determining the facts in issue. At the same time the amendments weed out a lot of the rorting that has clearly gone on in relation to this particular area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take a fairly rigid view in relation to matters of stress, I confess. This is a personal view. In fact, in the many cases involving personal injury where I have had to appear for plaintiffs, it was always my practice to minimise any emphasis on the stress element of their claim. It was common then, and I think it still is, that the common law courts give very little weight to these sorts of claims, whereas they are very interested in claims that relate to physical injury which leads to real assessed disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I generally take the view&mdash;it is a view perhaps shared by a lot of my friends in small business&mdash;that stress is what you make it. There are many people in small business today who are suffering from the most unbelievable stresses caused by the time they have to put into running a business, the time they have to spend away from their families and the hours they have to put in to compete with big chain stores. It is virtually a seven day a week, 12 hour a day job, particularly in retail. Yet they go on and the reason they go on is that there is no backup. They cannot take time off because the moment they leave that business there is nothing coming in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have asked many people, `If there were no backup, would you make a claim? Would you be away from work if there were no compensation for it?' The answer is universally, `I would be at work.' That, in my view, assists in putting the whole thing into context. I do not, for one moment, deny what the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) says about the importance of workers com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6393"> pensation in relation to the relationships that have existed for many years between employers and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very important system. It was very important to ensure that workers who were injured in the course of their employment, both in relation to negligence by their employer or by other employees or, alternatively, their own negligence, in the case of the compensation system, should be paid. It has been said in many cases that frequently, in relation to common law claims in any event, employees are injured when they are getting on with their employer's business. In those particular cases, I have great sympathy for an employee who has been injured and I would apply a very, very narrow test of negligence at common law in those sorts of circumstances. I would take a very liberal view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course the other side of the coin is that there are people who are deliberately rorting the system, who are deliberately taking every conceivable advantage to bleed the system. Those cases, which I will refer to shortly, have already been mentioned by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). It is those cases that undermine the whole fabric of the system. It is often forgotten by members of the opposition that we are talking about people who are in employment. There are a lot of people out there who are not in employment because we are spending millions and millions of dollars propping up a system for those who should be working but who are abusing the system. Those people I have absolutely no sympathy with at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe&mdash;it has happened in Queensland in recent years&mdash;that the law is becoming much more stringent when it comes to bogus claims. We are regularly seeing the rorters caught out bending their backs digging the garden or putting up brick walls or lifting engines out of cars. They are being caught with spy cameras while they are suffering from debilitating so-called back illnesses. We have seen a lot of examples of that. It is very important in this process, in my view, to ensure that not only do we tighten up the legislation itself, but also we keep a watchful eye over those suspect claims which may well 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be in need of being examined at closer quarters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original intent of the act itself has, in my view, been distorted by decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court. The case of Re Miers and the Commonwealth, which is one case that is relevant in this particular situation, involved the determination by the tribunal of `in a material degree'. What does `in a material degree' mean? In that case, it was held to mean:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It need be no more than "pertinent or likely to influence."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Quoting a decision of Mr Justice Davies in Australian Telecommunications Commission and Treloar:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contributing factor need do no more than contribute in a material way. The factor is not required to be the real, proximate or effective cause of the disease or of its development. When several . . . factors together cause the contraction of a disease or its acceleration, aggravation or recurrence, all that is required is that one such factor exhibits the necessary connection with the worker's employment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I found that an extremely liberal interpretation of `material' and thought I would have a little look at how the dictionary has defined it. I looked first at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shorter Oxford</EMPHASIS> . In relation to the legal element of `material', it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of evidence or a fact; significant, influential, esp. to the extent of determining a cause, affecting a judgment . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is certainly a different definition from what has been relied upon by the tribunal in question following the decision of Mr Justice Davies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, in relation to the meaning of `material', the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Butterworths Australian Legal Dictionary</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Important, essential or relevant. In contract law . . . a misrepresentation may also be material where a representee who has already decided to enter into the contract is influenced not to change his or her mind.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of a material fact in terms of a statement of claim, the same dictionary states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A relevant fact. A statement of claim must contain the material facts on which the claim is based in order to show that there is a reasonable cause of action.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6394">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macquarie Dictionary</EMPHASIS>  states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . likely to influence the determination of a cause&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which is similar to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shorter Oxford</EMPHASIS> . Those definitions are certainly much tighter and much more, I would have thought, in the draftsman's mind when the original legislation was passed than what the court decided it really meant. In fact, the court diluted the meaning of `material' so that it was negligible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, I think it is fair to say that, really, if you had a negligible association, that was sufficient. I think that that was really spawned out of the long-established principle that in workers compensation matters the courts should adopt a fairly liberal construction of legislation. That was a good principle in the days when workers compensation was treated as almost a handout mentality by those in government and employers. It was always felt that people should go to work whether they were three&hyphen;quarters dead or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall that, in 1955, we were involved in a very serious road accident. My father was working on the wharves at the time. He went to work the next day on crutches. This was not a work related accident, of course. He had a broken foot. That was the approach to work in those days. The fact of the matter was that, if he had not gone to work, he would not have been able to provide for his family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the approach to work now has swung the other way to such an extent that there are people&mdash;and the cases are there&mdash;working the system to the detriment of decent working people. Remember this, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a diminution in morale in the workplace as a result of this going on and people being seen to get away with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the cases mentioned by the minister bear repeating. One particular case the minister mentioned was that of an employee who claimed stress as a result of a grievance process. A colleague had lodged a grievance against the employee and the investigating officer found that the employee had acted improperly. The employee was not happy about the result and had not been at work since mid&hyphen;1995.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second claim, which is almost too bizarre to be believable, related to a situation where certain members of the Public Service were moving offices. They were in temporary accommodation. An employee claimed stress as a result of what she perceived to be an inappropriate comment in the workplace. The comment was made to the whole group, but she found it offensive. The words were to the effect that, whilst it was inconvenient for people to be moved from permanent accommodation to temporary accommodation, given the circumstances, people would simply have to go through the exercise and wait and see. But here is the twist in the tail: the individual lodged her claim only when her own poor performance was called into question. The cost of that claim is in the region of $190,000. That really is quite outrageous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another case that was mentioned involved an employee who had an affair at work. When the affair ended, she felt unable to remain in the workplace and lodged a claim for stress. The cost to the Commonwealth, the cost to the taxpayer, is $80,000 to date. It is just not acceptable. Someone should try to sell that to ordinary, average, hardworking Australian workers and see how much truck they get with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another case, an employee was requested to attend a counselling session to discuss his work performance. He went on sick leave and lodged a claim for stress. That employee has been absent from work since mid&hyphen;1995. Another claim I was going to mention involved an employee who claimed work related stress due to disputes with his employer. The cost to the Commonwealth of that was about $192,000. On it goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot&mdash;and I do not think my friends opposite are suggesting this&mdash;keep a situation like that running, because it is not fair on the other members of the work force. It is not fair on those unemployed people who are desperately looking for work and cannot find it. The limited expenditures are being wasted and diluted by people who are deliberately rorting the system, and there is no other word for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at the statistics for work related stress. Twenty&hyphen;five per cent 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6395"> related to pressure from workload and deadlines; 25 per cent related to workplace trauma, client aggression and assault; 18 per cent related to interpersonal conflict; seven per cent related to witnessing physical or verbal abuse; six per cent related to forced relocation and organisational restructuring; four per cent related to performance counselling and other management processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want it to be thought for one minute that I am suggesting that the workers compensation system is failing us as a result of these claims. These claims have gone on and the process is designed to stop these claims from continuing. The workers compensation system is an important system and I am a strong supporter of the common law system remaining. Indeed, I do have some disagreements with my party about this particular matter.</PARA>

There are genuine cases where they exhaust litigants getting to the door of the court so that the litigants are so stressed out, apart from the injuries they are suffering, that they will accept anything to go away. There are cases of blatant negligence. I have seen litigants get dragged for 10 years through this process. They finally get to the door of the court, they are just about worn out and they are offered a pittance. They are minded to take the offer because of the way the board have dragged the process out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill that we are dealing with today relates primarily to, as the previous contributions have indicated, stress and stress related claims under the Comcare legislation. The essential purpose of the legislation is to replace the term `material degree' in the legislation with the term `significant degree', which relates to the degree of nexus that must exist between the injury or disease that is sustained by the applicant and the contribution that has been made to this injury or disease by work or work related activity. The term `significant degree' is defined as `substantially more than material', which is, I suppose, a slightly circular way of going about it but it makes the intention of the legislation very plain, which is to lift the barrier to claims, particularly stress claims, that are brought under this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note some of the history of this. I appreciate some of the comments, although I disagree with a number of them from the honourable member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith). This has been a longstanding matter of contention in workers compensation going back many years. In the late 1970s, the then Hamer government in Victoria sought to replace the term `material' with the term `significant' in the Victorian legislation. This led to major industrial disputation, particularly with groups of workers like firemen, I think police, teachers and others who had substantial concerns about issues associated with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6396"> workers compensation that ultimately led to the defeat of this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, there has been a great deal of concern within Comcare with respect to the increase in the cost burden of stress claims, and it is particularly associated with the length of time that people are off work. It would appear that that is the core element in the problem of a growing percentage of total Comcare outgoings that relate to stress claims. It is in fact primarily associated with the amount of time that people are absent from work. With respect to people who are covered by the Comcare scheme, the length of time people have off due to work related stress is substantially longer than the total average time taken off for injuries incurred at work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An associated amendment is very clearly also directed at stress claims and is designed to exclude injuries arising from reasonable managerial or administrative action, such as disciplinary action, decisions with respect to promotion and the like. On the face of it, it would seem that this is a reasonable proposition to advance, but the devil is in the detail, as is the case in so many other things. The real issue that the opposition has with respect to this particular amendment is the term `reasonable'. What constitutes reasonable managerial action will be inherently subjective and very difficult to measure and quantify. When we put that together with the issue of `substantially more than material', we have a recipe for enormous subjectivity, enormous bias and enormous variation across judicial decisions with respect to Comcare claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is essentially a rather crude and mechanistic way of tackling stress claims and the increasing burden that they are posing on the Comcare scheme. It is interesting to note that in the last year or so there has been a decline in the number of stress claims lodged per 100 Commonwealth employees. Although the burden that stress claims have imposed has increased significantly, it would appear that these claims are declining in number somewhat, which is at least of some value in this discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important also to recognise that the increase in the incidence of stress and the impact of stress in areas like the Common 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wealth Public Service is in some respects a broader symptom of social and economic change in our community and should not be seen purely in isolation. It is difficult in these cases to disentangle the different sources that ultimately lead to a person suffering a sufficient degree of stress or associated problems that render them unable to continue to work. Often it is a mixture of a variety of issues&mdash;some of them work related, some not work related.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any authority that is dealing with these issues always has to disentangle those and attribute a proportion of blame to the workplace. That will always be a problem, and the government is seeking to lift the bar to make it harder for an employee to get workers compensation with respect to the work related nature of their stress or illness. It will lead, in my view, to legitimate claims being rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although there was some balance in contribution of the honourable member for Dickson, I thought it was unfortunate that he read through a couple of very limited descriptions of a number of stress related claims. I doubt whether he knows the full detail of those cases, and I would caution him and other members about forming judgments about individual cases in this or other areas without knowing the full details. The coalition is fairly good at citing&mdash;we have seen this in the unfair dismissal area and the workers compensation area&mdash;one-liners that often give a totally distorted picture of what has gone on in a particular claim and using that as an example to suggest that the current framework is somehow ridiculous or unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know the individual circumstances that the honourable member has cited, but I certainly do not wish to draw any conclusions based on a one-line description without actually knowing the full details of the case. In this area it is very easy to caricature the circumstances, to caricature the individual claims and to put them up in lights and say, `Isn't this ridiculous?', without actually giving the people the full benefit of the detail and the full benefit of what has been involved in the decision&hyphen;making process and what factors determined the outcome in that process.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6397">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget that there is considerable stress in many parts of federal government service. I would think that it has improved somewhat, although with recent government cutbacks and massive retrenchments we are probably going back to the good old days of the Fraser government. I remind people, for example, of what it is like to work on a counter in Social Security, particularly during the time when I had a bit of experience of it under the Fraser government in the late 1970s. People would often be waiting for four hours to be told, `Sorry, the cheque's in the mail' or, `Sorry, we can't do anything for you.' The end result for Social Security staff, who are grossly underresourced and grossly understaffed, was that they would spend most of their day being screamed at and being threatened and abused, understandably, by distressed clients. It is hardly surprising that, in those sorts of circumstances, people are likely to develop serious stress conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not a uniform set of experiences in the Commonwealth Public Service but it is clearly a significant set of experiences. The sorts of cutbacks that this government is making will exacerbate the possibility of those things occurring to people. So do not for one minute think that everybody in the federal Public Service is just sitting there staring out of the window in some small office reading the paper. A lot of public servants are exposed in a front&hyphen;line way to very stressful work&hyphen;related activity and have to deal with people who are often very angry in very difficult circumstances, and as well they are dealing with those people while being grossly underresourced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, we should be trying a broader approach to dealing with the issue of stress. A few years ago a report called the Toohey report put forward a number of proposals which were pro&hyphen;active and preventative in terms of trying to deal with the phenomenon of stress in the federal Public Service. Some of these recommendations were trialled in Social Security, from memory, and perhaps in DEET as well. I am not aware of the conclusions, but certainly it would be far better for the government to be taking a pro&hyphen;active, preventative approach rather than the punitive 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> approach of simply lifting the bar and trying to knock out a proportion of these claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Things like better management practices and a better federal government approach to employing people would do a great deal to assist in this regard. It is interesting to note that we do not have a uniform situation across all jurisdictions on this issue. It leads to a number of broader points, which I will make in a minute, about the problem that Australia has with respect to its overall workers compensation picture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a retrograde step, in my view. It is particularly unfortunate when you consider that the overall structure of Comcare is essentially quite good. It is certainly better in its benefits structure than the bulk of the state systems, with the possible exception of South Australia, although that has probably changed in recent times. I am not across the detail of what has occurred there in very recent times. Although, historically, the Comcare procedures for making claims and processing claims have generally been pretty ordinary, and certainly inadequate compared with the state systems, the benefit structures have generally been substantially better than have applied in the state systems. In Victoria the Kennett government has literally gutted the Workcare system and turned it into Workcover, creating circumstances where all those other than with various serious injuries are off benefits and back on Commonwealth social security after two years, leading to a substantial cost&hyphen;shifting problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see a situation where there is a substantial lack of uniformity across Australia. All attempts to tackle this have come to nought. Unfortunately, we are likely to see some advance on this issue over the next few years, but it will be uniformity based on the lowest common denominator. That means uniformity at the expense of workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite a good Industry Commission report on this issue came out late 1994 or early 1995 which actually gave some good, hard data about the costs of workplace injuries and how they are actually borne at the moment. It indicated that injured workers themselves bear a very substantial proportion of those costs and employers only bear roughly half in most 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6398"> cases, and in some states less than half, of the total cost to the community of workers injured at work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lack of uniformity is a growing issue because you have an increasing degree of interstate economic activity, different types of businesses, individual workers, more and more individual work activity crosses state lines, the activities of individual companies cross state boundaries and you often have people in quite complex situations. For example, I know of a person who was injured while away on business in a different state. He fell down in the hotel where he was actually staying the night, paid for by his employer. That gave rise to all sorts of complex issues about under what scheme and in what way the employer was liable. We have seen recent changes to the seamen's compensation arrangements pursued in order to preclude forum shopping between the different state systems and the seamen's compensation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government could perhaps argue that this bill aids uniformity because there are more state jurisdictions that have the significant rather than material as their primary determinant of the question of injury. But, as I said, this is uniformity downwards, uniformity at the expense of injured workers and uniformity based on reducing costs only, not on improving the circumstances of injured workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is enormous misunderstanding in the community. I think the honourable member for Dickson's comments today did not help in that regard. There is an enormous stigmatisation of injured workers. There is a perception that most people on workers compensation are frauds and that they are doing things just to bludge off the system. That is a grossly inaccurate perception. There are even simple things. Examples that often come to mind are things like somebody who is off work, injured, on workers compensation with a crook back. They are seen doing work out in the garden or lifting something in their backyard. That therefore leads people to the conclusion that they are a fraud&mdash;a bludger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a friend who had a laminectomy and spinal fusion, which is amongst the most 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> serious operations you can have. He suffered a back injury as a result of falling roughly 20 feet while working as a labourer. He was putting up a tent, from memory, and he sustained a very serious long-term back injury. His answer to those claims was to say, `Well, yes, I sometimes do those things because I do not want to spend my life as a vegetable just lying on a bed or couch all day or sitting around all day. I want to try to do some things that somebody who is physically active will do. What people do not see is that if I am weeding the garden or bending over in the backyard, after I do that, I am then back in my bedroom lying down for two or three hours in considerable pain. That is what they do not see.' People draw all sorts of superficial conclusions based on grossly inaccurate or misleading anecdotal evidence in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was particularly distressing in 1994 when the Victorian state government ran a series of advertisements about Workcover which had a grossly misleading perspective, which presented a totally inaccurate view of what the reality of being an injured worker and being on compensation means. You had the injured worker there with the broken arm&mdash;a nice cliche, the broken arm&mdash;in to the smiling, friendly doctor, then off to the smiling, friendly employer who has worked out the return to work on light duties and `Don't worry, we'll look after you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is garbage. The reality for most injured workers or workers who have got significant, serious injuries is absolutely the reverse. The reality is that they get dealt with by insurance doctors who often treat them appallingly, who do all sorts of outrageous things to them. They get employers who do not care, employers who do not want to go the extra mile to ensure that they can be rehabilitated, employers who say, `Sorry, no light duties, there is nothing we can do for you,' employers who just want to get them off the books, employers who just want to get rid of them, who do not really understand and do not really care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They suffer isolation from work, isolation from workmates, isolation sometimes from their own friends. They suffer marital problems, often marriage breakdown. They suffer 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6399"> the innuendo of their family and friends about whether or not they might be bludging if they have got an injury that is not obvious, if they have not got something like a broken arm in a sling. They suffer from the uncaring insurance doctors who just churn them through like cattle and push and prod them, who are there to prove that they are frauds or bludgers and who think that unless you are in a wheelchair you are capable of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They suffer all sorts of bureaucratic hassles in the compensation system. As I have indicated, Comcare is, in my view, one of the worst, or it certainly was a couple of years ago. For a long period of time it was one of the worst of the various schemes in Australia in this regard. Those hassles are, in my view, sometimes even deliberately designed to actually get rid of people, to make them dispirited and give up and go away, which ultimately reduces the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They suffer massive financial problems. People sometimes lose their house because, no matter how allegedly generous workers comp benefits can be, invariably they do not replace the income the person was previously on. If they have been fairly highly geared, if they have had a high mortgage and a low discretionary income, it is often financially diabolical for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They sometimes suffer harassment from insurance investigators. I have represented injured workers, for example, who have had serious back injuries and who have had insurance investigators throw stones at them in the street to try to make them run so that they can then be filmed running. I have represented injured workers who have had insurance investigators let down the tyres on their car so that they could then be filmed trying to change the tyre. That sort of harassment is not the sort of thing that you see on the tabloid current affairs programs when they are talking about workers comp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And, of course, they suffer all the usual things about the loss of capacity to work, loss of self&hyphen;esteem, the obvious pain and suffering associated with serious injury. So, when you see unions like the CFMEU engaged in industrial action and demonstrations against the Premier of Victoria, these are the reasons 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> why unions take workers compensation very seriously indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The injured workers are amongst the most disadvantaged, maltreated groups of people in our society, and the enforcement of occupational health and safety in our community is very variable and very ordinary. If you kill somebody in a car, you might go to gaol. If you are an employer and through your negligence you kill somebody, you might get a fine. Even if you get a substantial fine, such as in the Nadenbousch case in Victoria a few years ago, where it was $120,000, you can then bankrupt your company and turn up the following day in a different corporate form performing the same sorts of work and potentially in the same circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is long overdue that we start to get serious about these issues in this country. Yes, we need uniform workers compensation legislation, but uniform workers compensation legislation that provides decent benefits for workers, that ensures that seriously injured workers can be rehabilitated and that ensures that employers do honour their obligations and that people do not have to put up with the sorts things that historically injured workers have put up with in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is another small step backwards for injured workers in this society. It tackles one particular group. It is designed to hit a particular perceived problem that should be being addressed in a far more creative and proactive way than simply lifting the bar to claims. That does not solve the problem. It might save the Commonwealth a little bit of money, but it does not ensure that the workplace is better. It does not ensure that there is greater efficiency in terms of how we function as an employer, as a parliament or as a government. It does not address any of those things. All it does is say, `We want to get some of these people off the books and in order to do justify that we put up some grotesquely caricatured examples, one&hyphen;liners based on individual cases,' where we are not being told what the real basis of the case was and what the full substance of the case was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is mean&hyphen;spirited, narrow&hyphen;minded, nasty legislation based on a mean&hyphen;spirited, narrow&hyphen;minded government which is led by a mean&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6400"> spirited, narrow&hyphen;minded and nasty Prime Minister (Mr Howard). It is designed to hit injured workers in a way that I believe is unfair. We should be getting serious as a parliament, and the government should be getting serious, about tackling the broader problems of injured workers in our society, who, as I have indicated, are amongst the most disadvantaged and unfairly treated groups of people in our community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill, I consider it fitting to relate these amendments to industry and small business. The reason for this is that, unlike many members in the House, I have worked hands&hyphen;on as an apprentice fitter and turner in the Bundaberg sugar mills at Fairymead, as a fitter and turner in the coalmines in central Queensland and as an employer in my own small business, a panel beating and spray painting operation in the township of Clermont, also in central Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of safety in the workplace is paramount to all as too often people become complacent. A print that hung on a wall at Blair Athol coalmine where I worked as a fitter and turner sticks firmly in my mind. It said that we are all responsible for our own safety. A sticker glued to many of the mirrors in the washrooms said, `You are now looking at the person responsible for your safety'. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> How true these statements are, and they are especially relevant to this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party would say that people do not rort workers compensation systems as they have very strong safeguards. Those people who have that opinion confirm my point of view that a prerequisite to coming to this place should be to have worked for a living not fudged around the edges of employment in a comfy old chair in the ivory tower of the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have worked in these environments with a couple of hundred employees. I have heard the odd whisper about the possibility of a certain injury to an individual that might have happened on the previous day at a football game or another sporting event. Early the next morning at work the person slips over on a wet concrete floor and claims that he got the injury at work, when others know better. This is what costs the employer an absolute fortune. After the injury is on the record as having happened at work, individuals can come back, under workers compensation, a week, a month or a year later and say that they got the injury at work and need a reconstruction, when they really should have claimed insurance&mdash;particularly if the injury happened at a sporting event, for example football. We have insurances for those sorts of things, but the current system puts the burden back onto the taxpayer and puts the country into major debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is imperative that we have a secure system of insurance for employees in this country. If we keep going as we are, we will not have any employers to employ the people. It costs an employer a fortune every year in workers comp and it is one of the reasons that small business is trying to work without taking on additional staff. When I had my panel shop and employed a few staff, the thousands of dollars that I sank into the system was enough to drive you to drink&mdash;thank God I do not&mdash;and I never had claim. I spent thousands of dollars on workers compensation and I never had a claim. I had all the necessary equipment and we worked safely in my panel shop. If one of my people got hurt, I would pay for the treatment myself. I would not send the person off and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6401"> claim workers compensation, because it would cost so much in increased premiums. It was not worth the trouble. A lot of other employers do that too. If they can get away with not having to claim a workers compensation injury for someone in the workplace, they will, because they cannot afford the increased premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why we have to look at the system to try to get one that is fairer for all. At the moment, the system is open to rorting and it costs the country too much money. Many employers are not far off going to the wall because they cannot afford the increased premiums. In Queensland, when there was a change of government and the National&hyphen;Liberal coalition took over, we saw the great damage that had been done by Labor to the workers compensation system. Interestingly, one of your Labor mates was running the show&mdash;Mr Wayne Goss, the former Premier of Queensland. That is a familiar name. As I understand it, he is trying to get into the federal parliament in the coming election. That will be interesting. He wants to try to drive the federal system to the wall as well.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LK6">Mr MAREK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for drawing that to my attention and for bringing me back to the debate. This topic makes people anxious. It concerns so many people. You can understand why we are drawn to make those sorts of statements. I will mention some statements from the Economics Legislation Committee's paper so that people can understand the reasons for these amendments. This bill is the direct result of amendments announced in the 1996 budget to clarify the circumstances in which compensation is payable through the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth workers compensation scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 so that Comcare is responsible for determining the amount payable by the department or authority. There is provision for a department or authority to seek a review of the amount determined. This review will be conducted by Comcare in the first instance and then, if the department or authority so wishes, by the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further in relation to the statement put out by the committee, the schedule proposes a number of other amendments. These include that Comcare shall provide advice on occupational health and safety matters to employers&mdash;either on its own initiative or on request; transfer certain powers in relation to investigations from the commission to the chief executive officer of Comcare; increase the maximum penalties that can be imposed under the act; ensure that a document which is cited in the act's regulations has effect as amended from time to time without the need to amend the regulations; and also require that a document which is incorporated in a code of practice be available for inspection at the offices of Comcare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 2 of the bill proposes to amend the act to allow the chief executive officer of Comcare to subdelegate any of the powers or functions delegated by the commission. Schedule 2 amendments will also enable Comcare to charge a fee for the provision of claims management services to class 1 licence holders and will reflect an existing administrative arrangement whereby the Northern Territory government reimburses Comcare for payment of compensation to certain persons and associated administrative costs. Amendments in schedule 2 will ensure that compensation benefits are maintained at a minimum level of 70 per cent of indexed normal weekly earnings in all cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes to the system relating to the definition of disease are designed to strengthen the connection between work and the compensable injury. Currently, a workplace 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6402"> must make a material contribution to a worker's disease before compensation is payable. Under this bill, the changes to the workplace contribution test will be upgraded from `material' to `significant'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unions appear to be stressing out over the Industrial Relations Legislation Bill 1996, which seeks to make amendments to the Occupational Health and Safety Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. They are not claiming this legislation will lead to an increased work load, creating the need for subsequent occupational stress leave or workers compensation. But they might as well be saying that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are more than 100,000 workers compensation claims a year in Queensland alone, and a lot of those claims are fictitious, as has been proven. We have seen photographs in newspapers of people working and actively playing sport while being paid to recover from these fictitious injuries&mdash;and their supposed injuries are the result of real accidents in the workplace and not imaginary stress related problems! While workers must be provided with reasonable compensation for bona fide claims, a considerable number of people in the work force have abused the system, which has spoiled it for everyone. It is important to get that point across today: we probably would not have this legislation if the system had not been rorted. People know that. This all comes back to the fact that the odd few have spoilt the system for the others, and that fact needs to go down on the record and be expressed. This legislation has had to be brought in because the odd few got in and spoiled things for everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employees who are injured as a result of work must be compensated, as I was saying, but the employees who blame work for their invisible, non&hyphen;physical injuries will have to prove their case beyond a shadow of a doubt. That is not a bad resolution, but one area I am concerned about is the definition of disease. This bill states that regard must be given to whether the claimant would have contracted or suffered the aggravation of their ailment in spite of their employment. This provision will require the compensation authority and medical advisers to assess 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whether the disease occurred outside the person's employment: diseases such as asbestosis, lead poisoning and the like can be contracted outside as well as inside the workplace. However, if it is proven that an employer or management did not take reasonable action to protect their employees, compensation is applicable. That is fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the diseases we know little about at present? How will the authorities be able to assess those, if there has been no previous test case in the worker's environment? I would like to see the legislation be more responsible when it comes to issues like this, so that we do promote a safe and healthy working environment. But these diseases are tangible; they do occur in the work place and must be acknowledged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New ailments such as stress and RSI are not tangible and can be caused by outside influences or non&hyphen;work related activities. We should attempt to tighten up on claims for such ailments by putting the onus onto the employee to prove beyond a shadow of doubt that their so&hyphen;called injuries are the result of employer negligence and are connected to the job of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until now, it has been too easy for people to claim compensation for psychological and non&hyphen;physical impairment. Evidence of this abuse of the system is to be found in a 1993&hyphen;94 survey of the causes of stress claims which was conducted by Comcare. That survey found that interpersonal conflict was given as the cause of 24 per cent of stress claims. Another 24 per cent of stress claims were said to have been caused by workloads and dead lines, while the cause given for 22 per cent of the claims was organisational change. Physical and verbal abuse was cited as the cause of another 17 per cent of claims, and seven per cent were said to have been caused by performance counselling and other management processes. Forced relocation and organisational restructuring were said to cause a final six per cent of these claims. These are legitimate claims, yet politicians and their staff experience such problems on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis, and they get on with the job as designated or find alternative employment. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6403">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unions do not like the clause which states that consideration of the claimant's private life and lifestyle be taken into account when claims are made. They are well aware that a considerable number of previous claimants have made claims for injuries that have not originated in the workplace or that have only been exacerbated by work and not caused by it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a shame that this government repeatedly throws the baby out with the bathwater. It was evident from the speech of the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) that the thrust of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 is to attempt to address perceived rorters. I think he went so far as to say that, if it had not been for those instances of rorters, there would not be a need for this legislation. But members of the government say that without bringing before the House the full details of instances where they allege rorting has occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I share the concerns of the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), in that the other day the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) came and gave in summary form accounts of claims which he regarded as inappropriate. If they were inappropriate claims and those people could not establish a material causal connection to stress arising in the course of their work, Comcare had every opportunity to dispute them and, if they were disputed, those people had the opportunity to go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, where they would have been obliged to prove their case beyond the balance of probability.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the member for Capricornia's statement that workers will now be required to prove their case beyond a shadow of a doubt is already the case. Any worker who challenges a ruling denying him compensation has to prove their case on the balance of probability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of knowing how the system works, I was a member of a legal firm for 14 years that did more than its fair share of workers compensation cases. And, yes, while you did get a small percentage of people through your door who were less than genuine, the great majority were genuine, deserving cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a big difference in approach between someone looking at circumstances put up as a facade of massive rorting and a judge looking at the specific facts presented to him in respect of the individual circumstances of the case, as the member for Melbourne indicated. I would go so far as to say that it is a misuse of our position as members of parliament to be overly simplistic and overly dramatic in terms of cases which are fundamentally devastating to the lives of the workers involved, and indeed fundamentally devastating to the lives of their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures show there is not an excessive number of stress claims, and it is a declining number. What appears to be going awry in terms of the costs some stress claims are placing on the system is the length of time some people have off work. That may be the result of lack of motivation of the particular worker, but it may equally be an indication that the rehabilitation procedures adopted by the employer are not working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence in my research of stress claims is that the longer a worker is away from work, the less likely they are to be able to return because of the apprehensions involved. I recall that, in my early career as a lawyer, I was involved in a case where a payroll manager of a very substantial company had a nervous breakdown, which we were able to prove was a result of the pressures of his work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That company, however, was more sophisticated in its approach to rehabilitation and offered him work initially as a cleaner of the factory floor. While there would be an argument that that may not have been suitable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6404"> selective duty employment in terms of the experience, seniority and skills of that payroll manager, he was more than happy to take that role because he saw the physical side of the job and his opportunity to interact with other workers on the factory floor literally as being therapeutic, and indeed it was. He successfully recovered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying that, in every case of a senior manager, it is appropriate to offer that senior manager menial tasks. More often than not, that is done by employers to try to call their bluff and to find a mechanism to cut them off workers compensation. But there are means whereby, with a bit of dedication and by going that extra mile, as the member for Melbourne said, successful rehabilitation programs can be instigated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that the reason stress sufferers are staying too long away from work is poor rehabilitation schemes. But rather than look at those poor rehabilitation schemes, the government is throwing out the protective mechanism, the whole security, that workers compensation has provided now for decades for a very large number of workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said it is not doing it for reasons of cost cutting. That is quite surprising when one looks at the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum, which states that the savings described to accrue directly from the amendments are $3 million in 1996-97, $10 million in 1997-98 and $16 million rising to $24 million in 1999&hyphen;2000. To say there is no desire to cost&hyphen;cut at the benefit of workers' security is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that Comcare premiums are among the lowest when compared with state workers compensation premiums. Premiums actually dropped from 1.7 per cent of the payroll in 1995-96 to 1.6 per cent in 1996-97, and all of Comcare's liabilities are fully funded. Against that background, there is no need to make these cost savings at the cost of the security of workers and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it has to be said that the number of stress claims among public servants is slightly higher, and only slightly higher, than in the broader community, those stress claims are entirely consistent with expert analysis. For 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> instance, Dr Ann Williamson of Worksafe Australia has said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is good evidence that people who manage people are more stressed than those that manage millions of dollars worth of machinery.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Capricornia gave an account of his panel beating workshop. While, yes, there were time pressures and so forth and they were operating machinery, the evidence suggests that, in a managerial or personal interaction framework, the stress factors can be more pronounced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, there is a risk of this government seeing another opportunity to condemn public servants not only as being bludgers but now as `Captain Rats' and rorters. The government says the Public Service is a bad thing and anything we can do to cut cost at the expense of the Public Service is a good thing. It is part of this atmosphere of contempt for the public sector and, hence, the reason for the retraction of so many government services. Perhaps that is digressing a little from the thrust of the legislation, but one can see that thinking underlying the whole approach of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other unfortunate thing about this bill is that it is going to go further in stigmatising those who submit stress claims. The best evidence indicates that stress claims which are actually reported are only the tip of the iceberg. A recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in February this year stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research shows that although workers compensation is the most visible measure of contemporary workplace stress, it is only the tip of the iceberg.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A vast number of cases of work stress do not result in claims, said Dr John Toohey, teacher of occupational health and safety management at the University of NSW.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dr Toohey said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stress currently accounts for 4 per cent to 6 per cent of national claims. For every one that reached that level, there are 10 others that did not make a claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These still resulted in significant lost time and poor productivity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, in terms of the analysis by the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), and I agree with the member for Melbourne, he substantially made a balanced contribution to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6405"> debate, but he referred to the fact that people take time off as a result of stress because they are entitled to compensation for doing so. He referred to his conversations with a number of people who have made stress claims, perhaps in his practice as a barrister, and he said to them, `What would happen if you weren't able to access compensation?' and they said, `We wouldn't have taken the time off.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Dr Toohey is saying that, even if they do not take the time off, the overall workplace for productivity of that workplace are knocked about. It has really had a tremendously damaging impact on the productivity of the workplace. If you want a public service which has low morale, if you want a public service which has low productivity, you leave or force people who are incapable of performing their duties in that situation, rather than looking at why they are having problems performing their duties and addressing that situation so that you keep a productive and motivated work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other clear point of irony that comes out in the legislation at this time is that it is occurring at a time when the government has massively cut the Public Service and is talking about further massive restructuring. That, clearly, is going to be a situation which generates added stress. From her clinical experience with all her patients, Mirella Heath Green, a registered psychologist, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today recession&hyphen;driven stress appears to dominate the workplace. The stories I hear from clients come to have a familiar ring. Not surprisingly the ever&hyphen;present fear of redundancy looms large, as does worry about closure of the whole organisation or department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As staff members are rationalised those who are left say they experience pressure to take on the workload previously carried by two or three people. No matter whether this perception is realistic or not, the anxiety is real and this is what causes stress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People talk of too many or impossible deadlines and of an excessive number of projects on hand at any one time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally, they feel pushed beyond their capacity to perform. Fear of failure sets in; interpersonal conflicts are magnified and mismanaged; and because the perceived dangers of stress have been widely publicised, the fear of fear syndrome sends 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its victims into a downward spiral of physical and emotional dysfunction.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Rather than address the reality that that situation is occurring in so much of the work force in this day and age, particularly in the Public Service, the government is turning its back on addressing the causes. In terms of managing stress, it is interesting to note that Ms Green goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No matter what happens, don't see yourself as a victim.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This legislation specifically requires the worker to portray themselves as a victim of unreasonable management practices if they are to succeed. The evidence is that it is completely contrary to the established and recommended ways of addressing stress and itself will be an aggravating source. In a further publication, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said that the requirement to impose upon a worker `to find fault so as to justify a claim, may in itself lead to an exacerbation or prolongation of the stress'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, this is where the government is heading with its legislation, which it has not thought through. That really should be condemned. Further evidence suggests:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . occupational stress impacts on all aspects of life, it must be considered as a public health issue that needs to be addressed through organisational and individual programs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The consequences of occupational stress flow through to the family in terms of marital discord and even discord with children. They flow through to the amount of illness in the community generally and hence the demands on Medicare. But, rather than looking at addressing stress as a public health issue which is going to place its own demands on the community, the government has, with a very short&hyphen;sighted focus, looked at these cost cutting measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the government has been extremely short&hyphen;sighted in its approach and, worse than that, draconian in its methodology. For instance, as the member for Capricornia has said, before a worker can establish their entitlement to compensation, there is going to be an analysis as to whether the worker is likely to have otherwise succumbed to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6406"> particular disease, irrespective of their employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was quite alarmed to learn, according to the analysis of the member for Capricornia, that, in cases where asbestos or lead poisoning are involved, workers will now bear an onus of proof to establish that their outside activities did not contribute to their condition. In many cases, that will be an impossible onus of proof. Anyone who has seen a victim dying of mesothelioma as a result of asbestos exposure will know that having to bear such an onus of proof is harsh and draconian in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Workers are going to be subject to an analysis as to whether they had any medical predisposition. Any worker who brings a claim is now going to have their medical records gone through with a fine toothcomb. The tribunal will be required to consider the activities of the employee which are not related to his or her employment, such as&mdash;as the explanatory memorandum says&mdash;domestic, social, sporting, educational or community activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private investigators are going to be knocking on the doors of neighbours asking what a worker's marital relationship is like and whether their kids have any problems at school. It is awfully intrusive. I know the way these legal cases are contested. It is not an overstatement at all to say that private investigators are going to make a windfall gain out of this legislation. Of course, there is the general catch&hyphen;all&mdash;any other matters which might affect the employee's health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private investigators will be following an employee who has lodged a stress claim to see whether that employee goes down to the pub of an afternoon. Hence, one can imagine the employee being cross&hyphen;examined by a barrister as to whether he has a drinking problem because a private investigator has a film of him going into the local Kings Head Tavern. It is very much the element of fault that will be coming into workers compensation cases now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next thing of real concern are the words in the legislation `reasonable managerial or administrative action'. This is where the draftsmanship is particularly poor. A court 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will not be able to fathom what that means. For instance, air traffic controllers will have an additional workload because of the opening of the east&hyphen;west runway at Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport. Will the stress be a result of their daily normal work or the result of a managerial decision to reopen the east&hyphen;west runway and run the risks associated with that operation? The legislation is completely unclear on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is poorly drafted. It is motivated by misconception at the very least, but more likely an ignorance of approach because it has failed to address stress. It attempts to punish those who suffer stress and, worse, their families. This government really needs to be condemned for its mean, short&hyphen;sighted and ignorant approach to the reality of working life in this day and age.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot help but disagree with most of what the previous speaker has said. In essence, this legislation tidies up the sloppy legislation that was made unworkable by the previous government and which allowed rorts and abuse to happen at the taxpayers' expense. I believe the result of March 1996 has allowed the taxpaying public to seek redress of this legislation. The rorters and abusers of this system cannot go on forever. The cost to the public is too great. This legislation is designed to quantify and qualify the circumstances under which injury or recompense is allowed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to be a member of this government, to bite the bullet and tackle the difficult issues of workplace reform which were so sadly neglected and ignored by the previous government. This legislation is part of a package designed to redress years of policy complacency&mdash;a complacency that did not reflect the benefits which could be enjoyed through positive contributions, harmony and cooperation from all parties in the workplace and on the shop floor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill makes a number of changes to the industrial relations legislation, changes which the former government tried to make but were either unwilling or unable to carry through. The three most significant changes are amendments to the definitions of `disease' and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6407"> `injury' and the transferring of responsibility for the determining of contributions and premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me elaborate on the first two of these points. In redefining the terms `disease' and `injury' this amendment to the current legislation will achieve what the original architects had planned. In 1988, the then government introduced reforms to the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme. Central to those reforms was a failed attempt to clarify circumstances under which workers could claim compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The change was deemed necessary because, under the then current legislation, a worker only needed to show that his or her employment was a contributing factor to their condition. With such a liberal definition, it is little wonder that the Commonwealth was liable for payouts for diseases which had little or no connection with the person's employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To their credit, the previous government decided that this needed to be changed. The intention was to make the tests tougher by insisting that employment contributed a material degree to the contraction of the disease. In introducing the bill, the minister of the day said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the test will require an employee to demonstrate that his or her employment was more than a mere contributing factor in the contraction of the disease. Accordingly, it will be necessary for an employee to show that there is a close connection between the disease and the employment in which he or she is engaged.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The intention was there, but was the will? I would say not. This is proved by a case which went before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This tribunal ruled that `material' meant `pertinent or likely to influence'. What did this mean? It meant that once again employees could claim compensation for illnesses which were in no way connected to their job. Over time, the interpretation has become closer to the point where the government was back to scratch. Of course, this should not surprise anyone as this is the way the unions would have wanted it. As we all know, under Labor, what the unions wanted the unions got. For whom was this situation most beneficial? Not your hardworking, honest and dutiful employee; this circum 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stance encouraged rogues and rorters to abuse a very generous benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two ways to reduce the number of payouts for work related illness, of which stress is the most common complaint. The first is by tightening the rules relating to payouts and the second is by better management practices. Better management practices have led to a decrease in the number of claims. But this has not led to a corresponding decrease in the cost of complexity of those claims. In fact, as of June 1995, the Commonwealth's liabilities totalled almost $1&half; billion&mdash;I repeat: $1&half; billion&mdash;of lost productivity. Of these costs the majority comes from claims of stress related illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Twenty-seven per cent of the total workers compensation payouts went to stress claims, despite the fact these claims made up only 13 per cent of all claims. To put this in terms of time lost, the average stress claim had workers off the job for 11 weeks compared to 3&half; weeks for all other claims. The average stress claim cost to the Commonwealth is $32,000 whereas the average non-stress claim cost is $7,700. The overall cost of stress claims rose 30 per cent in the years from 1991 to 1995, climbing from $24 million to $37 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a puzzlement. The number of claims dropped, but the cost of each claim increased. In fact, the 30 per cent increase arose over a period of four years. What a growth industry. Was there no concern or reaction to such an increase? What workplace conditions created such conditions? With the previous Labor government bosses directing traffic, who could blame them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Neither I nor this government are for one minute suggesting that stress is not a very real disease. I have seen stress affect the strongest of people in a variety of occupations. Being a teacher in a previous work life, I can attest to the stress of the day-to-day workplace. I would suggest that there are a number of politicians in this House who would suffer some degree of stress, and a considerable proportion of their staff would suffer likewise. But in good colloquial terms: if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But stress is an odd thing. It comes about for a variety of reasons, not the least of it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6408"> being financial strain. Other contributors can be family problems&mdash;either with the partner or the children&mdash;concern over failure, both social and in the workplace; a heavy workload; and unrealistic expectations from an employer. Is it therefore reasonable for the government as an employer to pick up the tab for every stress related claim put to it without some concrete proof that it was the workplace that caused the problem? I do not think so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We live in stressful times. In days gone by, when the world travelled at a much slower pace, stress was not something common in the workplace and it was virtually unheard of in the home. Now it is as common as the common cold. Students at high school and road workers laying pavement all seem to be suffering from some form of stress. Why is everyone so stressed? Again, this can be for a variety of reasons, as I pointed out earlier. But what we can we do about it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with most illnesses, prevention is better than cure. The government realises this and has put its weight behind a number of preventative projects being run by Comcare and other agencies and through a joint working party established under the Australian Public Service Agreement. Following the establishment of the Stress Claims Management Centre in January 1995, claims management has improved greatly. However, this has not stopped workers from making stress related claims due to action taken by management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, it is a widely held belief that in a number of such cases employees are making stress related claims as an avenue to registering complaints against management or to stop some form of managerial action. For example, an employee working in a team has not been pulling his weight. This places an extra workload on the other team members and caused problems with management. The office manager warns the employee that disciplinary action may follow if the assigned work is not completed. The employee, who is having financial problems outside the workplace, decides that it is all getting too hard and puts in a stress claim. The stress is very real but not caused by the workplace. Under the current legislation the government would foot the bill while his employee takes stress leave. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Under the proposed changes, the government would not be liable for this claim. However, this is not to say that the employer is absolved of all responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Good management practices would dictate that employees who are suffering from outside pressures are given some latitude with respect to duties. I am not suggesting that employees should be allowed to slacken off, but perhaps other duties may be found which the employee could better handle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The intention of this bill is not to stop all claims but to filter those that are of a fraudulent or frivolous nature. I would like to give you another example, an actual occurrence which relates to a section which the minister alluded to in his second reading speech. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By restating the threshold requirement of work&hyphen;relatedness, the government is reactivating the original intention of the scheme that, for a disease to be compensable, employment must be a significant or substantial cause of the disease. In particular, where a disease is not the result of a clearly distinguishable incident in the workplace or is attributed to multiple causes, the amendments will properly ensure that Commonwealth employers do not bear the cost of something for which they have only limited, or no actual, moral responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The case I will refer to went on for almost two years and involved a Commonwealth public servant. It was brought to my attention by a constituent of mine who was working in the same department. The claimant was leaving home one morning and slipped on her front stairs. This caused a substantial injury to her back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current legislation, once a person leaves their front door they are covered by the Commonwealth. I am not sure how this woman slipped. Perhaps the stairs were wet, maybe she was rushing to catch the bus or she may have tripped on the dog. This point is not important. What is important is that she lodged a workers compensation claim and it was approved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the next two years this woman lived off the system. She was given every opportunity to improve her condition and to get back to work. Being on the heavy side, she was advised by her doctor that losing weight was essential to full recovery. To this end, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6409"> government paid for her to attend a dietitian, paid two years worth of gym fees and paid for intensive physiotherapy. However it was all to no avail. The woman did not want to help herself. During this two&hyphen;year period this person raised her child at home and continued with her daily household chores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a mother of three you can take my word for it that going to work each day is a damned sight easier than running around after the kids&mdash;it is certainly easier on the body. Obviously this woman had a medical condition. However, for two years the government footed the bill for this woman to stay home. And why? Because she slipped on the front steps of her own home, something that could have happened at any time of the day or night, weekend or weekday. It was just fortunate that it happened when she was on her way to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely this injury could not be considered to have resulted from her employment. If that person had been picking up a box at work or had even slipped on the tiles in the kitchen of her workplace, we could see a connection. Again, I stress that the government is not trying to cut off an employee's right to make claims, either stress or physically related. All we are trying to do is to make sure that such claims are related to the person's employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to stress claims, the unions and the opposition will no doubt be up in arms over the proposed changes. In fact, the shadow minister has accused the government of legislating stress claims out of existence. I would like to ask: where were the stress claims ten years ago? Why has this issue over a period of time raised its ugly head?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Public Sector Union claims that the legislation pre-empts the findings of the heads of workers compensation authorities report. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the heads of workers compensation authorities report has recommended that compensation for stress be limited by providing that stress which arises from reasonable employer action, taken in a reasonable manner, regarding discipline, non-promotion, termination and similar matters of workplace management is not compensable. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The minister has taken this into account when writing this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition of `injury' in the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act will be amended to provide that compensation is not payable in respect of injury which arises solely or predominantly out of reasonable managerial or administrative action taken in a reasonable manner by the employer in connection with an employee's employment&mdash;a fair and just assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his second reading speech, the minister set out some examples of reasonable managerial or administrative action. For the benefit of those present who may have missed these examples, I will enlighten you further. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . reasonable managerial or administrative action would include action taken in a reasonable manner to reclassify, transfer, demote, discipline, counsel or redeploy an employee, or cease the employee's employment. It would also cover a decision based on reasonable grounds not to promote, reclassify, transfer or grant leave of absence to an employee. Employer action relating to the restructure and reorganisation of the Australian Public Service would also constitute reasonable managerial or administrative action.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It has to be said that this in no way impinges on the rights of employees to make a stress related claim if the stress stems from an extremely high workload or unreasonable expectations from an employer. Nor will the changes affect an employee's right to claim compensation for physical injury caused by the working environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the shadow minister's comments, his government made a failed attempt to correct this problem in 1988. For various reasons, not the least of which would have been pressure from the Commonwealth and Public Sector Union, the Labor government dropped the amendments like a hot potato. As we have seen with all forms of industrial and workplace reforms, Labor just did not have the guts to make the changes which have been so desperately needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Bowman I have workers from all walks of life. I have almost 4,500 small businesses which would employ, on average, four workers each. I have more than 20 schools which employ an average of 20 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6410"> staff. I have six major shopping centres which employ hundreds of staff in a variety of positions. There is no doubt that many of these people would suffer from stress of one variety or another but would never consider claiming workers compensation. Then they hear about stories such as the ones I have outlined earlier. Is it little wonder that the reputation of the Australian Public Service is so poor?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general public really deals with public servants only when they have a problem. If their problem is not solved quickly and efficiently, they complain that public servants are lazy and inefficient. Having been in constant contact with a large number of these public servants, nothing could be further from the truth. Sure, there are one or two who spoil things for the majority, as there are in all industries. However, the majority of those I deal with are hard workers trying to cope with a demanding public and an antiquated and hopelessly out of date set of rules and regulations&mdash;rules and regulations, I might add, the majority of which were set up by the former administration over 13 years of hopeless mismanagement of the Commonwealth Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government proposes to lift the image of the Public Service by weeding out those who wish to make both fraudulent and frivolous claims. The public at large want an efficient and effective Public Service. This legislation is moving towards improving the circumstances of and benefiting those in the workplace. By making these changes we will not only improve the service's image but also ensure the financial viability of the scheme is not jeopardised by the payment of compensation for diseases and injuries which have little or no connection with the employment and stress which have arisen solely out of the reasonable management of the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that, among all our government's positive contributions to reform, this legislation is a cog in the wheel of progress towards an efficient and effective workplace. After 13 years of gross mismanagement, it was inevitable that we, the government, would be forced to clean up the mess. It has been said that action springs not from thought 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but from a readiness for responsibility. That is the difference between the current government and the opposition: they thought about changing the system; we now have the responsibility for doing it. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say at the outset how pleased I am to hear the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bowman (Mrs West), praise public sector workers as much as she did. I look forward to her perpetuating that view throughout the ranks of those opposite. May that be reflected by their future comments on the public sector within the ACT. In most cases, it is derided by those opposite around the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said previously in this debate and has been outlined by the previous speaker, stress is not an issue which is restricted to the Public Service or to Canberra&mdash;nor is it an Australian phenomenon. Overseas experience has shown that occupational stress is not peculiar to either of those areas. It is a new threat to occupational health, symptomatic of post-industrial society. I am told that in the USA stress claims, which have trebled since 1980 and are estimated to cost $150 billion annually, represent 15 per cent of all occupational disease claims. In the UK, for instance, the cost of stress accounts for 3.5 per cent of gross national product, GNP, and the loss of 40 million working days a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of stress to the Commonwealth is assessed by measuring the frequency and the duration of the claims. Because stress claims take five years to mature on average, the actual compensation cost of stress claims are best considered having regard to the 1989-90 data, which demonstrated that the cost of a stress claim averaged $17,517 compared with just under $5,000 for other claims. It should also be noted that this is the result of the expanded duration of those claims. In 1989-90, the average incapacity duration was 28.22 weeks for stress claims and 7.47 weeks for others. The most recent figures show a decline in both the actual duration of stress claims and the average duration of stress claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely no doubt that the work that has been undertaken over recent years to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6411"> address this has started to take effect. Much of the reduction can be attributed to the efforts of the SRC Commission and Comcare in prevention activities. This should not be ignored in this debate. It is very important to note that much attention and effort have been put into addressing the very real human cost, let alone the dollar cost, of stress claims. Present trends indicate a decline in the frequency of claims from 6.6 per hundred Commonwealth employees in 1995-96 to 6.07 claims per hundred in 1996-97, testimony to the hard work and attention which have been given to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research into the spread of workplace stress in the Commonwealth indicates that it is experienced as a response to work processes, workplace organisation and management practices. This outcome is reflected in an examination of the 1993-94 stress claims determined by Comcare, which showed that the following seemed to be the cause of stress claims: interpersonal conflict, workload and deadline, organisational change, physical and verbal abuse, performance counselling and other management processes and forced relocation and organisational restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it interesting to refer to those particular half dozen causes when I reflect on some of the comments made by the member for Bowman and other speakers and when we refer to and think about the exceptions that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) is attempting to bring into force with the changes to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill. I am in a fairly unique position as a member of parliament representing a part of the ACT as over many years I have had a very close association with a wide range of people employed in the public sector. I said earlier this week in the adjournment debate on this subject that, when we talk about stress claims and proper recompense for workers compensation, we must not forget the human element.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker and others have made mention of the fact that workplace conditions are a very real contributing factor to stress related claims in the public sector work force. It is ironic that those opposite can stand here straight-faced and make that reference. I am 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very aware of the additional stress that is being created right now in the public sector workplace as a result of the dramatic cuts to the public sector work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know personally of a number of cases where the breadwinner of the family goes home after a 12- to 16-hour day, their having now been put into the position&mdash;thank heavens&mdash;of retaining employment but doing the work of four, five or six people. To me, the implication of that is fairly straightforward. During the adjournment debate earlier this week, when I brought this up, a couple of members opposite made a point of saying that it does not sound much different from those who work in small business&mdash;that they have an equivalent number of hours to work and work under similar stress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I make this point: the government stands here often claiming to be representative of, caring for and supporters of small business, and I endorse that. But I do not see the same level of concern in relation to those who work in the public sector and find themselves with no control whatsoever, doing everything they can to retain a position of employment and having all of this additional stress put upon them, and I am talking of real human cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You also have the alternative, where public servants&mdash;and I know of some of these people as well&mdash;who have worked in sections of the public sector that have been sold off, contracted out, to private enterprise are employed by the private sector. I know of one case in particular where the young family man concerned has been fortunate enough&mdash;he tells me how lucky he is; in the sell-off, he was paid out a very small amount; he had not been in the public sector for many years&mdash;to be re&hyphen;employed through the new private sector contracting arrangement. But, as a result of that, even though he is very pleased to be in that position, he is now working a 10-, 12- or 14-hour five-day week, plus a compulsory full day on the weekend in most cases. So his family life has taken a dramatic turn. He is not complaining, as I said, because he has maintained employment. But we all have to acknowledge the additional stress that has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6412"> been put upon that person and that family unit as a result of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A community service in my electorate is now putting regular columns in the local newspaper talking about how families need to address the additional levels of stress, given the economic conditions that apply in the ACT, particularly within the public sector, as a result of the changes this government has wrought. So, while we are examining legislation to change the circumstances under which stress related claims may be paid within the public sector, it would be remiss of us, and I think quite hypocritical of anybody in this place, to remove out of our thought processes these sorts of instances. We cannot have it both ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effects of the legislation are really quite simple. It changes from `material degree' to `significant degree' the connection required between the workplace and the injury. This means that liability will be denied where the cause of the injury is `solely or predominantly' because of `reasonable management or administrative action taken in a reasonable manner by the employer in connection with employment'. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), in his second reading speech, said that the government had considered the basic principles of workers compensation, the current and future position and performance of the Comcare scheme and the interim heads of workers compensation authorities' report. However, there is no general principle of workers compensation that excludes injuries that were otherwise caused by workplace conditions. The second proposal seems to fundamentally conflict with the no-fault notion of workers compensation by introducing reasonableness as a criterion for compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look briefly at the present approach to determining liability for stress. It is not sufficient currently to just claim stress. There has to be some proper medically diagnosable condition which is recognised as such by the medical profession. The onus of proof is on employees to establish contribution of a material degree. The second reading speech of the 1988 Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act is very clear on this. It states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the test will require an employee to demonstrate that his or her employment was more than a mere contributing factor in the contraction of the disease. Accordingly, it will be necessary for an employee to show that there is a close connection between the disease and the employment in which he or she was engaged.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Thirdly, and most importantly, there is a significant hurdle to overcome in establishing contribution. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In determining material contribution of employment the Stress Claims Management Centre will examine the factors precipitating the stress and the various reports on the events in the workplace from parties involved including the claimant and the employing agency.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister has argued that workers compensation has been awarded to Commonwealth employees for stress related conditions that have arisen as a result of counselling for poor work performance, counselling about failure to get a promotion and other actions taken by management as part of the normal day-to-day operations of the Australian Public Service. By providing an exclusion from liability in relation to injury or disease which takes place as a result of reasonable management action, the government is undertaking a wide-ranging and serious change in workers compensation entitlements. The effect is to deny compensation entitlements to all workers suffering stress related disease in circumstances other than where the employer has acted negligently or unreasonably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reasonableness test will have all the shortcomings of common law processes that statutory workers compensation schemes attempted to avoid. Under this test, those workers who do not fully understand the new rules are likely not to be compensated, because the absence of knowledge would tend to show management action was reasonable. Rather than promoting a culture of cure, this test promotes a culture of excuse. In an environment of cost cutting, the provision of an out for liability on the basis of reasonableness will see the focus of management change to justifying an injury as reasonable rather than trying to prevent it. The vague and subjective notions of reasonableness will lead only to an explosion of litigation as employers and employees attempt to define the undefinable. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6413">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we think about how we could have a better approach to this whole subject, there are other things we need to keep in mind. There has always been a strong recognition by the industrial parties of the need to address the issues associated with stress. The stress management centre was established in 1985 to provide a holistic approach to incorporate prevention strategies, improved administrative arrangements and more effective rehabilitation into management practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past 18 months specifically, the SIC Commission has been committed to the development of a prevention program to deal specifically with stress. The program advocates the integration of prevention initiatives in mainstream management practice. This is fundamental to the effective reduction of stress claims which do not show up elsewhere. This holistic approach is the opposite of the piecemeal approach of drawing artificial lines in the sand, as the government's proposals do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only reiterate in the most strongest of terms the human reality of trying to remain and retain fairness and equity in the workers compensation scheme in relation to stress. In doing so, there is absolutely no way that I or any of my colleagues, I am sure I am right in saying, endorse in any fashion any rorting of this or any other government scheme. But there has to be a bottom line in terms of being able to understand, acknowledge and accept the individuals who work in the public sector. As previous speakers have said in relation to this bill&mdash;although they do not usually say it in relation to other bills&mdash;they have admiration for those who work in the public sector in their own electorates, and therefore I assume also within the ACT, where the majority of them are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to impress on the government as much as I possibly can that they should very carefully consider what they are actually changing here and that they remain cognisant of the fact that, under the current circumstances, unfortunately we may see, at least within the ACT and I imagine in other places as well, an increase in stress related claims. That will not be because of some artificial measuring, because they have all become 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rorters or because they need two years off to look after children, as some speakers have suggested. The government placing more stress than we have ever seen on people within the public sector will be because of the current attitude of this government, because of their application of that to the Australian Public Service and because of their absolute mania for cutting numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst that remains the case, whilst they have that attitude and that ideological approach, I think that they can fully expect an increase in stress claims at a time when they appear to be hell bent on reducing them, or at least reducing the bottom line dollar cost, without, unfortunately, considering the human cost. I implore the minister and his colleagues to think carefully about what they are creating by going down this path.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I would want to say that I listened very carefully to the contribution made by the honourable member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis). I do, however, want to point out to her that this government does not have a mania for cutting numbers. What we have, of course, is a determination to restore the budget to surplus. I do not want to go over the well&hyphen;ploughed ground that prior to the last election we were notified by the Labor Party that the budget was in surplus but the reality was, as we found out on the Monday after the poll, that there was a $10.3 billion deficit. Thus, the government must rein in costs and expenditure. The government appreciates that one is not able to spend more than one earns. Regrettably, as a by-product of that need to cut costs it has been necessary to reduce numbers in the Commonwealth Public Service. So while we do not have a mania for cutting numbers, as the honourable member for Namadgi would have us believe, we do have a determination to run this country in a very sound manner economically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, which is before the chamber today, is partly technical in nature and partly of greater substance. This legislation amends two acts. Some of the amendments are a matter not of controversy and others, as one heard when one listened to the honourable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6414"> member for Namadgi, clearly are. A number of significant changes are included in the legislation, and amongst these is the amendment to the definition of `disease' in the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 so that it must be established that employment contributed to a significant degree to an employee's disease. Currently, the test refers to the wider notion of material degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there is an amendment to the definition of `injury' so that, in general, work related stress claims cannot be pursued if they arise predominantly out of reasonable managerial or administrative action undertaken in a reasonable manner even if such action contributed in a significant degree to the disease. Thirdly, there is an amendment transferring responsibility from the commission for the safety, rehabilitation and compensation of Commonwealth employees to Comcare for determining contributions and premiums paid by each department and Commonwealth authority in relation to the workers compensation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be noted that these reforms were brought forward in response to the budgetary situation inherited by the government when it attained office in March last year. The government was concerned by some very interesting statistics&mdash;statistics which indicated that up to one in three federal public servants are taking stress related leave amid warnings that the cost of stress claims is jeopardising the government's $1.4 billion workers compensation system. I am indebted to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> for that information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consequently, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) has found it necessary to introduce this legislation in response to stress related claims rising in cost by more than 54 per cent, to $37 million, during the three years to 1994-95. Despite the speeches made by those opposite, I suspect that, had the election result been different in March last year, we would have seen the Labor Party bring in amendments similar to those currently before the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes will also make sure that we as a Commonwealth pay out claims only where there is a very real connection between the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stress and the injury. I would be surprised if very many people would differ with the principle that there ought to be a very strong connection. Some of the cases which we have heard about where people have been successful in claiming against the Commonwealth I believe are totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be recognised that the amendments proposed in part 1 of schedule 2 to the bill, to clarify the circumstances in which Commonwealth employees are entitled to receive compensation pursuant to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act will achieve a number of things. They will restore the original intent of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, which has been distorted by decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court, and in doing so place direct responsibility on Commonwealth employers to manage occupational stress strategically and in a manner consistent with other public sector jurisdictions in Australia, noting that the reputation of the Australian Public Service has been damaged by a public perception that compensation for stress is too readily available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will also ensure the continued financial viability of the scheme by ensuring that it is not jeopardised by the payment of compensation for diseases which have little or no connection with employment or stress which arises solely from reasonable managerial or administrative action and reduce litigiousness in dealing with claims by Commonwealth public servants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really ought to be recognised that there has been an enormous increase in the number of stress claims, with a great boost in cost to the Australian taxpayer. It also ought to be recognised that people have been able to claim for income support in circumstances where most people would see that that claim ought not be made. I have heard of instances where an employee was involved in an affair at work. When the affair ended, she found that she was unable to remain in the workplace and lodged a claim for stress. The cost to the Commonwealth to date is $80,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another case an employee was requested to attend a counselling session to discuss his work performance. Surely that is a very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6415"> reasonable action by a manager within the Commonwealth Public Service. But this employee found that coming counselling session to be stressful. He went on sick leave, lodged a compensation claim for stress and this employee, would you believe it, has been absent from work since mid-1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another case an employee claimed a work&hyphen;related stress condition due to disputes with his employer. The disputes related to the payment of higher duties and the fact that his agency refused to provide him with a permanent position. Obviously, he would be miffed over the fact that he could not get extra money and he was not promoted. A lot of people in politics might well be miffed over the fact that their talent has not always been recognised, but I do not think anyone believes that politicians should take stress leave. This Commonwealth public servant certainly did exactly that. The cost to the Commonwealth to date has been over $192,000. That really sets out very clearly the rationale for the substantive amendments currently before the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, we find that the Labor Party is being hypocritical now that they are out of government. They have lost what little attitude towards financial responsibility they might have had. They feel able to come in here and say exactly the opposite of what they would have said had they been successful at the election in March last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Namadgi obviously feels very strongly over the impact that the government's economic reforms have had on the Australian Capital Territory and on the area that she represents. Unfortunately, it is interesting that her views are not reflected in the views expressed by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. The honourable member for Namadgi suggests that the government ought not be taking the course of action that it is taking in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would perhaps clarify the matter for those listening to indicate what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> felt when it wrote an article on the complex environment surrounding workers compensation. The article pointed out the grave situation confronting Australia with respect to workers compensation. It points out the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> situation confronting the government and it points out that Comcare has a rather complicated duty. It includes evidence why the Commonwealth has had to take action through this particular bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in an editorial dated Friday, 13 December 1996 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> did come forward and support very strongly what the government was doing. In an editorial headed `Government right to act on stress', the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> broadly endorsed the approach of the government:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There seems little question that the Australian Public Service has been a stressful place in which to work since the Howard Government began implementing its changes and efficiencies in about April and May this year. Many jobs have gone and many remain in question.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It highlights the fact that there is stress in relation to the economic changes which this government has found it necessary to make because of the economic circumstances we inherited upon attaining government. The editorial goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is, indeed, changing the rules related to stress-related workers' compensation. It is not denying public servants access to such arrangements but it is placing a greater onus on Commonwealth employees to prove that their affliction was genuinely caused by problems in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not know what person who considers himself or herself to be a reasonable citizen could possibly differ from the determination of the government to place a greater onus on Commonwealth employees to prove that their affliction was genuinely caused by problems in the workplace. Going on, the editorial says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government felt itself compelled to act on the issue because Commonwealth employees had had to do no more than claim their work had contributed to their stress to be capable of mounting a successful claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem with stress in the workplace is that it has become a catch-all complaint. If someone is experiencing problems at home, is not coping with their job, or is part of a turbulent emotional relationship, they can claim to be feeling "stressed". In circumstances in which those people have claimed workers' compensation it has been difficult for the Commonwealth to prove work had not also been a contributing factor. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6416">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  could well have written the minister's approach in this matter. The minister has argued forcefully the reasons that change is necessary. In the parliament, the honourable member for Namadgi condemns the government for what we are doing; yet we find that an editorial of her own local newspaper on Friday, 13 December 1996 is coming out and supporting the approach of the government.</PARA>

He should be supporting what this government is doing because I believe that, had the Labor Party been returned in March last year, the former minister and his government could well have introduced this bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Again, I think the Labor Party will stand condemned. Now that they are out of office they have absolutely no sense of economic responsibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As other contributors to this debate have indicated, the essential changes within the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 are as follows: an amendment to the definition of `disease' so that there should be a `significant degree' of contribution by the employee as opposed to a `material degree'; an amendment to the definition of `injury' so that, in general, work related stress claims cannot be pursued if they arise predominantly out of reasonable managerial or administrative action; and the transfer of responsibility from the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees to Comcare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The thrust of my contribution would be to say, in a  similar manner to which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of this country has often commented about Sir Winston Churchill on comments that he might have made about racial matters decades ago, that everything should be seen in its context. Equally, this parliament was treated to debates between the previous member for Wills and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) about Frank Anstey, a former member of this House, and comments he had made about the Jewish population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am trying to make is that everything should be seen in a wider context. The claim by this government that this is essentially about getting rid of a few shonks&mdash;I should not say `a few'; the thrust of a few comments from those opposite today has been that we have a massive avalanche of problems in this area&mdash;has to be seen in a wider context. The government seem to be making the same allegation in the veterans' affairs area. They say here today that these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6417"> changes are not about budgetary considerations; they have been brought about because of all the problems that have been detected. Yet we find simultaneously&mdash;in a totally different circumstance to that of Vietnam veterans&mdash;a similar attack upon people's rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that, in the last budget, the government has attempted to alter the guidelines and the rules on post-traumatic stress syndrome. This would not seem to be a genuine analysis of a problem and an attempt to tackle it; it would seem to be part of a wider agenda&mdash;an agenda which, when they first came into government, saw massive cuts to occupational health and safety; an agenda which sees them in a parallel department, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, not only severely cutting down on employment by 610 people out of 3,400 but also looking at cuts&mdash;if their statements are correct in estimates of 12 June&mdash;of 30 per cent over three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a broader context of what this government is doing we are seeing, firstly, attacks in a totally different area in regard to people's rights relating to injuries, and I am talking about veterans who have fought for this country; secondly, in a very big fashion, cuts to the Public Service work force, which understandably will have a tremendous impact on the stress people face in the work force; thirdly, a very swift and direct attack on the basic support structure of occupational health and safety; and, finally, on a broader scale and broader front, changes in the Australian work force which will substantially increase stress and injuries. The government is basically trying to undermine people's rights in the employment place and to erode the unions' say in the industrial relations process. One government member, the member for Bowman (Mrs West) from recollection, dared to get to a core problem. Many of these claims are a form of revolt against the problems in the workplace. People have substantially lost the use of the union movement to fight their cases, and their only form of revolt, their only form of resistance, of getting a point across to management, is by these kinds of reactions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I will briefly talk about a number of these parallel processes. In regard to Vietnam veterans, we have seen the government go around and start telling those organisations&mdash;not just Vietnam veterans but other veteran groups as well; but they are the most prevalent because of their particular war circumstance&mdash;that there is going to be a five per cent cut in the people that receive pensions because of their injuries. Quite clearly, they are already detailing a percentage outcome, a monetary gain for this government and what they are essentially about. That is despite the fact that, over a period, the agent orange inquiry and a variety of other government instigated inquiries, not veteran instigated inquiries, have said that the level of post-traumatic stress syndrome that we are getting is about what you would expect. Despite the fact that all these government reports have said that this is what you are going to get, the government are now saying it is too high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, we have seen an avalanche of personalised claims made by ministers opposite. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> of 23 June has an article headed `$80,000 for love tangle'. This is, of course, the instigated leaking process by this government to essentially identify a few people. Those people are going to be known where they work, they are going to be known by their families and they are going to be known by the people they live with. There has been no proper detailing of the more specific details of their circumstance, just broad generalities about their case. This is not peculiar to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). We have had the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) in regard to the Black Hawk incident itemising one person's individual compensation situation&mdash;a very great abandonment of tradition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a minimal number of, let us say, more scandalous&hyphen;sounding instances of abuse in the system. From those few itemised cases&mdash;which are unexplained, undetailed and non&hyphen;specific&mdash;we jump, as we have seen in many of the contributions today, to an allegation that it is widespread, that it is all over the place and that it is a massive problem. The member for Bowman, the member for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6418"> Capricornia (Mr Marek) and a number of other speakers opposite have itemised statistics: the cost of stress claims compared with others and the average duration of claims, et cetera, without precise analysis of the reasons and the changes that are occurring in the Australian workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very soon after the last election, we had a very thorough attack by this government on occupational health and safety matters in the country. It is interesting to note these leading questions asked of the minister in the journal called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Safety News</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is your position on the introduction of tougher penalties for industry in breach of occupational health and safety laws and regulations? Do you think tougher fines would equal fewer workplace deaths and injuries?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To paraphrase, his comment was not that there would be any great activity on this front and any great rushing of legislation into parliament to do something about penalties for employers and actually tackling the problem; his actual comment was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government will give consideration to these issues in determining its response to the Industry Commission report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So that refusal to get on the ball game and do anything about the number of deaths in this country relating to OH&amp;S issues&mdash;which from recollection are about 600 a year&mdash;has not been accompanied by any attempt to do anything about the broader question of policing the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the Liberal and National parties come in here today and say their essential thrust is not about decreasing costs and not about essentially undermining workers compensation, they say that their thrust is supposedly about the fraud and the tricksters in the field. But let us look at their track record, let us look at their credentials and let us look at their honesty and their sincerity in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very soon after coming into government, one of their first actions&mdash;they were in the door for five minutes, and if they had a priority they certainly showed it on this one&mdash;was to seek to undermine progress in regard to uniform national standards and the collection of national occupational health and safety statistics. They did this despite the fact that an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> estimated 650,000 workers suffer from diseases and injuries in this country and an estimated 2,700 workers die each year from work&hyphen;related causes&mdash;500 of them in accidents and 2,200 from diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, that was their great consideration five minutes after coming into government. Months later, they have done nothing to police the industry nor to do anything about penalties. Conservative estimates from a variety of sources, which are not necessarily from our side of politics, are that the cost of occupational health and safety problems in this country&mdash;the cost of a failure to police, a failure to have national standards and a failure to have proper statistics&mdash;is estimated to be about $20 billion without taking into consideration pain and suffering. It is also estimated that only a 10 per cent reduction in injuries would lead to an improvement in our gross domestic product of $340 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is interesting to note that the expenditure on trying to avoid this problem is some $2,000 per dead worker a year; that is, for each worker who dies in this country, we spend only $2,300 in trying to avoid that death occurring. It is also interesting to note what Fran Cavanagh said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 3 September last year after she launched a group called Advocates for Workplace Safety. I had the pleasure of meeting her and discussing some of these issues with her last year. Her activity stemmed from her daughter's death at Sydney University when structural problems on a work activity led to her daughter, an innocent bystander, being killed. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> she has also detailed the estimate that there are 84 deaths for every million workers in this country, compared with a US rate, believe it or not, of only 37 deaths per million workers, 24 in the UK and 22 in Sweden. So there is something fundamentally wrong in regard to occupational health and safety in this country and the lack of effort going into it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Very soon after coming into government, there was a very strong determination by this government to put into operation the commitment given by Peter Costello on 15 February 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6419"> 1996 in a document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS>. He noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outlays to NOHSC will be reduced by $5.9 million. Savings will be achieved from across the board reductions in corporate services, industry development, national uniformity standards and national co&hyphen;ordination. Efficiencies were identified in a very critical report by the Industry Commission into Occupational Health and Safety.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In a very selective list of quotations, Mr Costello said it found that more can be done to reduce the scope of administrative overlap by:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> clarifying and streamlining agency responsibilities;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> combining service, research and advisory functions; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> rationalising legislation to simplify administration and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">compliance.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that was a cover for the essential point which was a reduction by $6 million in the effort by the government, taxpayers and the people of this country to reduce the cost of our gross domestic product and productivity and, more particularly, in regard to the personal circumstances of the individuals who are affected and who die. That commitment by Mr Costello was one of the more prompt and efficient gestures in the first weeks of government. They had many things to accomplish after being out of office for 13 years, but they were not letting any grass grow under their feet when it came to slashing back occupational health and protection. Mr Costello said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part of the $5.9 million in savings will be achieved by scaling back training grants which in 1995-96 amounted to $1.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the thrust of this incoming government. For all of the attempts by those opposite to decry and attack the performance of this side of politics on this matter, it is interesting to note the contrasting reality in New South Wales on the part of that government. The New South Wales industrial relations minister, Mr Jeff Shaw, appeared in court earlier in 1996 to argue for the nation's highest safety fine when Thiess Constructions was fined $175,000 over the deaths in 1991 and 1992 of two workers during the upgrade of the Burrinjuck Dam at Yass. Thiess had a record nine 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> breaches on the site between July 1992 and April 1994, each incurring a $500 on the spot fine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do know of course that the government in New South Wales&mdash;in contrast to the regime here&mdash;has not attempted to go backwards and give industry free rein to stop collecting industry specific statistics, which anyone with half a brain would realise have some value in this country. They have not been going in that direction. In contrast with the federal government, in 1991 in Victoria and under Carr in New South Wales, the penalties for offences under the act have been increased. In New South Wales under the occupational health and safety provisions the fine has increased from $250,000 to $500,000 and the courts have been given the discretion to gaol negligent employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am inclined to disagree with the rhetoric that says that this is essentially about trying to get rid of the extreme cases that we have heard about. No-one disputes that there are people who are photographed&mdash;as one of the government speakers said&mdash;playing golf, running around a football ground or gardening in the front yard. There is no doubt that happens. But to try to lift the requirement in order possibly to undermine the ability of a far broader range of workers to lay claims is not justified by the citation&mdash;as has occurred over the last few weeks&mdash;of a few individual cases that obviously, to the mass of Australians, sound very extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the context in which they try to justify these kinds of provisions. One of the members opposite said that the world is getting faster, stress is part of life and that is, really, just bad luck. That would be all very interesting if there were not the very material contribution of the stress of the on&hyphen;site, day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day working circumstances&mdash;and the stress outside of work&mdash;that is taken into the home. As we have said, there has been a very significant change in the workplace in this country and in people's attitudes to their experiences at work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will refer to a survey. Lo and behold, even in the period of the Labor government, in 1995, there was a survey of enterprise bargaining in Australia which covered a broad 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6420"> spectrum of workers. They were not trade union delegates from around the country: this was just an independent survey of people in the workplace in this country. It indicated that, in the case of 58 per cent of them, there had been a noticeable increase in effort in the workplace over the previous 12 months; only 36 per cent thought there had been no change. In regard to stress, 50 per cent of them estimated a noticeable increase in stress in their workplace. The pace of doing work had risen in the case of 46 per cent of them. There had been a similar intensification across all workplace types and it was said in that survey that there was a correlation between a high score on the index of work intensification and an employee reporting a decline in satisfaction with the balance between work and family life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no excuse for saying that many of those stress situations are independent, autonomous and not connected with work. We are seeing in this country essential changes in work practices, many of which are going in the direction of causing increased occupational health and safety problems, increased stress problems and increased difficulty in deciding what should be catered for by the workers compensation system. This change simultaneously increases pressure on people, ensures that there is going to be more stress in the workplace and erodes people's rights to compensation and it is indeed a national disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that this bill deals, essentially, with the Public Service. Of course, what is happening there is paralleled in different ways throughout industry in this country. We have a monumental change in the work force, that is, the requirement that far fewer people in the Australian Public Service do the jobs that were previously done by many. There are constant claims by the government that it will reshuffle, alter people's industrial relations rights and put the clamps on the Public Service in this country, push them around and pull them into line. There are constant changes. There are threats of privatisation and outsourcing. People are trying to say that all of this will not contribute to stress and that it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will have no effect. That is absolutely ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the wider society there are developments such as the use of private contractors, people going on to sites which they are unaware of and people not knowing the equipment or the work practices on the site. All of these things are contributing to workers compensation problems.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill contains amendments announced in the 1996 budget to clarify the circumstances in which compensation is payable through the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme. I would presume that it really is relevant to Commonwealth workers, rather than to the broader work force right across Australia. I will confine my comments to that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends two acts, the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. The government fully supports access to workers compensation where there is a genuine work related injury or disease. However, the intent of this bill is simply to ensure that there is a significant link between work and the injury or disease before there is an entitlement to compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think that any Australian would argue with that. That is a reasonable concept. It is the concept of workers compensation that probably the majority of workers across Australia have; that an injury sustained at work is compensable and injuries sustained not in a work related area should not be compensable by the employer or their compensation company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as this legislation is concerned, the government has a three&hyphen;pronged strategy on occupational stress in particular. First of all, prevention. Through various projects run by Comcare in conjunction with Commonwealth agencies, the government wants to actively promote better control or prevention of stress in the Public Service. Secondly, improved claims management and the establishment of a separate stress claims management centre have achieved positive results so far. That is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6421"> an area that the government wants to pursue. Thirdly, there is the appropriate legislative framework, which is what we are debating today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of these amendments is to fix Labor's legislation. The legislation currently defines `disease' as an ailment to which a person's employment contributed in a material degree. That is the point of discussion: `material degree'. The onus is on the claimant to demonstrate that the employment was more than just a mere contributing factor to their disease. However, courts have ruled that the word `material' does not require employment to be a significant contributing factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are any number of examples and I am not going to rattle off all of them. I have a couple that would be worth while relating to the House. For example, an employee claimed that work related stress aggravated a pre-existing knee injury. He underwent rehabilitation and was given modified duties. These duties required him to travel so he claimed the cost of adding a side car to his motorbike to make it easier to ride. The cost to date is over $166,000. A  second example is of an employee who claimed for stress as the result of what she perceived to be an inappropriate comment made in the workplace. The comment was made to the whole work group, but the individual said she found it personally offensive. Strangely enough, she lodged her claim only when she was interviewed in relation to poor performance. The cost of this claim is approximately $190,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody would undermine the fact that there are very genuine claims in the workplace and very genuine stress related claims in the workplace. Anybody who views this legislation in a reasonable manner would realise that it will accommodate that. I go back to the simple ethic, that the work force in Australia perceive that, if an injury is sustained in the workplace, it should be compensable. If it is not, it should not be compensable and the employer should not be liable for compensation as far as an injury that is sustained outside of the workplace is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition know full well that the scheme they set up when they were in government was never meant to compensate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people for injuries which are not work related. Yet the ALP are prepared to allow the scheme to continue to blow out at taxpayers' expense, rather than get offside with their union mates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to compensation costs, in a joint submission to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, the Department of Industrial Relations and Comcare stated that the Commonwealth's liabilities as at 30 June 1996 totalled $1.23 billion. That is an enormous amount of money in the current economic climate. That is a liability for the taxpayers of Australia. Despite a decrease in the number of claims, an increase in both the complexity and duration of claims is leading to higher program costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Occupational stress claims are generally high cost claims. Current figures in relation to stress claims are very interesting. Occupational stress claims are generally high cost claims. While the number of accepted claims is dropping, the costs associated with these claims remain high. The annual cost of stress claims has risen from $24 million in 1991-92 to an estimated $35.7 million for the 1996-97 financial year. To date in 1996-97 stress claims represent five per cent of the accepted claims, but account for 18 per cent of the costs. The average cost of a stress claim is $32,000&hyphen;odd compared with $7,700 for other claims. In other words, stress claims cost the taxpayer more than four times as much as other types of claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This comes back to the point I made earlier about the way the courts have ruled on the interpretation of the `material' factor. Courts have ruled that the word `material' does not require employment to be a significant contributing factor. We have to address the situation as far as stress claims are concerned. Stress claims are also of longer duration. After 12 months, 15 per cent of those with stress claims are still off work, compared to four per cent of employees with other claims. I have had first hand experience with a couple of constituents in my electorate in this exact circumstance. It is an area that the government is very keen to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We welcome the signs that stress claim rates are falling, but we do not know how sustainable this downward trend is without 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6422"> these amendments. We do not want to risk a blow&hyphen;out in liability to the Commonwealth and the taxpayer by continuing to pay compensation in circumstances it was not intended for. It is an entirely reasonable argument to put that compensation claims should be directly related to an accident that has taken place in the workplace and not in a related area. That is a reasonable concept and that is all the government is arguing for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This amending legislation has a three-pronged strategy for dealing with occupational stress. The first one is prevention, the second is improved claims management and the third is the appropriate legislative framework which we are debating today. The workers compensation scheme was never intended to be used as a grievance system. Lodging a claim is not a remedy if a person is aggrieved about a reasonable management action or not getting along with a colleague. The bulk of evidence presented to the committee related to proposed changes to the legal testing linking injury or disease with employment. These proposed changes to the definition of `disease' are designed to strengthen the connection between work and compensatable injury.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My business structure is made up of a number of companies and private interests. My brother is involved jointly with me in Prosser Automotive Engineers Pty Ltd, Prosser Management Pty Ltd and Hornell Nominees Pty Ltd. I hold a share in trust for my brother in Prosser Homes Pty Ltd and, likewise, he holds a share in trust for me in my company Regional Property Investments Pty Ltd. Regional Property Investments was previously known as Prosser Engineering Pty Ltd, the business that was my steel fabrication and construction business. The operating part of that business was sold in October 1993 when I made the decision to sell because it was apparent that it would be very difficult to run a construction business without my personal involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My brother owns his own building and joinery business, which he operates as R&amp;M Prosser and Son. I own a number of properties in my own name in Bunbury, including three residential properties and a number of commercial and light industrial rental units.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Operations of the firm</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The operating business now comprise Prosser Automotive Engineers Pty Ltd, involved in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6423"> engine reconditioning and fuel retailing and property ownership and investment. It is Prosser Automotive Engineers that owns the substantial bulk of the group's property holdings. The company owns, among other sites, the Eaton lot, the Bunbury Homemaker Centre, the Minninup Forum shopping centre, a small neighbourhood style shopping centre, and Leschenault Quays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the early 1990s Mr Wood has been the manager of all of the above companies and also handles my personal affairs. I am a director of the above companies. The other director is my brother, Steven Prosser. Mr Wood, together with my brother, handles the daily affairs of all of the above companies. In addition, Mr Wood handles my personal affairs. My brother and Colin Wood have told me that a lot of general correspondence to the company is still, in fact, addressed to me personally, even though the matters are specifically dealt with by my brother and Mr Wood and I have no involvement at all. I have previously asked Mr Wood to have these addresses corrected.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My involvement</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The company holds quarterly board meetings of the group, attended by Mr Wood, my brother, myself, and the company secretary, Mr Eastman. I would generally meet with my brother around once each fortnight when I am home on a Saturday morning at his company's joinery workshop, a business in which I have no involvement. These Saturday morning visits are normally in the company of my children because he often has his children with him, and we will discuss events of a general nature occurring in the previous fortnight. My brother occasionally calls at my home with his family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would speak with my manager Colin Wood either by telephone or in person once weekly, not on a daily basis. The reason for the degree of frequency is that he also handles my personal affairs, including matters such as car and house insurance and other personal payment matters. The daily decisions of the group, including the daily decisions of my private holdings, are made by Mr Wood and my brother.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the town that I live in, being the City of Bunbury, there is no doubt that I have a very high profile. I have lived in the town all of my life, have run businesses in the town since a very young age, spent six years on the Bunbury City Council, stood for mayor in 1985 in a very high profile, hard fought mayoral campaign and now as the federal member. Both sides of my family were long-term residents in Bunbury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any political, community or social function within the greater Bunbury area business and local politics are discussed to a far greater degree than politics in general. Indeed, it would be fair to say that politics does not really rate highly in the area in which I live so naturally, at any function I attend, business and local political matters on a range of subjects are discussed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the period since I became minister I have had a number of discussions at different times with councillors of the Bunbury City Council. These cover the full range of local government activities and occur primarily in my capacity as the federal member for Forrest. Specific meetings or contacts that I can recall since becoming minister are: in February or March of 1997 I contacted John McCourt, a Bunbury city councillor. Mr McCourt was a high profile Bunbury city councillor, generally thought to have Labor Party leanings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I called Mr McCourt about the proposed council roadworks in the street in which I live which the council had been planning for a number of years. I asked him what progress council was making, expressing a concern that if council were expecting to commence the works in winter, given the high water table in the area, there was the potential to turn the street into a quagmire. Mr McCourt said he would look into the matter and get back to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My recollection is that I did raise with him the coming mayoral campaign. I asked Mr McCourt in passing what sort of reaction there would be to any proposal to put a bulk goods, no frills style supermarket on the Homemaker Centre site. As I recall, he indicated that the company should put up a proposal and test the council's reaction. The company subsequently did submit a proposal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6424"> to the council and the proposal was rejected by the council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had contacts with a number of Bunbury city councillors since becoming a minister. The councillors include Councillors Nicholson, Eglington, Jeffrey, Comito and on one occasion, at a social function, Councillor Major. I have on different occasions discussed with some of these councillors council's proposed drainage works behind a property in Denning Road that I own in my own name. I have also at different times had discussions with councillors mentioned above in regard to potential parking and traffic problems relating to the proposed shopping centre development in the central business district.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two of the councillors, I recall, rang me asking what the scheme, planning scheme No. 6, parking requirements are in the central business district of Bunbury. It is widely known that I have a strong knowledge and understanding of the City of Bunbury town plan No. 6. Indeed, the scheme was introduced when I was a city councillor and it should be noted that I spent my entire time on council on the planning committee. I am often asked my view in regard to planning matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the period I have been the federal member for Forrest, I have had business people seek my views on their own personal planning matters and at times seek a view as to what I think a particular property that they or their clients are interested in may be worth. On a wide range of issues that affect my constituents and may affect me personally and/or my companies in general I may have made representations to state and federal ministers on behalf of constituents. In my view, all of these contacts are consistent with me fulfilling my duties as a local member and do not in any way conflict with the guidelines for ministerial conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My other occasional contact with business people includes dealings with a local structural engineer relating to design matters, specifically the design of a small dam for a small farming property that I have recently acquired for my family on the outskirts of Bunbury, and discussions with a bulldozing contractor about putting that dam in.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While a minister, I have made no formal presentations or submissions to the Dardanup Shire Council. The only planning approval applied for by the group was for the Eaton development and that was approved on 6 February 1996, prior to my becoming a minister. The only council staff or executives that I have met with since becoming a minister involved the odd call from the shire president, Councillor Bennett. I can recall Councillor Bennett called me two or three times over the last 14 months. In addition, I was present when Mr Wood, my brother, Councillor Bennett and Shire Clerk Sprague viewed the Eaton development proposal drawings in the architect's office&mdash;Mr Nicholson. This, I recall, was on a Saturday morning in late November or December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At any time that I was contacted by Councillor Bennett I advised him that he should write to my brother on any matter raised. Since March last year there may have been an occasional telephone call from the then Shire Clerk, Mr Sprague. To my recollection I was introduced to Mr Chester, the new shire clerk for Dardanup, by Councillor Robert Nicholson in his office. This was not a formal meeting; however, the development proposal at Eaton, previously approved by his council in February 1996, was mentioned, but not in any great detail. Also mentioned at this meeting was council's desire to swap a portion of land belonging to the company, to which I responded that he should write to my brother in regard to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received a deputation from the Harvey Shire Council. This deputation met in my electorate office and did not inform me prior to their meeting the purpose of the meeting. I learned at the meeting that the deputation was seeking company donations for a swimming pool project. I pointed out that at the time the company group had previously made a donation towards the Bunbury Entertainment Centre and that from the company's point of view the focus was in Bunbury, not Harvey. I told them they should submit a formal presentation to Mr Wood or Steve Prosser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to business matters, I have not had any meeting with the current state 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6425"> minister for planning or any person from his department since becoming minister. I had one discussion with the previous planning minister, the Hon. Richard Lewis, at a social function in Busselton. I did not instigate the discussion. The then minister Lewis asked me if I was involved in a zoning presentation that he had received from my brother and other business colleagues, to which I replied: `Yes.' There was no further discussion on this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already advised the House in relation to the call I made to Mr Nick Greiner of Coles Myer Ltd. I again confirm that I had one discussion with Mr Greiner concerning the Eaton lot. In that call I requested a contact point for my brother relating to a proposed Target store. Mr Greiner advised me that I should get my brother to write to him. Mr Greiner and I did not discuss any detail nor any other matter, including car parking arrangements. I also confirm that I have had no further contact with Mr Greiner and there are no commercial arrangements between Coles Myer and any company with which I am associated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I specifically do recall that a local real estate agent, Mr Terry Coote, made an appointment to see me within the last two months. I was unaware of the reason for this appointment. Mr Coote offered for sale a property across the road to the company's Homemaker site. Mr Coote advised that the property carried the same zoning as the company's Homemaker site. I said to him that, as far as I was aware from the information distributed to every householder by the council area, the zoning under the council's new scheme would not be consistent with the company's Homemaker site and that, in any event, the company would probably not be interested in purchasing the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to other contacts, I can recall in 1996 that I met on one or possibly two occasions with the planners who were drawing up a planning concept for the Eaton development and with planners with regard to land I own in my own name in King Road and I viewed the presentation they were making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1997, I held a discussion with planners Thompson McRobert and Associates in regard 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to a planning proposal for a bulk goods, no frills style supermarket on vacant land on the Homemaker site. This was some time after I had spoken to Councillor John McCourt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On two occasions, in company with Mr D. Van Noort, the civil engineer employed by the group for the Eaton development, I inspected the site works at the Eaton development. The first was some time in February 1997. The second was on a Saturday morning in March 1997 when he picked me up from my home to take me out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In setting out the detail that I have, I am convinced that I have not, in any way, engaged in the daily work of the family business. The outline of my corporate structure clearly shows that I am not involved in the daily work of the family business. Clearly, these investments and business interests are family business interests. None of these family businesses have ever conflicted or are likely to conflict with my public duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I categorically reject any allegation that, at any time, I have used my ministerial position for personal gain and, clearly, there is not one shred of evidence to support such an allegation. I clearly do not have control of the daily activities of my companies and reject any attempt to distort or categorise any of the instances as constituting being involved in the daily work of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a company director of my family companies, I do have a duty to have an overall view of the companies' activities and I do attend quarterly board meetings to fulfil those duties and obligations. The performance of that duty does not conflict with any element of the ministerial guidelines. I believe that the business arrangements that I had in place prior to becoming a minister and since becoming a minister are within the letter and the spirit of the ministerial guidelines.</PARA>

That is not what you, Councillor Nicholson, or any of the other people who backed you, wanted. Nevertheless, that is what occurred; hence you do not have any ongoing arrangements with Coles Myer. That was nothing to do with your best efforts in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You go from that point to talk about your range of social contacts. I think I detected throughout those particular discussions on&hyphen;site inspections involving planning authorities related to your business interests. You have to be the ultimate weasel worder to take from the answers that you gave us that you had no relationship with any formal presentation. What definition of `formal presentation' do we now have? Unless you appear in a dinner suit and bow tie, it is not a formal presentation? I would have thought that appearing on a site as you appeared on those sites with the people directly responsible for the planning authorities was exactly the sort of formal presentation to which we were referring. It is the ultimate in weasel wordery to try to claim that the sorts of answers that you have given in this place conformed with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you went through your lengthy exercise of the potential areas in which you may have stood in breach of the code of ministerial conduct, you neglected misleading this House and misleading the people of this country, Mr Prosser. Contrast your particular statement in here today of your business interests with that paltry set of declarations that appears in the parliamentary declarations. That 20&hyphen;minute speech of yours appears as `Bunbury&mdash;various lots'. Three words can describe, as far as you are concerned, that enormous layer of business interests&mdash;a description of what you were up to in that period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And then you go beyond that and speak to councillors who are actively engaged in committee processes that are associated with decisions at any point of time. You say that it is a sufficient defence that from time to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time you speak with them socially. That is not in fact a sufficient defence in any standard of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are actually thinking of this in another context&mdash;say, a minister having business relationships of a potentially corrupt variety, for argument's sake&mdash;if an exchange of views occurs at a particular cocktail party that this and that ought to be done, is the mere fact that it was not a formal sit&hyphen;down notified by the secretary of your company somehow or other supposed to excuse it? Is that somehow or other supposed to clear you&mdash;that long, detailed discussions at so&hyphen;called social gatherings with people who are in your planning authorities, with people with whom you have very considerable influence, somehow do not involve the daily work of the process?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to get back into the heart of this&mdash;which you have not denied in the various proposals that you have gone through: the activation, via your ministerial portfolio, with Coles interests centrally. What you are actually talking about, by and large, as you offend against the daily work provisions associated in that code of conduct, what you are actually dealing with in normal circumstances, is Coles region. Decisions about car parking arrangements and even the location of particular Target stores or other Coles stores is generally handled by Coles region. It is not a matter that would be normally handled by the central office of Coles. What you did as a minister, to bring into play for the advantage of your companies, was to take Coles centre out and stick it in the region to make absolutely certain that your views got across in that particular process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is how ministerial influence is used. You do not actually have to come out and have a piece of paper saying, `I, the minister for small business affairs, accordingly request you, Nick Greiner, to intervene formally in these decision making processes inside the affairs of the town of Bunbury to ensure that my position is advantaged and, therefore, at some point in time down the line, you can expect a quid pro quo.' Unless there is some sort of letter that is an open confession, you seem to think that nothing matters at all in

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have actually seen reports that the Howard government places too much emphasis on the family. This is one of the charges to which we plead guilty. The charge is made by the Australian Labor Party. What has been referred to me by one of our members is a letter to the Frankston <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent</EMPHASIS>  on 24 June 1997. It was a letter of complaint about the government and it finished off by saying this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is time that the Howard Government, which placed too much emphasis on the family during the Federal election campaign, honoured its pre&hyphen;election promises.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The writer of this letter in the Frankston <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent</EMPHASIS>  was Greg Wilton, the MHR for Isaacs. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6429">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the coalition is accused by the Labor Party of putting too much emphasis on the family. We say `guilty'. Yes, we are very guilty of putting too much emphasis on the family. Conversely, you are not guilty of putting emphasis on the family. We would like to clear you of any interest in Australian families at all, and we know why you are complaining&mdash;because of our interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go through how the Howard government places emphasis on the family. From 1 July 1997 families will be getting $450 to contribute to the cost of taking private health insurance. The Labor Party never placed an emphasis on the family like that. On 1 January the family tax initiative  could give a qualifying family with two children a reduction of $34 per fortnight in their tax. The Labor Party never placed emphasis on the family like that. For self&hyphen;funded retirees, from 1 July we will be giving them the same rebates on their taxation as applies to pensioner couples. The Labor Party never placed an emphasis on families like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 1 July there will also be other very important initiatives for individuals in Australia. People will have the option to put money into retirement savings accounts rather than being forced into union operated superannuation funds. There will be an 18 per cent income tax rebate for  contributions up to $3,000 to the superannuation fund or retirement savings account of a non&hyphen;income earning spouse to allow people to make contributions on behalf of their spouse into the concessionally taxed superannuation regime. That is designed to help families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I also remind the House that on 1 July this year those measures which will help small businesses will come into effect with capital gains tax rollover relief to give small businesses the opportunity, without the penalty of the intervention of capital gains tax, to roll over business and assets to enjoy the kind of growth that small business in this country wants to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party levels many, many false charges at this coalition government, but that was one that was true. This is a government that places emphasis on the family and this is a government that is very proud to do so.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was fond of quoting a Professor Weatherley of the United States who was brought out here, as he said, as `an acknowledged expert on social security systems.' On 30 August 1995, the minister, as he then was, said that Professor Weatherley's `conclusion as of 1993 was that the integrity of the system had been, as a result of government actions, essentially repaired.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Sydney was fond of rebuking me, because, after he had produced a report on one occasion about the government's performance, I had suggested that his comments failed to acknowledge that what he was discovering through his efforts in relation to fraud was only touching the tip of an iceberg. He was quick to respond that I had little idea about what the then government was doing. It is very interesting that after the last election the Labor Party undertook a review of why they had lost. One of the comments in that report was that it seemed everybody knew of a welfare cheat. That was offered as one of the reasons the Labor Party had lost so significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, when the coalition came into government, it announced that it would report quarterly to parliament on the progress that had been achieved in dealing with these issues. In the last report to parliament, the minister was able to announce that our efforts in the previous six months had saved around $12 million each week and that over 90,000 people who should not have been on a benefit had been taken off. I can now inform the House that, as was disclosed yesterday in the latest report, we have further advances in the implementation of the government's measures dealing with fraud. After nine months, nearly 138,000 people have been removed from payments altogether and 65,500 have had their payments reduced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question in relation to employment and I note the interest that is shown in employment by members on this side of the House. You get questions on job vacancies, which you do not get from the Australian Labor Party. This side of the House is interested in the substantive issues of employment and families&mdash;even if it is said that we place too much emphasis on families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members on this side of the House will be pleased to know that ABS job vacancies rose by 2.7 per cent in the June quarter in seasonally-adjusted terms and by 1.4 per cent in trend terms. Total job vacancies are now at their highest level since the December quarter of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private sector vacancies are at their second highest level ever&mdash;the highest level being recorded in the December quarter of 1994. Today's rise in the seasonally adjusted  measure of vacancies was as a result of a 5.8 per cent increase in the number of private sector vacancies, offset in part by a 12.4 per cent fall in the smaller public sector job vacancy series. Private sector vacancies of around 54,900 are at their highest level since 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the December quarter of 1994, when they were 55,500. The level of private sector job vacancies in the June quarter of 1997 is the second highest reading in the history of the series which began in the June quarter of 1979.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the reports for overtime, while overtime fell 1.4 per cent in seasonally-adjusted terms, it rose 1.5 per cent in trend terms, reflecting the strong growth in the March quarter. The ABS job vacancies data taken together with the ANZ job vacancies series is supportive of a strengthening in employment and employment prospects over the coming months. It is particularly good to see the strength of private sector vacancies, which are strong in historical terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope all members of the House&mdash;just like, I am sure, members on this side&mdash;will welcome the fact that job opportunities are growing, that vacancies are expanding and that there are good prospects in relation to employment over the forthcoming months. We will continue to take those policy measures which will be supportive of growing employment in the Australian economy&mdash;measures to take pressure off interest rates, measures to reduce Commonwealth debt, measures to put the budget into surplus, measures to improve industrial relations and measures to reduce the burden of capital gains taxation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I know it is of great importance to him and to the people of his electorate, an area that sees a lot of economic activity centring on the use of such things as fossil fuel energy. The government's fundamental principle in this whole debate is one of balance, a balance between economic development and environmental sustainability. If you do not get that balance globally, you will get what we have had here nationally in Australia: gridlock, a gridlock of the sort that we saw under Labor's forest policy where no-one benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the greenhouse area, again, we are pursuing a balanced policy approach. We want to achieve effective, equitable and practical arrangements which ensure a balanced economic and environmental outcome. If we do not achieve that internationally, all our efforts will fail because rigid, undifferentiated targets where adjustment burdens are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not equitable will simply not prove sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get down to some of the facts in this, Australia produces just 1.4 per cent of global emissions, relatively high, as it happens, per capita, but that is largely because we have in this country a comparative advantage in fossil fuels. That advantage has allowed us to specialise in internationally competitive, energy intensive export industries. Indeed, it could be said that higher use of clean Australian coal, for example, if it resulted in lower use of other people's dirtier coal, could produce more sensible global outcomes. We need an environmental policy environment which allows for that to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, our total contributions are so small. The fact is that, if we closed Australia down, it would not make any appreciable difference globally, but it would not do us much good here in Australia. In pre&hyphen;CheapJack opportunistic days, those over there once agreed with that approach. The shadow Treasurer said not so terribly long ago when they were in government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will play its part in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, but it will not take action which would have net adverse economic impacts nationally or on Australia's trade competitiveness . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is actually our position. We think that is a good and sensible position. That is the one the Prime Minister is defending as he meets with the Prime Minister of Britain and with the leader of America while Senator Hill does an admirable job in New York for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what is their position now? Let us see if we can establish which one of several it might be because yesterday the Leader of the Opposition sought to criticise the Prime Minister for the stand that he is taking in the interests of regional Australia and the jobs in regional Australia. Let us see what he said. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have opposed the idea of mandatory targets but we have also tried to recognise a bit of reality. There is a bit of concern out there around the globe on this issue, and we have had in place a set of activities designed to bring ourselves as close as possible to the sorts of targets that people around the globe expect of global citizens. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6435">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">High&hyphen;minded stuff. What that means is that he wants us to lock ourselves into a regime that would see Australians wear 20 times the impact per capita that the Europeans will wear and several times what the Americans will wear. That is what he wants. He wants us to adopt the globally accepted patterns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you what, while he is out there complaining about Newcastle jobs and while he is out sort of saying he wants to have a bet both ways, perhaps members like the member for Hunter would ask the real Mr Beazley to stand up because this is an important issue. If we go down the proposed road, you will see activity in the nonferrous metal industries probably cut by 50 per cent over the next 15 years, the coal industry by 20 per cent and the steel industry by another 20 per cent. So how about it? Member for Hunter, ask your leader to stand up. Will the real Mr Beazley please stand up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has no intention of closing Australian industries down. Equally, we do want to make a constructive contribution which will have a real and lasting effect on the environment.

Employer organisations are doing a lot to inform their membership about what can be done to improve employee relations for the benefit of both business and their employees. Whilst obviously we always want more and we want people to be even more focused on the changes, I publicly recognise the tremendous effort a lot of people have made in ensuring that there is a greater understanding of what we are doing and of the benefits of creating jobs and improving living standards as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there are some who somehow do not get the point.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has a real problem understanding what is going on. There are some contradictions in some of the things he says.

<ANSWER PAGE="6437" SPEAKER="Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP" NAMEID="8E4" ELECTORATE="Chisholm" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Health and Family Services" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. In the past 15 months, the government's approach to health has been based on two very strong philosophical commitments: first, a commitment to public health and the prevention of illness as well as the treatment of illness; and, second, a strong commitment to an evidence based approach to health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the public health side, we have instituted new programs in diabetes, cancer control and immunisation. We have had a third national HIV-AIDS strategy. For the first time ever, we have all state and territory governments on board for one nationally coordinated anti&hyphen;smoking campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the side of evidence based medicine, we have instituted a requirement that new items going on the Medicare benefits schedule have to have undergone thorough research and evaluation before they do so. In this, Australia is leading the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also had the capacity to work with some segments of the medical profession to make very significant savings to the budget and put those parts of the schedule on a cooperative basis much more strongly on evidence based. The radiologists, the nuclear medicine physicians and the optometrists have been fabulous in the way they have worked with the government in being prepared to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6438"> reign in a rate of growth in a way that is to the benefit of the public as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also made significant progress in the area of general practice. This morning, I went to South Australia and back to launch with the South Australian Minister for Health, Mike Armitage, the first of the coordinated care trials, Health Plus. This is starting to enrol patients from today. One of the people who attended that is Mr John Williams, a retired banker who has asthma. He has been one of the prototypes of this trial. Mr Williams was going into hospital three times a year with his asthma, but while he has been having his care much more closely monitored by his general practitioner, which takes extra time and money, he has been able to stay out of hospital for 12 months continuously. So by spending more money on his care and treatment we keep him out of hospital and save a substantial amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Aboriginal health, we have announced 35 new Aboriginal health services&mdash;over and above what was planned 12 months ago. We have framework agreements with every state and territory&mdash;with the exception of the Northern Territory and Tasmania, although Tasmania I hope to sign in the near future. We have had an Aboriginal sexual health strategy launched. We have also had, with the cooperation of the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the successful deployment of the army in a number of infrastructure projects in northern Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of private health insurance, we have allowed a much wider diversity of products than was previously available, special products for couples, special products that are called bucket products and a much greater use of front end deductibles, which people are now taking up as they are cheaper products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Treasurer has already mentioned, the rebate starts next Tuesday. These things together give an approach to health that is cost-effective. In that score, in the last two budgets, we are doing as well in containing the growth of cost as anywhere in the world&mdash;putting it on a strong evidence based 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> approach and also putting as much effort into trying to stop illness as we do to treating it.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has, for the second time, insisted that the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 be amended so that a compulsory attendance, full Senate ballot be held for the election of half the delegates to attend the convention. In other words, the Labor Party has joined with the Democrats to sabotage the convention bill. This is exactly the opposite of what the Leader of the Opposition said in February. He said he would take no action to hamper the preparation and proceeding of the convention as announced by the Prime Minister. It is another backflip and pike, and something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now have some information for which I thank the member for Moreton and others, which indicates exactly why this has happened.

What we proposed was a very fair and proper way to proceed with the creation of a convention, which was scheduled to meet in December. Now that deadline will not be able to be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Labor Party has proposed is that there should be $20 million more spent on a ballot for half the delegates for a one-off convention&mdash;$20 million more of taxpayers' money&mdash;rather than a postal vote, which is cost effective, fair and practical. They forget that the method used by most trade unions to conduct elections is by postal vote. The method used by so many clubs to elect their committees and boards is by postal vote.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Acting Prime Minister, members, Mr Speaker: it is exactly these circumstances which the ministers code of conduct is supposed to preclude from happening&mdash;exactly these circumstances. I am astounded, as I said earlier in the week, about the moral blindness of this government&mdash;that they can sit and listen to this 20&hyphen;minute political suicide note from the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) and be quite 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unsurprised that it does not include at the bottom of it two extra words: `I resign.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the minister fessed up to was active, in effect, day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day involvement in the business activities of his operation. What the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) tried to do once or twice was to selectively quote from the code of conduct to defend himself. I never thought that I would use a piece of correspondence from the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who we still feel regularly breaches the spirit at least of the matters relating to conflict of interest, to attack a fellow minister of his. But I have to say that Mr Moore, to our great surprise, looks like a knight in shining armour&mdash;a black knight, perhaps, being Black Jack&mdash;when you compare him with the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defence of the Acting Prime Minister was, `This is not a public company, which would mean that you would have to get out of it. It is a private company.' Ralsten is also a private company. The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs said, `In my ministerial portfolio I'm likely to find myself, at different points in time, in conflict with my public duties.' So what does he do? He gets Mr Wilde, who is in the same position as Mr Wood in relation to Mr Prosser's interest, to write:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I confirm your agreement with me that while you remain a minister you will not use your shareholding in the company to: (a) remove me as a director, (b) appoint any other director, (c) overturn or interfere with any decision I make in relation to the affairs of the company. I also confirm our agreement that I will not disclose or discuss with you the affairs or activities of the company during the period mentioned above.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Is this a weekly meeting to discuss the interests of the company? Is this a visit to sites, along with your company secretary, to examine your various business interests around the town of Bunbury, or Mr Moore's equivalent in this case?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Is this a document which, if it were to apply to you, indicates regular contact with city councillors to influence their business interests and their business concerns? Of course it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6444"> is not. It is in fact, if it is adhered to, the appropriate arms-length relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We go back to the beginning here. Remember who you are. You may by now have forgotten, but what you actually are is the minister for small business in charge of, among other things, questions related to the operation of private tenancies. You have everybody who is associated with that now demanding at least your disappearance from the portfolio. That was added to today in the remarks by Lisa Michael in the performance that she put in at the Press Club, making it amply clear what people in the business community think about your fundamental conflict of interest. Let us go through that again today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers are required to resign directorships in public companies and may retain directorships in private companies only if any such company operates, for example, a family farm, business or portfolio of investments and if retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the minister's public duty . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is not without significance that the Acting Prime Minister, when he chose to read out these things, excluded `is not likely to conflict with the minister's public duty' when we invited him to contemplate these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among these 119 meetings that we can so far discern from what the member has had to say and from what I hear emanating from Western Australia there are going to be one or two councillors whom you did not list during your discourse, your supposedly all&hyphen;encompassing comprehensive discourse, who will over the next little while make amply clear to you that they have had similar discussions with you and similar approaches. So you, no doubt, will be back in this place on some subsequent occasion and presenting, no doubt, your particular views again about your discussions with them when that occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us get to the heart of what has been going on here, because not only do we have here a minister who does not understand his responsibilities in relation to the conflict between public duty and private interest. We do not have just that particular problem associated with it. We also have a substantial problem&mdash; </PARA>

In that process, they have reason to believe in the way in which they have been treated and so disadvantaged that the full weight of the state has been used to support their opponents in a manner that is completely inappropriate and they have new heart and, having new heart, they are going to deal with this problem themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cannot face it because the government knows it is canting hypocrisy. The government knows that its code of conduct is no longer worth the paper it is written on. Let me just quote, because I think it sums up exactly the situation of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in relation to this, John Laws&mdash;I never thought I would often quote John Laws in this House&mdash;who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In spite of an amazing array of worldwide communications, we seem, really, to have sort of lost our Prime Minister. He seems oblivious to the fact that one of his senior ministers has lied to the Parliament. That's the truth. The Minister for Small Business, Geoff Prosser, has lied to the parliament. That was his biggest mistake. There are others. And he should be sacked. It's all fairly straightforward. Yet, our cricket-loving Prime Minister, obviously a bit miffed about the Test being rained out, appears more concerned with Mark Taylor's average than dealing with a rogue Minister.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What a perfect description: a rogue minister. That is what the Prime Minister should be dealing with. That is the person whom we are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6445"> dealing with in this censure motion here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Haven't we got so much ice to skate on when it comes to the unctuousness of the Liberal Party in relation to these matters in times past! The particular quote of the Prime Minister I used in question time was the Prime Minister's quote in moving a censure on us when we were in government at one point in time about one of our ministers&mdash;one of our ministers, I might say, who resigned at the end of it. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The supreme test of the courage and probity of the Prime Minister is whether he insists on Ministers observing the basic requirement of a minister, that is, that they tell the Parliament the truth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Do you actually think that this description of the minister's business interests for one second conforms with that paltry little declaration of `Bunbury&mdash;various lots' in the minister's statement to this parliament about what his personal interests were? Do you think the descriptions that we now have of conversations with Greiner conform one wit with those initial statements that, `I've had no conversations with any members of the Coles Myer board about these matters'? Do you think that that very high standard conforms with this minister's statement, when pressed to it, that he had had no discussion with any of these councillors or planning authorities of any nature&mdash;formal or indeed, as he went over the top when he talked about telephone calls, informal? Do you think it conforms with that? Of course it does not. This is a minister now who has lied, I say advisedly, repeatedly to this chamber.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. He has deliberately misled this chamber on repeated occasions. He has deliberately misled the Australian people in numerous interviews as far as these things are concerned when he has been asked to explain himself to the press.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has not engaged in that process of misleading without understanding the fact that he confronts some degree of danger himself. When we see the panoply of what has been concealed here, we understand why he does not want to talk to us and we under 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stand why he does not want this process to be thought through in this chamber and examined and analysed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Imagine yourself as a small business person out there in the community, particularly if you happen to be a tenant or a franchisee. Imagine yourself in their situation as they sit down and look at whether or not they think they are going to get fair dealing from this man. This is a man who is prepared to phone directors of Coles Myer so as to take out of the normal company planning processes a decision&hyphen;making process, which would have been essentially highly localised, probably to the level of the local Coles manager, or, if it went anywhere, to the state manager. He gets the most central and powerful section of that company actively engaged&mdash;to make sure that there is no backsliding&mdash;and turns it on another businessman, the sort of businessman who is not trying to mix his public and private duties and who is pursuing his affairs in the normal course of events as a private businessman. Having sooled Coles Myer national on, he goes back to all his mates on the Bunbury City Council and levers them to activate them and get them going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These mates on the Bunbury City Council also include the likes of the minister's architect. They are people actively engaged beyond just simple mateship; they are actively engaged in his business processes. He has been sooling them on to his business opponents. The Acting Prime Minister used as a defence, when I presented him with a question on this, that it did not succeed. That is the defence. The monopolisation of the power of the Australian government, combined with Coles central office, combined with all the mates on the council, actually hit a brick wall at the last point of the fence in the Bunbury City Council&mdash;where there are a few councillors with a bit of guts to stand up to him. This, of course,  obviates any possible error or any possible sin as far as the Deputy Prime Minister is concerned. That is what we are supposed to look at and applaud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say is that what we can applaud in that regard is the triumph of Australian democracy at the local level. What we cannot applaud is the people who would subvert it, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6446"> who happen to include the person who is not obeying the ministerial code as far as this exercise is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to see the minister constantly say, `McCourt's a Labor man.' Oddly enough, standing out there saying, `McCourt's a Labor man', they have already named a number of other councillors, who, I can assure them, are not Labor people, as people they have engaged actively in conversation. As I said before, there will be other councillors as far as this matter is concerned because this is by no means a complete piece of work, comprehensive though it may have seemed at first sight. There will be others and there is much more to go as far as this issue is concerned for this particular minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is that, oddly enough, in Western Australian politics&mdash;I do not expect people on this side of the continent to comprehend this&mdash;there is not partisan party politics in local government in Western Australia. Not many people vote in Western Australia either&mdash;you get about 10 per cent of the council turnout&mdash;but there is no party politics in local government. There are people who are members of political parties who involve themselves but they tend to form wavering coalitions. As often as not, you see groups of people who actually happen to be members of the Labor Party and members of the Liberal Party in one coterie in a local authority opposed to people of a similar mix on the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this minister is running slap&hyphen;bang into in Bunbury. That is why he keeps his active involvement in these companies. You have to understand that. His companies are 100 per cent dependent for their day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operations on decisions of federal governments, state governments and local governments, but particularly local governments. All three levels of government are constantly making decisions that advantage or disadvantage his companies. He cannot afford, as a businessman who has been actively engaged in some of the most bruising planning battles in Bunbury for years and years, to let go of his connection. He cannot afford to do that because he fears his fortune would disappear. He fears his interests would not be fully 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> protected. That is what his principal concern is about. That is why he cannot let it go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have said before in this place that we have no problem with business people in parliament or people with business experience. But at different points in time they have to make choices. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism made a choice: `I will remove myself from my private company, Ralsten. I will have no discussions on any of the business activities on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis with my company secretary because I know that, were I to do that, that would place me in a conflict of interest situation. I will trust my fortune to this man. I will take the risk.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's junior minister finds himself in exactly the same position. He does not exit. He gets right into it. If daily work of a company is actually a timetable as opposed to an expression about close involvement, how could any minister be involved in the daily work unless he actually sets up his ministerial office as his registered business office? We have not yet checked that. If you are going to define `daily' in that form, that is about the only way you could do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to define `daily' in the common sense way&mdash;as would everybody in the gallery here, everybody on the Liberal Party backbench hoping for Mr Prosser's position, all of us here on this side of the House and anyone with a modicum of common sense&mdash;then that would have to include a description that involves a weekly meeting with your partner, who happens to be your brother and also with your company secretary; a set of regular, or so it would seem from totting up the list, briefings with local planning authorities in relation to his multifarious property developments, including the ones at the heart of this; and an endless series of telephone calls to others associated with the same business. The commonsense approach would tell you, Minister, that that is daily. That is what is meant by daily activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this minister finds himself in this position of a conflict of interest. He is protected by a weak, worthless Prime Minister, by a bumbling Acting Prime Minister who does not know what he is doing, a supine Liberal backbench and a morally blind Liberal front 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6447"> bench. That is what is protecting him, and nothing else. No standards are protecting him, no reasonable interpretation of public duty is protecting him and no basic decency in our political life is protecting him. This government has the lowest standards in politics in living memory.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government rejects the censure motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). The Leader of the Opposition has made many allegations and substantiated none of them. The Leader of the Opposition is on a political pursuit to his own political advantage, unrelated to the facts surrounding the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I firstly cut to what I think is really the crux of the Labor Party's claim against this minister. The crux is not that he has a conflict of interest. The crux of it is not that he has used his official position. The crux of their claim is that he is in a position of managing on a daily basis the affairs of his business. That is the crux of the claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that they said during question time, `We have now read the statement and we have counted up 119 contacts,' is that it is their political objective to create the perception that this minister has breached the ministerial code. If you do not have a substantial basis to actually put your case, you create a picture. This must be the fifth or sixth censure motion we have had on this. When the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) started on his censure motion the other day, he said that they wanted to paint a picture of the minister. They were not actually interested in what the minister had done; that was the last of their interests. What they wanted to do was to paint a picture&mdash;an adverse picture&mdash;of the minister's conduct of his portfolio.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The guidelines do contain some general requirements on ministers in respect of the manner in which they conduct their businesses. What the guidelines do not say is that if you have been successful in business you have got to sell your family and personal financial interests. What they say, however, is that you are not to be in the conduct on a daily basis of managing those affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is a fair thing to ask yourself what is actually meant by `daily'. In our political lives we think of many things that are daily. If you are in the Labor Party on the front bench, you probably for years got the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Worker</EMPHASIS>. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Worker</EMPHASIS> basically tells you what you are going to say today on behalf of the workers. That is the definition of daily. If you are young and restless, your definition of daily is that every day you get up and ask yourself, `How am I going to make trouble for the Leader of the Opposition?' This is a daily occurrence. This is the ordinary meaning of the word `daily'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember that Joh Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen used to talk about his press conferences in Brisbane and he used to have a daily feeding of the chooks. That is something that happened every day. It was part of the day's work, part of his professional conduct of his business as a politician.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What you did, as you have just interjected, is read the statement. In the statement it says that he speaks to his brother once every couple of weeks. We have been in government for 60 or 70 weeks, so that makes 30 or 40 contacts, so that is 119 minus 40 or so. He speaks to his general manager, Colin Wood, weekly. So that is actually about 60 contacts since the election. Add 60 to 40 and you get about 100. So now what they are saying is that in 16 months he has had 19 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6448"> contacts in relation to his personal affairs, and somehow this is a daily management of his personal affairs. That is a complete nonsense, and I think it comes through in the statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has attempted to set out in the statement the basis on which and the regularity with which he has made contact with the people who are responsible for the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day management of his business. Why shouldn't he be able to do that? Take  the circumstances of a person who might have rural holdings. Let us say you are a member for a big rural or regional seat. It is pretty commonplace in the history of this country that from those rural seats we get people from the land. It is hardly an odd thing in a representative democracy that if you represent a rural seat the chances are you have some rural land&hyphen;holdings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us say you have been elected as a rural member. You come down to Canberra, you spend the week here, you go back on Saturday and you walk out to the back paddock. You open the back paddock gate and you let the cows run from one paddock to another. On that basis, if this was Geoff Prosser, he would have got up a statement saying, `On 70 occasions I was involved in closing the gate on the farm property once a week when I returned home.' Would that be the daily management, taking the cows from one paddock to another, which breaches the ministerial guidelines? As a matter of commonsense, it clearly is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Geoff Prosser's crime is that he is not a person from the land; he is a successful business person. We applaud people who have been successful in business. One of the problems of Canberra is that I think it is a fact that politicians have to be wary of getting out of touch. One of the great things about a representative democracy is that you get real people sitting in the parliament who really do know what is going on in business. That is very important to the future of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the point of view of those who are following this debate, a lot of people would say, `Why is the Labor Party running this smokescreen when I, as a constituent or as a voter, am concerned about the economy and the chances I have got of getting a job, of keeping the job that I have got or of my 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> children getting a job?' That is a pretty fair question for people to ask. The Labor Party have put up a baseless campaign against a minister when, in reality, what they ought to be doing is focusing on the big issues that really do concern this country, namely, unemployment, youth unemployment, foreign debt and all the other issues that are really important to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The starting point is that the crux of this claim against the minister is that he has been engaged in the daily conduct of his business, and yet there are no facts to substantiate that. In fact, the statement he made this morning is quite clear that this minister is not so engaged in the daily affairs of his business. What he is involved in, as he makes clear, are some issues that, from time to time, are relevant to him personally. He rings up John McCourt, a former councillor, and asks him when the council is going to make the road in front of his house. Is it a crime to ask a local councillor whether or not somebody is going to fix up the road and say that it would be a bit of a problem if they did it during winter and created a quagmire? According to the Labor Party, that is one of 119 cases about which he ought to be condemned&mdash;the fact that he made a phone call.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the member for Ballarat says it is a nonsense. John McCourt says it is a nonsense as well. He was asked on Channel 9 television this morning: `Did you consider it an unreasonable call or unethical for him to have made that comment to you?' McCourt said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, I did not actually. At the time I was a councillor with the Bunbury City Council, he was a constituent of Bunbury seeking advice as to whether a proposed development would succeed or not. I recall telling him that it may have difficulty because of planning stipulations and that was that. And I advised him to run it up the flagpole and council would have a look at it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is hardly an offensive phone call.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he was then further asked about the phone call, this is what he said. Firstly, the question: `Do you think that Mr Prosser should resign? Do you think the minister should resign?' He replied:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6449">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, I do not think he should resign. I think that the question of ministerial conduct is between the Prime Minister and Geoff. I think that it's a rather harsh code to adhere to in the context of all Geoff was doing was actually canvassing ideas as to whether I thought, as a councillor, that this proposal would get up or wouldn't. And, I mean, he didn't pressure me. He was just asking a general planning question.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is an important quotation that the Labor Party would never read out because it just puts things in a sort of commonsense context and completely denies the claim that they have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look briefly at the censure motion that they have moved today. Firstly, they claim that he has abused his ministerial office, but I do not think even the second speaker would claim that there is any evidence for that. The second one says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">having used his public office to secure private benefit in blatant breach of the requirements of the Prime Minister's code of conduct;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The fact of the matter is that that is based on the claim that he had a conversation with Nick Greiner. That claim in the censure motion is, in fact, itself misleading, as are the other claims that they make in respect of the Greiner telephone conversation. For example, in No. (3), they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">having phoned Mr Nick Greiner, Vice Chairman of Coles Myer to influence a decision to get Target as a lead tenant on the vacant Eaton lot owned by a company of which the Minister is an active Director;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is misleading. I will come back to it and say why. Then:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">having failed to disclose the full details of the telephone conversation between himself and Mr Nick Greiner in particular as it related to the Minister's attempts to thwart development on an opposing site;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is also misleading. Point No. (5) is misleading because that also relates to the Eaton site. Why is it misleading? Because this minister rang Nick Greiner, as he said in statement. Let's get his statement out. What he said was that he rang Nick Greiner and he asked Nick Greiner for a telephone contact on behalf of his brother. He did not ring Nick Greiner to seek to influence any aspect or decision that Coles Myer might take. In fact, the bottom line of all this is that he has got 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> no commercial arrangements with Coles Myer anyway. Talk about making a mountain out of a molehill. He has no commercial arrangements with Coles Myer&mdash;full stop. Absolutely none&mdash;full stop&mdash;has none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, all these things attempt to do is to paint a picture about which the facts are in fact otherwise. He made it clear today in the statement that he gave, and what a very comprehensive statement he gave. He has really provided a very detailed set of circumstances to the House so as to completely clarify absolutely each and every issue that has been raised against him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the Greiner matter, he spelt that out in that statement today. He says that he has already advised the House in relation to the call that he made to Greiner. He confirmed that he had had one discussion with Greiner&mdash;he only had one telephone conversation with Greiner. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that call I requested a contact point for my brother relating to a proposed Target store. Mr Greiner advised me that I should get my brother to write to him. Mr Greiner and I did not discuss any detail, nor any other matter, including car parking arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And that is important, because that is another aspect of this censure motion which the Labor Party is pushing against the minister. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also confirm that I have had no further contact with Mr Greiner and there are no commercial arrangements between Coles Myer and any company with which I am associated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When you go through the censure motion, there are 10 points. Four or five of them relate to the Greiner matter. That has been before this House now ad nauseam. There is no other additional material in respect of that. Here is a classic misrepresentation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">his repeated failure to table the letter between his brother and Mr Nick Greiner&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister has answered that question. As the minister said, he was not involved in the drafting of that letter. He was not a signatory to that letter and he has advised the House that he has not got the letter. So it is a neat little implication to attempt to censure the minister for the failure to table a letter between a third party and Mr Nick Greiner.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6450">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the other aspects, in No. (8) the claim is that the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">having failed to answer truthfully questions regarding that particular development despite being invited repeatedly to do so in this House this week;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That relates again to the Eaton site. Any objective observer would have to agree that this minister has in fact answered all of these issues. He has on every possible occasion come into the House and been absolutely open about it. Sure, he is a successful business person, but that also means that this minister is in touch with the business community. He does have an understanding of the solutions needed to improve Australia's economic performance. He is being unreasonably hounded, as I think I have shown when you analyse this document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that basis, this government does not believe that he ought to resign. He ought to stay. This minister has acted reasonably. This opposition, beset by its own internal divisions and its own lack of policy alternatives, is running this as a political ploy against the minister. When you take aside the smoke and bubble, the fact of the matter is that this minister is able, and this motion is, therefore, rejected. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to the Acting Prime Minister, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you have surprised me by your acceptance of that statement. What that has done is open up many more questions than answers have been provided for. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, if you go through the information contained there, even on a most reasonable and conservative estimate of the number of meetings this minister has had with councillors, with planning authorities, with councillors who are employees designing his shopping centres and with state ministers&mdash;and of the number of meetings he has had with and telephone calls he has made to different people&mdash;he is guilty of the daily activity of his business and of being involved with it as a minister of the Crown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last two weeks in this place, we have shown two things without a doubt. Firstly, we have shown there is a conflict of interest between this minister and his business interests and his ability to perform appropriate activities as a minister of the Crown. Secondly, we have demonstrated on no fewer than two occasions&mdash;so far&mdash;that he has misled this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much was made of the Nick Greiner phone call and letter. How many of the tenants of Mr Prosser, the minister for small business, and how many of those tenants who were at the National Press Club today to express their concern about this government and its response to the fair trading inquiry report could pick up the telephone and get through to Nick Greiner, the deputy chairman of the Coles Myer board, and say, `I just want a contact number for a relative', or a friend, or somebody, `so that they can get in touch with Target.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And why was it that a minister of the Crown needed to do that? If Steve Prosser, the minister's brother, is responsible for the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day running of this minister's private companies, why didn't Steve Prosser make the phone call? Why could he not have telephoned the head office of Coles Myer down in Melbourne and asked for their property manager? There is evidence to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6451"> suggest that somebody did&mdash;another Prosser, not Steve. We have tried to bring that out in this place, and we have asked for clarification of that, and this minister has refused to answer. He runs and he hides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in terms of the Greiner implication and the eleventh&hyphen;hour production in this place of that faxed message that the Leader of the House had to stand up here and read out and rely on&mdash;and which the Acting Prime Minister is relying on&mdash;that faxed message conveniently left out the fact that they were talking about a Target store at the Eaton site that the minister for small business owned. The reliance on that as a defence was staggering. I am sorry that the Leader of the House is not here, because I am sure that he would now have wanted to have had a little bit more time to reflect on the defence that he might mount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said, the simple act of picking up that telephone, as a minister of the Crown, and saying, `Nick Greiner, please. G'day, Nick, it's Geoff here, mate. I happen to have a couple of worries about a shopping centre development I've got down in Bunbury in Western Australia', is compromising. Was this about getting Target into the Eaton site? In a roundabout way, it may well have been. But the simple fact of the matter is that there was a competing site in central Bunbury, and on that competing site, which developers who were not Prosser developers wanted to develop, permission was given by the council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the eleventh hour, Coles Myer came along to the developer of this expansion and said, `We have an increased requirement for car parking spaces.' That was aimed at making that development unviable. If it subsequently fell over, it would mean the opportunity could be taken again for another site to be looked at for a Coles Myer Target store. And who do you think may have owned at least two other sites for that?</PARA>

As far as the Eaton site and the Nick Greiner telephone call are concerned, we have categorically shown in this place on a number of occasions that this minister misled the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said he did not have any phone calls, he did not discuss anything, he just asked for contacts. Then he came in here with a four&hyphen;paragraph statement. He was forced in, in the dead of night. He came scurrying in and elaborated, by putting in the key words: `Yes, it was about the Eaton site, and it was about Target.' Our good friend the Leader of the House said, `Game, set and match', that afternoon. That was a miscalculation on his part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second bit of misleading was reinforced today by this extraordinary statement of 10 pages by the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs when he reiterated the number of people he had spoken to. But, alas, he expanded on the number. We asked questions about a former Councillor McCourt. We were going to ask questions about another shire councillor, Councillor Major, but we did not need to necessarily because they were all laid out there, plus a few others for good measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many of these councillors, either in Bunbury or in the neighbouring shire, did this minister talk to about his private business ventures? Answer? I would suggest all of them. He claims there were never any formal approaches. He says, `It's informal.' It is stubbies and thongs with a sanger and a beer. He said it was an informal approach to a councillor to talk about Eaton, to talk about the Homemaker site expansion and to talk about various lots in Bunbury. This minister says that is an acceptable defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It looks as if the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) is going to speak second for the government in this debate for the government. I would like to know whether this minister is satisfied that this laughable and miserable set of excuses by the minister for small business is adequate. Does he think the minister is clear of the charges that have been levelled by this side of the parliament&mdash;charges that this minister for small business has misled the place on at least two occasions that I have outlined today, and that this minister for small business purports to have the small business community interest at heart, when in fact the only interest he has at heart is his own?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Dobell. Of course, the minister will address his remarks through the chair. I am confident he was not reflecting on the chair.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As soon as the charges are tested against the minister for small business, those opposite collapse. Their first star witness was Nick Greiner. Of course, he said that the minister did not seek to influence him and, in actual fact, did not influence him. We have Nick Greiner's letter to attest to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second star witness is John McCourt, who is one of yours; he is a Labor orientated councillor. There is nothing wrong with that; it is perfectly his choice. But just remember this: he is yours. On Channel 9 yesterday, he was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">J: Do you think that Mr Prosser should resign, do you think the Minister should resign?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">McCourt: No I don't think he should resign. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6455">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that the question of Ministerial conduct is between the Prime Minister and Geoff. I think that it's a rather harsh code to adhere to in the context of all Geoff was doing was actually canvassing ideas as to whether I thought as a councillor that this proposal would get up or it wouldn't. And I mean he didn't pressure me&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">let me repeat that: `I mean he didn't pressure me'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">he was just asking a general planning question.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So your second star witness has repudiated your charges. He says that the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs was not seeking to influence him and was not pressuring him. John McCourt attested to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two people who the opposition says the minister tried to influence say that he did not do that. They say categorically, unambiguously and without reservation that he did not seek to influence them. So how strong is your charge that the minister for small business used his public office for private gain? It is utterly baseless. It is non&hyphen;existent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no perception of influence, and there was no attempt to influence&mdash;real or otherwise. So what is the minister for small business guilty of? Using the phone and discharging his responsibilities legally as a director of a company&mdash;that is the charge that the Labor Party has made against him. In doing so, its case collapses around its ears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that all Labor has shown so far&mdash;after hours, days and dozens of questions in this parliament&mdash;is that the minister for small business does not use his ministerial position for his own gain and that he does not have day-to-day involvement in his business. So what is he being censured for? You have made out the case for him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh! The member for Dobell raises it again: he alleges, by way of interjection, that the minister for small business is guilty of misleading the parliament. I have already dealt with that. But, if members on my side will be tolerant and bear with me, I will repeat it: where is your production of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  to show his misleading of this House?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They had 40 minutes in the speeches of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Cunningham to produce some evidence against the minister for small business. The simple fact is that the Labor Party are going through the motions. Their questions in question time were written yesterday and were just bowled up again in a very obvious fashion. Of course, the minister's statement had answered them before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know what this is all about. It is a diversion. It is a lame attempt to explain your own backflips on policy and your own internal divisions. We on our side have canvassed those, but I suspect too briefly. We have been too soft on them. We really should have highlighted more.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are tearing themselves apart, as the member for Ballarat says. Whilst you carry on and allow yourselves to play these silly political games of no interest and no importance to the Australian public, we are getting on with the job for small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I would like to address is the incident involving Lisa Michael, whom the member for Cunningham spoke of earlier on. The slur continues; it just goes down another path. The member for Cunningham alleged that the staff of the minister for small business had ejected&mdash;there were overtones or connotations of forcible ejection&mdash;Lisa Michael, a representative of small business, earlier this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is the story: Lisa Michael and the United Retailers Association had no appointment with Minister Prosser this morning. They turned up to the office unannounced, without warning, and demanded a meeting. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6456"> They were politely told that the minister was not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know what; I will test this. I will roll up to the Leader of the Opposition's office one day with a group of my constituents&mdash;whether from the science portfolio or from Gippsland&mdash;and see how long we have to cool our heals in the waiting room or whether we will be asked to come back another time and make an appointment. If there is one thing you cannot accuse the minister for small business of it is not being available and accessible to small business. He has worked hard in the portfolio and with success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the tangible benefits. What about the capital gains tax that has been so substantially dropped for small business. What about the reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor? What about industrial relations&mdash;reforming the unfair dismissal laws?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about red tape, with the report of the task force having been presented to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 1 November last year? There were 62 recommendations in that report, and in our first term there was a 50 per cent cut in paperwork in respect of the compliance burden. We are setting the future agenda for small business under the leadership of the minister for small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister for small business, on behalf of the coalition parties&mdash;the government&mdash;wishes to reduce the taxation burden on small business. We want to clarify the tax system and make it more simple, less compliant. We have already reformed areas of fringe benefits tax. The list goes on and on.

Is it a fact that His Excellency the Governor&hyphen;General receives credentials from heads of mission on days approximately a month apart but that it is possible for ambassadors and high commissioners to have to wait for up to three months prior to presentation of credentials? That, of course, means that the head of mission is unable to carry out his or her responsibilities during that period.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Seventy&hyphen;five years ago the Commonwealth of Australia enacted a new Public Service Act. In spite of being amended on a piecemeal basis more than a hundred times, it has failed to keep up with changes in the character of public administration. It speaks to a bygone era in which employment powers were highly centralised; in which there was a preoccupation with process rather than results; in which every management action was prescribed and regulated; and in which enormous effort went into maintaining standard terms, conditions and classifications across the service, from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> telegraph boys to Treasury economists. The bill that I put before the parliament today proposes a modern act which speaks coherently to the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years public servants have sought to create a more flexible workplace environment and to devolve management responsibility. Unfortunately their creative efforts are all too frequently diverted into finding ways around the legislative restrictions that stymie them at every turn. The APS remains rule&hyphen;bound. The current act, for example, devotes about 30 pages to the processes of selection and recruitment, 40 pages to dealing with misconduct and some 60 pages to addressing `mobility' arrangements. This cascades down into a plethora of subordinate legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of such prescriptive control, public servants and taxpayers both bear a heavy cost. Personnel decisions are slow, paper&hyphen;driven and labour&hyphen;intensive. Management is excessively legalistic and risk&hyphen;averse. Innovation is stifled. Workplace flexibility is reduced. This cannot be allowed to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reforming the Australian Public Service is a key element of our government's micro&hyphen;economic reform agenda. The Australian people are entitled to see that the taxes they pay are used in the most efficient and effective manner and that the services they receive are of a high standard. This bill will make the service more efficient in its delivery both of policy advice to government and of programs to the public. It will promote higher performance in the APS by devolving management responsibility to individual agencies and, at the same time, ensure that public interest objectives are maintained through enhanced accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government belatedly sought to address these issues. It set up a review of the Public Service Act (the McLeod review), accepted most of its recommendations, undertook long negotiations with the public sector unions and, in the end, failed to act. No reforms were implemented before the government left office. Such inaction was not because the previous government failed to recognise the need for significant reform of the Australian Public Service. Indeed in a speech in July 1994 the then Minister for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6462"> Finance, now Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Kim Beazley, foreshadowed that `the Australian Public Service will be integrated into, and work in close alignment with the broader Australian community . . . Commercialisation of government activities will continue. Competition will become a commonplace, in some cases through privatisation . . . the Commonwealth public service will become a smaller . . . elite service'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New legislation was seen as a key component of this change agenda. In speeches around Australia in October and November 1995 the then Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, Gary Johns, emphasised that the `introduction of a new Public Service Act provides us with an opportunity for the APS to be placed on a similar footing to the private sector.' His progress report on the new Public Service Act, tabled in this chamber in November 1995, argued that `the parliament must establish a more contemporary employment framework for (the APS) to work within' and, to that end, `proposed that secretaries and agency heads be given employment powers in their own right.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill I introduce today will complete that unfinished business. It builds on the good intentions of Mr Johns. But it will also do far more. It will guide the Commonwealth's system of public service into the next century. It provides a wholly new conceptual framework, a contemporary piece of legislation, which will enable the Australian Public Service to meet future challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However the bill is bolder than that proposed by the previous government in two key regards. First, it provides far greater freedom for public servants to manage their own workplaces. The system of industrial relations in this country has been transformed by the Workplace Relations Act 1996. While we&mdash;like our predecessors&mdash;propose to put employment practices in the APS on a similar footing to the private sector, that footing is now set on a foundation of agreement&hyphen;making between employers and employees at the enterprise level. It is an approach based on devolution and direct negotiation. In place of the old adversarial system both the private and public 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sectors are now encouraged to place emphasis on direct workplace relationships and mutual interest. Employers and employees are empowered to make decisions, including on wages and conditions, at the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The half&hyphen;hearted enterprise bargaining introduced to the APS by the previous government foundered on central control and third party negotiation. We will not allow that to happen. Heads of agencies and their staff will be able to sit down together and work out the systems, structures and conditions which are most appropriate to their own organisation and to set them down in Australian workplace agreements or certified agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, the bill I introduce has far more protection of the public interest. It is one thing to set down in legislation the values of public service; it is quite another to establish the mechanisms for review and evaluation which will ensure that they are upheld. This bill, unlike the proposals foreshadowed by the previous government, provides far greater power of review and investigation to the Public Service Commissioner, and far more scrutiny by the parliament. For the first time the Public Service Act will provide an effective legislative basis for public accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me emphasise that our government's approach to public service reform is not driven by ideology. It is a pragmatic response to getting better value from public funds. It is driven by the practical demands of modernising the service in the interests of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present the costs of managing the APS are more than double that of best practice in the private sector. We seek to improve the relative performance of the Public Service by acknowledging the improvements that have already been made and addressing the manifest inefficiencies which remain. It is evolutionary change, although at a faster pace and on a broader front than the previous government was willing to countenance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nor is reform the result of some deep&hyphen;seated antipathy to public servants. My personal experience is that Australian public servants are willing to work hard and conscientiously for the government of the day. It is the structure, systems and culture of the APS 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6463"> that need to be improved, not the commitment of individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the bill I introduce is informed by the views of public servants themselves. Many thousands read the discussion paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a best practice Australian Public Service</EMPHASIS>, which I issued last November; over a thousand met in focus groups around the country to discuss it; some 250, mostly individual public servants, made submissions in response to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have personally conducted sessions in Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney, Brisbane, Townsville and Canberra. I am pleased that Senators Cheryl Kernot and Lyn Allison were on occasion able to join me. Those we spoke with, mostly administrative service officers, were clear about the frustrations they felt in working within the present legislative framework. Most of them wanted change and they wanted it as soon as possible. It is my firm belief that the bill that I present will give them much of what they asked for. Certainly it will provide them with a far more rewarding environment in which to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has also been improved significantly by the contribution of union representatives. I have had more than 10 hours of meetings with the ACTU and public sector unions in the preparation of this bill. More than 30 changes have been made to the original draft as a consequence of their suggestions and our discussions. It has been a useful and constructive process of consultation which I intend to build upon in the months ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I have introduced the bill now in order to seek passage by the end of next sitting, I anticipate that the unions will continue to play a positive role as we develop the subordinate legislation&mdash;the regulations and commissioner directions&mdash;before they are introduced to parliament. Both the regulations and directions will be disallowable instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One strong and recurrent message that has emerged in the discussions I have had both with groups of public servants and with the public sector unions is a wish to ensure that the traditional ethos, conduct and values of public service are preserved. This bill does 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this&mdash;and more. It sets out the public interest, and reinforces the values of the public service, in a way that has never been done before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To achieve maximum workplace flexibility while maintaining a high level of public accountability, the Public Service bill establishes an interlocking framework of powers and responsibilities, integrated within a genuinely devolved managerial environment. The bill articulates the distinctive character of Australia's public service and parliament's expectation of it in a way that is entirely absent from the present act. It sets out the core features of the APS and enshrines and protects them through legislation. They can be modified in the future only through the parliamentary process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill explicitly acknowledges that the APS is to be apolitical, fulfilling its functions in an impartial, non&hyphen;partisan and professional manner. For the first time, legislation will prevent ministers interfering in individual staffing decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secretaries of departments will be required to uphold 11 key values of public service. They will be held accountable for the manner in which they exercise administrative power. Merit will remain a cornerstone of public service. The employment decisions for which secretaries are responsible must be made without nepotism, patronage, administrative favouritism or political influence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Merit, of course, is difficult to define. In discussions with me, the Women's Electoral Lobby has suggested that the most appropriate definition to adopt is that of the CCH <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian &amp; New Zealand Equal Opportunity Law and Practice</EMPHASIS>; namely, `the relationship between a person's job&hyphen;related qualities and those genuinely required for performance in particular positions'. I agree that this needs to be reflected as the standard agency heads employ when seeking the person most suitable for a position, and it is being considered in the context of the definition to be set out in the commissioner's direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made clear on a number of occasions, our government wants to provide a workplace in which public servants offer advice in a frank, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6464"> fearless and honest manner&mdash;and, having done so, implement the decisions of the government of the day in a professional manner. To ensure the independence of its most senior advisers, secretaries, the traditional methods of selection will continue. The Prime Minister will make appointments only after receiving advice from the head of his own department or, with respect to that position, from the Public Service Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also requires secretaries to ensure that they maintain a workplace free of discrimination. Indeed, it goes considerably further. Each department will be required to have in place a workplace diversity program. This is intended to ensure that there is equal employment opportunity and that workplace practices are flexible enough to enable staff to balance their work and family responsibilities. We want to ensure that the APS reflects the face of the Australian community it serves, but, equally, we want to provide a better working environment to those who provide the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only secretaries who will be held accountable for maintaining the highest standards of honesty. Unlike the 1922 act, the bill I present today includes a code of conduct for all public servants. This will ensure that the code is legally enforceable and strengthens its value as a public statement of the standards of behaviour expected of those who work in the public service. While you cannot legislate for integrity you can establish a legislative environment in which it is nurtured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will set out the public interest. It will also provide new mechanisms for its protection. To this end the powers and independence of the Public Service Commissioner are to be considerably enhanced. The commissioner will be required to uphold the traditional ethos of public service, ensure appropriate standards of behaviour for public servants and maintain public confidence in the way they do their business. The bill provides the commissioner with considerable powers to review, evaluate and make recommendations on APS employment policies or practices, either at the minister's request or at her or his own instigation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the bill, the commissioner will issue directions to secretaries to ensure that employment decisions are based on merit and fairness. Agency heads and APS employees will be required to comply with these directions, as well as with the APS values and code of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commissioner will also be required to report to parliament each year on the state of the Australian Public Service. She or he will be able to report at any other time on particular matters that are deemed to warrant it, and have the same strong inquiry powers proposed by our government for the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This enhancement of the commissioner's ability to protect the public interest is something which the previous government was unwilling to embrace. In a recent letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> (6 June 1997), the former Public Service Commissioner under the previous government, Mr Denis Ives, noted how welcome was our government's intention to strengthen the role and powers of that office. According to Mr Ives, an `expansion of the powers of the Public Service Commissioner was canvassed at the time of the McLeod committee but was generally opposed within government at that time'. He recognises that the reforms introduced by our government, unlike those previously contemplated, `will go a long way towards ensuring a more satisfactory and balanced framework of accountability and integrity for the future'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of the role of parliament in scrutinising the administration of the APS is acknowledged in this bill. It requires the independence of parliament and those who work for it. The operations of the parliamentary departments are presently covered by the Public Service Act. This is not appropriate. Staff in the parliamentary departments owe their allegiance to parliament rather than to the government. There is a need to protect the independence of the presiding officers, singly and jointly, as employing authorities. This can best be done by establishing a separate statutory regime for those who work in the parliamentary departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill makes provision for the creation of bodies to be known as executive agencies. This will provide a more satisfactory arrange 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6465"> ment than the present use of section 67 of the constitution where the government wishes to establish an organisation with a degree of separateness from a minister's department and where no statutory powers are required to be exercised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will enable public servants to seek a review of employment decisions. By regulation, all agencies will be required to have in place review mechanisms which afford due process and procedural fairness to those who complain that they have been treated unfairly. To the greatest extent possible, it is intended that these workplace grievances will be resolved at the workplace level. That is the basis of good employee relations in a devolved environment. However, the regulations will also establish a process of external review for those occasions on which grievances cannot be satisfactorily settled within agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An APS employee is entitled to seek review of actions that relate to his or her employment. The commissioner who upholds Public Service values and conduct, and who sets the standards expected of employers, will now have the power to investigate breaches of them and to make recommendations on how they should be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of the present complicated and convoluted processes, which have made decision&hyphen;making legalistic and time&hyphen;consuming, streamlined arrangements will be set in place. There is no longer a need for a separate statutory office holder nor, indeed, for additional legislation. The bill I put before honourable members replaces not only the Public Service Act 1922 but the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984. That latter act will now be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the President of the Administrative Review Council, Professor Marcia Neave, has supported access to external review as a mechanism for upholding the merit principle. `In particular,' she notes in a letter to the Public Service Commissioner on 30 May 1997, `the Council supports the proposal that the Public Service Commissioner will be able to report to the minister or parliament on a grievance matter that has not been satisfactorily resolved or an investigation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> carried out either on the Commissioner's own motion or at the request of a minister or Secretary.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The powers of review are to be extended in one crucial regard. Until now public interest whistleblowers in the APS have not had an established mechanism to hear allegations of misconduct within the service. To remedy that defect, our government will ensure that where whistleblowers are dissatisfied with the response of their own agencies, they may ask the commissioner to investigate. Equally important, the bill provides whistleblowers with legislative protection against victimisation or discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill considerably enhances accountability. It acknowledges and protects the public interest as never before. It considerably improves parliamentary scrutiny of the way the Australian Public Service undertakes its delegated responsibilities on behalf of government. It recognises and protects the distinctive ethos of public administration. It provides a foundation for a service in which actions and decisions are open and transparent. At the same time, it encourages the APS to take on the best practices of contemporary management, public or private, Australian or overseas. It provides the legislative underpinning for continuous improvement in the way the Public Service manages public funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Greater devolution is crucial to success. The bill places employment powers with secretaries. Part 4 of the bill makes it clear that agency heads, on behalf of the Commonwealth, wield all the rights, duties and powers of an employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agency heads will be given the power, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to engage persons as employees. Within the law, it is they who will determine many of the conditions which attach to employment. It is they who will determine the remuneration and other terms of employment. It is they who will assign duties or terminate employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vast majority of provisions in the current Public Service Act will no longer be required. Detailed control over matters such as transfer, promotion, advancement, suspension, leave of absence, mobility and re&hyphen;integration will be removed. So, too, will most of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6466"> the provisions relating to the management of misconduct, discipline and performance. These are matters that are best resolved at the workplace level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In exercising their employment powers, agency heads will continue to be supported by a senior executive service able to provide high level policy advice and professional leadership both within and across agencies. Responsibility for the appointment of these executives will now be devolved to agency heads although, in order to ensure that decisions are made on the basis of merit, the commissioner will issue directions on appropriate selection processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be those who seek to characterise these changes as diminishing the fairness with which employees are treated in the APS. This is, of course, a nonsense. The new act will not erode the position of employees in terms of dealing with their employer. They will have access to the same protections in dealing with their employer as apply to the rest of the Australian work force under the Workplace Relations Act. In addition, they will be managed under an umbrella of APS values which guard their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the devolution of employment powers will provide public servants with far greater freedom than they have ever enjoyed before. The conditions of their employment will be tailored to the particular circumstances of their own workplace without unnecessary legislative restriction or central regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Devolution will ensure that the rhetoric of public service values becomes reality. Employers and employees will be required to work together to establish a fair, flexible, safe and rewarding workplace.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Devolving employment decisions will provide a firm foundation for cooperative workplace relations based on genuine consultation and direct communication. Each individual agency&mdash;indeed, each distinct workplace&mdash;will have the opportunity and incentive to become a model employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister and public service minister will continue to have appropriate powers to ensure that the interests of the service as a whole are protected. The public service minister, for example, may, subject to the application of awards and agreements, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> determine the remuneration and other conditions of service where it is desirable because of special circumstances. The minister may also make rules about the classification of APS employees. These powers will ensure that an effective balance can be struck between devolution to agencies and service&hyphen;wide cohesion. Similarly, the Public Service Commissioner will retain the power to compulsorily transfer employees between agencies where they are excess or where it is required in order to give effect to machinery of government changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill that I put before the parliament today is distinguished by its brevity. In length it represents only about five per cent of the legislation which it replaces. Equally important, it is written in a clear and easy style. In my view, it should be required reading for all those who seek a career in the Australian Public Service. It sets out for them their rights and obligations, the values to which they should aspire and the conduct which parliament expects of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is also distinguished by its balance. It balances enhanced accountability for the public interest with devolved responsibility for the private interests of employees. The framework within which the conditions of employment in the APS are set will be similar to that in the private sector, but accountability for the conduct of that employment will recognise the distinctive character and ethos of the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new Public Service Bill provides a succinct message about the expectations of a public service within a democratic system of governance in a form appropriate to the twenty&hyphen;first century. It articulates the essential qualities that are necessary to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the public service; recognises the need for an employment framework which is likely to provide best value for public funds; and establishes the means to ensure that the conduct of public servants is open to scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, for the first time we have a Public Service bill which explicitly focuses on public accountability for the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I inform the House that the bill, together with the Public Employment (Consequential 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6467"> and Transitional) Amendment Bill, will be referred to the Joint Committee on Public Accounts for review. I envisage that the committee may report on both bills on or before Thursday, 4 September 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding, I also wish to pay tribute to the many people who have contributed to the preparation, drafting and the like of this particular important piece of legislation. Whilst many have been involved, I particularly note and thank for their contributions Mr Peter Richards, the chief of staff in my office, who has worked tirelessly to bring this legislation to the parliament, and also Dr Peter Shergold, the Public Service Commissioner, and all who work with him, on the good work that they have done to date in bringing this bill to fruition.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> to enable the transition from the old to the new employment framework;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> to validate actions and decisions taken under the former legislation; and</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> to make consequential amendments to the extensive range of legislation which incorporates references to the Public Service Act 1922.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The transitional provisions fall into three broad areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, it is necessary to set in place conversion arrangements for those who work in the APS. With the removal of the concept of office for APS staff and the creation of a single employment category, officers and employees covered by the existing act are converted to employees in their corresponding agencies with their corresponding classifications. Fixed&hyphen;term secretaries to departments under the old act will become secretaries of their corresponding departments under the new act. Similarly, the person holding office as the Public Service Commissioner under the existing act will become the Public Service Commissioner under the new act as if he had been appointed under the new act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, as the Public Service Bill 1997 is primarily principles based, there are some conditions covered by the Public Service Act 1922 that require transitional arrangements because they will no longer be regulated in the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important of these are the arrangements governing the rights of return of staff who have left the APS to take up non&hyphen;APS public employment. The current, very complex, legislative conditions represent a considerable liability for APS agencies. They will be replaced, subject to appropriate transitional arrangements, with a simpler model under which agency heads will agree to extend unpaid leave to employees to take up such employment where this is in the interest of the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will also be appropriate arrangements for the parliamentary departments pending the development of their own legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Third, there is a need to provide for the continuation of processes already set in train. Action may have commenced under the Public Service Act 1922 or the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 that will not be completed by the time the new Public Service Act is proclaimed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6468">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to matters such as appointments, promotions, suspensions, transfers and advancements, as well as to appeals, grievances and other reviews of employment decisions. To enable action to be completed, regulations will be made to ensure the continuation of those processes after the new act is proclaimed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The validation of actions and decisions taken under the former legislation will be largely dealt with in regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the consequential amendments, the acts specified in schedule 1 to this bill will be amended or repealed as set out in that schedule. The amendments can be divided into the following categories:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> changes in the current provisions relating to staffing to reflect the new employment framework;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> other miscellaneous amendments to ensure appropriate links to the new APS employment framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also deals with the consequences of devolving the arrangements for setting the salaries of the Senior Executive Service (SES). The link of the remuneration of members of parliament with the SES band 2 minimum salary will be replaced by a link to the classification structure created by the Remuneration Tribunal for certain statutory offices. It is not intended to increase the level of remuneration.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subject to any special requirements in relation to particular consequential amendments, this bill will commence on the same day as the Public Service Act 1997. Where this bill amends an act which has not yet commenced, the amending provision in the schedule to this bill will commence immediately after the commencement of that other act. Where this bill amends a section in another act and the section has not yet commenced, the amending provision in the schedule to this bill will commence immediately after the commencement of that amended section.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments have no financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Collectively, the arrangements proposed in this bill will provide the necessary certainty and continuity of administrative and management arrangements for the Australian Public Service.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill is intended to ensure that small businesses are exempted from the federal unfair dismissal provisions, in respect of new employees. This exemption is necessary and appropriate, given the special features of small business&mdash;and it is necessary, to ensure continuing growth in employment in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members will be aware that the government's commitment to an unfair dismissal exemption for small business was announced on 24 March 1997, as part of the government's small business statement. Members will also be aware that a regulation was made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to give effect to such an exemption which was to take effect from 1 July 1997. This bill is introduced today to give effect to the government's intentions because that regulation was disallowed this morning by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in launching the government's small business statement, helping small business to grow, employ, export and invest in Australia's future has been a top priority for the government since its first day in office. The government's economic and industrial relations policies are central to its agenda for the growth and development of the small business sector&mdash;and the government is also committed to tackling the impediments to small business imposed by unnecessary government regulation and paperwork, as set out in the small business statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has, of course, already made substantial progress in labour market reform, which is and will be of particular benefit to small business. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996 has changed the federal industrial relations system, and the relationship between federal and state industrial relations systems, providing small business with greater opportunities to develop industrial relations arrangements best suited to their individual circumstances. In particular, small business employ 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ers have new opportunities to make direct agreements with their employees. Small businesses that choose to remain in the award system are benefiting from a simplified and more flexible system; small businesses now have greater certainty with respect to industrial action within their business; the Employment Advocate has been given a specific charter to assist small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, unfair dismissal was one of the most important industrial relations issues for small business, prior to the last election. Our commitment, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better pay for better work</EMPHASIS>, was to introduce a new unfair dismissal scheme, which would recognise the circumstances facing small business: and we have done this. The new system is more balanced and fair to both employers and employees. It is less legalistic and costly, with an emphasis on conciliation. Employers are protected from frivolous and malicious claims by the requirement for a filing fee and access to costs where a claim is vexatious. In considering unfair dismissal claims, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has to consider a range of factors, including the possible effect of any order on the viability of the employer's business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes are important&mdash;but they have not gone far enough, for small business. It is an unavoidable fact that the defence of an unfair dismissal claim, however groundless, is especially burdensome for small businesses. In many larger businesses, expertise and resources can be put into recruitment and termination procedures. Small businesses have no such resources. Even attendance of witnesses at a hearing can bring a small business to a standstill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been listening to the concerns of small businesses, their experiences of the impact of unfair dismissal claims&mdash;particularly under the previous government's provisions&mdash;and their fears that the simple fact of employing someone makes them vulnerable to unfair dismissal claims. The government was mindful of all of these concerns and fears in the development of last year's legislation: the issue was amongst those raised in the government's discussions with the Australian Democrats, and the scope for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6470"> additional exemptions, by the regulations, was always there, as part and parcel of the act's provisions on termination of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 170CC of the act allows for exclusion of `employees in relation to whom the operation of the provisions causes or would cause substantial problems because of . . . the size or nature of the undertakings in which they are employed'. And this language is drawn directly from the International Labour Organisation's Termination of Employment Convention, 1982, which expressly allows exclusions of this type.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our announcement of the small business exclusion on 24 March 1997 was welcomed by small business. Rob Bastion of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That's obviously the jewel in the crown . . . that is the one which will actually create jobs . . . I'm certain of it'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And this is the crucial point&mdash;this exemption is not just about removing a burden from small business, it is about the positive employment benefits of the expanded job opportunities that will surely result from the removal of that burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the terms of the bill itself. The exemption is to commence on royal assent. However, it will not affect existing employees. As it is intended to encourage new employment, the exclusion will only apply to employees who are first engaged by the relevant employer after the commencement of the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exemption is from the federal unfair dismissal provisions, only. Employees will still be protected by the Workplace Relations Act. Section 170CK protects employees against dismissal because of any discriminatory reason. Sections 170MU and 170WE prohibit dismissal of an employee because the employee engages in protected industrial action, seeking a certified agreement or in AWA industrial action. Section 298K in the freedom of association part of the act prohibits dismissal which involves victimisation or is otherwise contrary to freedom of association. Section 170CM prohibits dismissal without 1&hyphen;5 weeks notice (depending on the employee's length of service and age), or pay in lieu, except in cases of serious misconduct.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exemption also does not affect the rights of apprentices in small businesses, who have a particular need for protection, given the additional impact that any break in the continuity of their employment may have in terms of attainment of qualifications. This bill will not affect existing rights in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exemption applies only to businesses employing 15 or fewer employees. This size of small business was chosen because of the precedent provided by the Employment Protection Act 1982 (NSW), which was introduced by the Wran Government and followed by the then Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the 1984 Termination, Change and Redundancy Test Case. An exemption for businesses of this size will benefit a substantial proportion of all businesses in the federal jurisdiction but will not cover too many businesses of such size and complexity that they are likely to have a separate management structure, which would facilitate defence of unfair dismissal claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides that, in counting the number of employees in a business, casual employees are only to be counted if they have been engaged on a regular and systematic basis for at least 12 months. The intention of this exclusion is to reflect the fact that a business which occasionally engages additional casual employees is not necessarily a large business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure. I commend the government's proposals to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill makes a number of technical amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6471"> (the WR Act) and other legislation. The amendments are aimed at clarifying existing provisions and ensuring that they operate in the manner originally intended by the legislation. The bill also corrects some minor drafting anomalies and oversights. These minor changes will give appropriate effect to the major reforms which have been achieved through the enactment of the Workplace Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act is delivering genuine flexibility and choice at the workplace level. Over 1600 new agreements have been certified, including 47 agreements made directly between employers and employees, and over 500 Australian workplace agreements have been approved. The act is better balanced than its predecessors and reinforces a stronger sense of the rights and responsibilities of participants in the system. Section 127 of the act is providing an effective remedy to prevent and stop illegitimate industrial action, with over 100 applications for section 127 orders being dealt with by the commission to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Substantial progress has been made towards harmonisation of federal and state systems through complementary legislation and a cooperative approach to administrative arrangements and service delivery. The scope for our reforms to continue to bring about the productivity improvements which are necessary to underpin sustainable economic growth will be further enhanced by the technical amendments proposed in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Awards and arbitration&mdash;Part VI of the WR Act</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill clarifies the limitation on the commission's capacity to exercise its arbitral powers during a bargaining period for a proposed certified agreement. The legislation limits the commission's power to arbitrate during a bargaining period in relation to matters at issue between bargaining parties. The fundamental objective is for the parties to reach agreement without arbitration. The commission should not arbitrate, for example, in relation to a claim for a new allowance to be paid if that is at issue during bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, a possible unintended consequence of limiting access to arbitration is that it may prevent the commission from varying 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an award to include a "safety net wage adjustment" to give effect to the national wage case safety net decisions where bargaining periods have been initiated and wages are an issue between the parties. The bill therefore amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to make clear that the limitation on arbitration during a bargaining period does not prevent the commission from exercising its arbitral powers to deal with an application to vary an award to include a safety net wage adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also clarifies the status of awards made under section 170MX of the act, making clear that they are enforceable in the same manner as other awards. It also makes clear that, where awards are simplified by the commission during the award simplification process, any provision which has been included in a simplified award because it is incidental and necessary for the effective operation of the award does not cease to have effect at the end of the simplification interim period.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Certified Agreements&mdash;Part VIB of the WR Act</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill addresses two issues which have emerged during the operation of the certified agreement provisions of the act.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the bill clarifies the time limit allowed for applications to be lodged for the certification of an agreement. Secondly, it makes clear that the 14 day period provided to employees to consider a certified agreement does not have to start again if an employer takes on new staff during the approval period. Any new starters will, of course, have to have the effect of agreement explained to them and be provided with a copy of the agreement, but the amendment will avoid the delays and unnecessary expense which would result if the approval period were to start again from scratch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Employment Advocate</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">and Australian Workplace Agreements&mdash;Parts IVA &amp; VID of the WR Act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also included in the bill are some procedural amendments aimed at facilitating the smooth operation of the Australian workplace agreement (AWA) provisions. These changes include an extension to the time limit for lodging AWAs and empowering the Employ 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6472"> ment Advocate to waive strict compliance with the technical requirements relating to the filing of AWAs. The time limit for lodging AWAs with the Employment Advocate is to be extended from 14 to 21 days, recognising that a 14 day limit might be difficult to meet, especially where the parties are in rural centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provision will also be made for the Employment Advocate to waive strict compliance with the technical filing requirements for AWAs and ancillary documents. The advocate will have to be satisfied that the waiver would not disadvantage a party to the AWA. In the absence of such a waiver, the Employment Advocate has had to return a number of AWAs lodged to date because the applications failed in some minor way to meet the filing requirements. The amendment will not affect the substantive requirements to be met by an AWA. There will still need to be a strict compliance with the substantive requirements, such as the provisions relating to the no&hyphen;disadvantage test and genuine consent. The amendment provides only for defects of a technical nature to be waived. This will avoid the waste of time and resources involved in correcting minor defects whilst ensuring that the interests of AWA parties are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also corrects some anomalies in the provision dealing with the right of entry and powers of authorised officers of the Employment Advocate. At present, authorised officers who are investigating possible freedom of association breaches can only enter premises where they believe relevant documents may be located. By contrast, authorised officers investigating AWA breaches and Department of Industrial Relations inspectors investigating breaches of awards or certified agreements may enter premises where relevant work is being performed and interview employees without being limited to premises where documents may be held.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill corrects this anomaly by providing for authorised officers to enter places of business for the purpose of interviewing persons in connection with possible breaches of the freedom of association provisions of the act. As is the case with the existing rights 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of entry, the new provision does not allow access to premises used for residential purposes, and the right to interview does not empower an authorised officer to compel a person to answer questions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">No&hyphen;Disadvantage Test&mdash;Part VIE of the WR Act</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also amends the process by which the designated awards can be determined by the commission and the employment advocate for the purpose of applying the no&hyphen;disadvantage test to agreements. The act presently provides that where there is no award covering the work of employees who are to be covered by a certified agreement or AWA, the commission or the advocate, as the case requires, is to `designate' an appropriate federal award for the purpose of applying the no&hyphen;disadvantage test to the agreement. The bill will allow the commission or the advocate to designate a state award as the benchmark for the no&hyphen;disadvantage test where there is no federal award covering work of the same kind as that performed by the employees whose work is to be subject to an agreement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Termination of Employment&mdash;Part VIA of the WR Act</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill clarifies the application of state laws in relation to termination of employment of an employee covered by a federal award or agreement. It also ensures that there is consistency in the time limits for making applications in respect of termination of employment, and makes it clear that each of the various types of application relating to termination of employment may be discontinued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provision is also made for the maximum amount of compensation which may be awarded in respect of an unfair dismissal or unlawful termination of employment to be calculated by reference to the amount of remuneration to which the applicant was entitled for the previous six months. At present the act provides for the compensation limit to be calculated by reference to the amount received by the employee during the preceding six months with the employer. The proposed amendment will benefit employees by ensuring that the compensation limit is calculated by reference to the amount which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6473"> an employee was entitled to receive, if that amount would be higher than the amount actually received.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Freedom of Association&mdash;Part XA of the WR Act</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill ensures that an agreement may not be certified when it includes a provision inconsistent with the freedom of association provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. This provision is required primarily because some unions are seeking to include preference clauses in agreements. The freedom of association provisions of the act prohibit discrimination based on membership or non&hyphen;membership of a union, and render preference clauses void and of no effect. However, some unions still cling to the past and want such clauses included in certified agreements. Leaving aside the futility of such an exercise, there is a real risk that some employers and employees may mistakenly take these void clauses at face value, disadvantaging employees and breaching the act in the process. It is therefore essential that agreements containing preference clauses are not certified and, for the same reasons, provisions in existing awards and agreements which breach the freedom of association provisions should be removed. Provision is therefore also made for awards and agreements to be varied, on application, to remove void preference clauses.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Registered Organisations&mdash;Part IX of the WR Act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also amends the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act dealing with disamalgamation of organisations. As presently drafted, the definitions provision relating to withdrawal from an amalgamated organisation refers to only one of the two methods by which organisations could amalgamate under the act and, as a consequence, it has unintentionally excluded some organisations and branches from access to disamalgamation. The bill corrects this defect to ensure that the disamalgamation scheme will be able to operate as it was intended. The bill also makes provision to allow an application for a disamalgamation ballot made before the amendments take effect to proceed without the need to reapply to the Federal Court.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The restructure of the Australian Wheat Board brings to fruition a process dating back to 1989 aimed at putting ownership and control of wheat marketing firmly in growers' hands. This will enable industry to control its own future without the restrictions of government control and regulation. I am pleased to acknowledge that the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board has been driven by the grains industry.The push for change started in 1989, when industry commenced building up funds for a capital base for a future grower&hyphen;owned Australian Wheat Board via a levy on wheat sales, paid into the wheat industry fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1991 at the Grains 2000 conference, industry, through the Grains Council of Australia, recognised that the Australian Wheat Board needed greater flexibility to be best able to respond to changes in international marketing in order to compete successfully and maximise returns to growers. Further, the industry acknowledged that a marketing structure that is fully commercially driven is best achieved if it is owned and controlled by industry rather than by government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1992, the wheat industry entered into a compact with the then government for change. Specifically, the industry agreed that government underwriting of Australian Wheat Board borrowings should cease in 1999 and for the wheat industry fund to continue to be built up over that period towards a target figure of between $500 million and $550 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was decided that $500 million to $550 million would provide sufficient backing for the Australian Wheat Board to borrow the funds it requires to make harvest payments to growers without a government guarantee. It would also fund other Australian Wheat Board activities such as domestic grain trading and value adding activities in grain storage and processing overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At Grains Week in April 1996, industry and government agreed that wheat marketing arrangements post&hyphen;1999 should be based on the objectives of grower ownership and control, self&hyphen;reliance and a fully commercial approach to marketing. At that same time, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) asked industry to develop a plan which would ensure that this goal would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To assist in this, a Grains Council of Australia, Australian Wheat Board and Department of Primary Industries and Energy working group was formed to facilitate industry consideration of possible restructuring. The membership of the group included representatives from all Grains Council of Australia state affiliate organisations so that growers would have the opportunity to put forward their views. Further, to provide stability throughout the restructuring process, the government reiterated its commitment to retain the export monopoly and for the national competition policy review to be delayed until 1999&hyphen;2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After much consultation and deliberation, in March 1997 the working group put to government an agreed framework for a new structure. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is pleased that the government has readily been able to accept this framework, which he announced at Grains Week in April 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1 July 1999, wheat marketing will be undertaken not by the current statutory Australian Wheat Board but by a grower owned and controlled company operating under Corporations Law. The company will assume responsibility for all commercial aspects of wheat marketing, including financing and operation of wheat pools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new organisation will comprise a holding company with two subsidiaries: a pooling subsidiary and a domestic trading subsidiary. Shares in the holding company will be issued in two classes: one A&hyphen;class share will be issued to each grower and the wheat industry fund will be converted to B&hyphen;class shares and B&hyphen;class shares will be issued to wheat industry fund equity holders on the basis of one share for every unit in the wheat industry fund and will provide the company's capital base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A&hyphen;class shares will be issued only to wheat growers. They will be non&hyphen;transferable and redeemed as holders leave the industry or fail to qualify as a wheat grower. A&hyphen;class shares will confer voting rights to elect the majority of directors of the holding company, and  hence control of the holding company. They 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6475"> will not attract dividends or other returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the providers of equity, B&hyphen;class shareholders will have the right to elect a minority of directors. B&hyphen;class shareholders will receive a commercial rate of return and B&hyphen;class shares will only be tradeable amongst growers until the outcome of the national competition policy review of the export monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To achieve this structure by 1 July 1999, the restructuring of the Australian Wheat Board will require legislative change in two stages, now and in 1998. This bill represents stage 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before outlining in detail the key elements of the bill, so that there can be no doubt, let me make clear that the amendments contained in this bill in no way threaten the security of the export monopoly&mdash;it will continue to be enshrined in the legislation. The export monopoly is a fundamental part of both National Party policy and coalition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until 30 June 1999, responsibility for the export monopoly will rest with the Australian Wheat Board. Thereafter, the export monopoly will continue to be provided for in legislation. An independent regulatory mechanism will also be established to manage and monitor the performance of the export monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning now to the bill itself, it addresses the following key areas: the transitional provisions to apply until 30 June 1999; the cessation of the wheat industry fund levy in 1999; and, the composition of the board of the Australian Wheat Board.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Transitional Provisions to Apply Until 30 June 1999</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In broad terms, the transitional provisions of the bill provide for the redistribution of current Australian Wheat Board functions between the Australian Wheat Board, a new holding company, and two subsidiaries&mdash;a pooling and domestic trading subsidiary. In the bill, the companies are referred to as `Company A', `Company B' and `Company `C' respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The holding company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Australian Wheat Board. It will be this company which in 1999 will become the grower owned and controlled company, with a capital base provided by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wheat industry fund and distributed as shares to growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the new company structure is to allow the holding company, as the future grower owned company, to develop an operational and financial track record over the next two years. It will be able to develop its own identity in international capital markets so that it can be competitive in the marketplace for borrowing in its own right for its activities from 1 July 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The structure also addresses a key concern of growers by providing for a distinct separation of wheat pooling activities from other trading activities. The objective is for the holding company and its associated subsidiaries to be operational by 1 October 1997 to allow the future grower owned company the maximum amount of time possible to develop a track record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1 October 1997, the operating functions of the Australian Wheat Board will be reduced. In essence, the primary functions of the Australian Wheat Board will be management of the export monopoly, management of the wheat industry fund, and overseeing the activities of its subsidiary, the holding company. The Australian Wheat Board will be accountable to both industry and parliament for performance of these functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The holding company will be a commercial company operating under Corporations Law. It will assume the overarching responsibility for the pooling and commercial operations of the current Australian Wheat Board, including trade in wheat and grain and value adding activities. The pooling operations will be carried out by company B. The bill provides for the holding company to undertake borrowings, on behalf of its pools subsidiary, for the purpose of pool related payments, with such borrowings to be guaranteed by the Commonwealth until 1999. The holding company will also establish a domestic trading subsidiary, company C, to carry out the grain trading functions currently undertaken by the Australian Wheat Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of other details relating to the holding company and its subsidiaries, including their memorandum and articles of associa tion, are yet to be settled by industry, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6476"> future owners of the companies. To meet the expected 1 October 1997 commencement date, industry is working to a strict timetable. Government, however, as the guarantor of the pool related borrowings until 1999, must also be satisfied with the fine detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure that the wheat industry fund reaches its target of $550 million in 1999 and provides a sound capital base for the new company, the tax provisions of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 will continue to apply. Specifically, the operations of the Australian Wheat Board, the wheat industry fund and the pooling subsidiary will continue to be free from income tax until 30 June 1999. However, consistent with the government's competitive neutrality policy, normal income tax arrangements will apply to non&hyphen;pooling activities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Cessation of the wheat industry fund levy</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for the cessation of the wheat industry fund component of the levy on 30 June 1999. The wheat industry fund now stands at around $430 million, and there is a possibility it could exceed $550 million in mid 1999 if current strong prices and production levels continue. The financial consultants advise that the wheat industry fund of $550 million would allow the new company to fund the current range and level of services provided by the Australian Wheat Board. The second phase of legislative change, to be introduced in 1998, will provide that on 1 July 1999, ten years after the commencement of the wheat industry fund, equity in the fund will be transferred to growers, the rightful owners, in the form of B class shares in the holding company.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Composition of the Board of the Australian Wheat Board</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for amendment to various sections of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 relating to the Board of the Australian Wheat Board. Specifically, current members will continue to serve on the board until November 1998, when their present term of appointment expires. Thereafter, the bill provides for the appointment of not more than 11 members to the board. In light of the reduced functions of the Australian Wheat Board from 1 Octo 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ber 1997, and to provide maximum flexibility in the appointments process in November 1998, the bill does not specify the actual size of the board, only a maximum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, given that there will be only a seven&hyphen;month period during which new members will need to be appointed, a selection committee process will not be required. The rationale behind this is simply to minimise the costs, ultimately borne by growers, associated with appointments. However, in making appointments to the board, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy must consult with industry, through the President of the Grains Council of Australia. In keeping with the current legislation, the minister must also ensure that among the members there is a balance of skills in the areas of production, marketing and finance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final step towards a Corporations Law company under grower ownership and control will be taken in 1998 by way of a second package of legislation. The primary focus of the legislation will be the transfer of the wheat industry fund into growers' hands, its rightful owners. It will also provide for the stripping away of all the commercial provisions for wheat marketing which will not be needed after an independent, grower owned company assumes these functions in 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thereafter, the restrictive, paternalistic role of government will cease and the destiny of the industry will be placed firmly in growers' hands. From 1 July 1999, the industry will stand on its own two feet. The only government involvement will be in relation to the export monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments contained in this bill, and those to be introduced next year, finalise the restructure of wheat marketing and will stand industry in good stead for the future as an internationally competitive industry which continues to make a significant contribution to the Australian and rural economies. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are two bills in the legislation package which will corporatise the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;Electric Authority: the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997; and the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997. The Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997 gives effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments to establish a new company to operate and maintain the Snowy Mountains scheme&mdash;Snowy Hydro Limited. The Snowy Hydro Corporatisation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 repeals and amends various acts of parliament arising from the termination of the existing legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation complements corporatisation legislation introduced into the New South Wales parliament on 29 May 1997 and legislation expected to be introduced into the Victorian parliament in September 1997. The Snowy Mountains authority cannot be corporatised until all three pieces of legislation have been proclaimed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most Australians would be aware that the Snowy scheme is an integrated water and hydro&hyphen;electric power project situated in the Kosciusko National Park. Through a unique and complex example of engineering technology water is diverted west to the Murray and Murrumbidgee river systems for irrigation, producing renewable electricity through a complex integrated infrastructure which includes 16 major dams, seven power stations, 145 kilometres of interconnected tunnels and 80 kilometres of aqueducts. The Snowy scheme is the largest supplier of renewable energy in mainland Australia. Hydro power is truly `green power', which does not produce the emissions associated with coal or gas, and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there are strong indications that renewable power may attract a premium in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been consistent support for corporatisation of the Snowy scheme by successive Commonwealth and state governments for a number of very good reasons. The most significant is to ensure that the benefits of competition reform in Australia's electricity industry can be accessed by the Snowy scheme. The electricity industry is a very large and important sector, with assets of well over $50 billion and some 45,000 employees. Its annual sales to 7.8 million customers raised $12 billion in revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Electricity is a key input for all Australian industries, accounting for between five and 30 per cent of input costs. Over the past two decades, electricity use has increased by some five per cent a year. Structural and competition reforms in the electricity supply industry have the potential to reduce electricity prices to industrial users by over 25 per cent and thereby enhance Australia's international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the importance of improving efficiencies in this industry, governments have worked co&hyphen;operatively to introduce a competitive electricity market in southern and eastern Australia. The Snowy scheme is already important in the overall electricity market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the scheme provides only five per cent of New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian energy output, it has a number of unique strengths. It is a rapid response electricity generator which can specialise in providing peak power to the market. It has an important reserve capacity role which provides insurance to the whole industry, because the Snowy can respond instantly to cover the sudden loss of large coal and gas fired generating units. In particular, in the event of a complete or partial grid blackout, the Snowy provides a `black start' service of restarting the electrical system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national market has recently commenced. Competitive trading arrangements will evolve progressively as the market develops, with the transition to a fully competitive national market expected to be completed by the year 2000. The commencement of the market has served to highlight that an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6478"> important contribution to the development of the national market will be the creation of a competitive Snowy generator, which will provide a greater depth of competition to other generators, and the separation of the Snowy's current transmission business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under its current legislation, the Snowy scheme is precluded from operating commercially in the national market. While New South Wales and Victoria have responded to the introduction of the competitive market by establishing a company to trade electricity entitlements from the Snowy scheme, this does not allow the pricing arrangements enshrined in the current legislation to be varied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Presently, the operating costs of the authority are met by the electricity authorities of New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT, with no retained earnings. The current legislation requires that electricity is charged for at net cost of production, regardless of the prevailing market price. This does not allow the Snowy to maximise its output of high priced peak power. Corporatisation will allow the scheme to change from cost based to profit based operations. There are other important reasons to reform the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dual management system which currently governs the operations of the Snowy scheme has become outdated and inefficient. The Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;Electric Authority, a Commonwealth Statutory Authority, has responsibility for the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day management of operations. The Snowy Mountains Council, which directs the operations of the Snowy scheme's electricity generation, as well as water storage and release operations, comprises representatives from New South Wales and Victorian electricity and water bodies, and the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This two&hyphen;tier decision making process does not provide the single management focus necessary to take Snowy forward as a competitive and efficient trader of energy services in the national electricity market. When this legislation is proclaimed, governance of the scheme will transfer to a chairman and chief executive officer and a board of directors operating under corporations law and as set 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down in its memorandum and articles of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, corporatisation will enable the accelerated repayment to the Commonwealth of advances provided to fund the construction of the scheme. This debt to the Commonwealth has a face value of $820 million and a current value of around $740 million. Without reform the debt would not be fully repaid until the year 2027.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, some public concern has been expressed that corporatisation of the Snowy scheme will establish a corporate entity which is then capable of being privatised. It is acknowledged that the Victorian government&mdash;which has largely privatised its electricity supply industry&mdash;has publicly indicated its intention to privatise its Snowy entitlement as soon as possible. The NSW government has recently also stated its intention to privatise its electricity industry undertakings, including its 58 per cent share of the Snowy scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth government supports the corporatisation and privatisation of publicly owned electricity generators, distributors and transmission systems. We are investigating options to sell the Commonwealth's 13 per cent equity in the Snowy to Victoria or NSW to simplify the governance arrangements when the scheme is corporatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether or not the Commonwealth sells its equity, the future ownership of the scheme will be finally determined by the major equity shareholders&mdash;NSW and Victoria. The Commonwealth has therefore placed a high priority on ensuring that the arrangements to corporatise the scheme recognise the community interests in the future of the Snowy scheme. This interest is many faceted, reflecting the scheme's location in a national park, its significance as part of Australia's multicultural heritage; as well as its role as a significant source of the irrigation water on which our agricultural sector is so dependent. Regardless of the future ownership arrangements for the scheme these interests must be properly acknowledged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key element of the legislation package is the schedule to the explanatory memorandum, which contains the corporatisation principles 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6479"> agreed between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments. These principles, which provide the framework for corporatisation, deal with the critical areas agreed between governments before legislation could be developed. These include: the formation, equity holdings, corporate governance and staffing arrangements for the company; water arrangements for the company; the establishment of a water inquiry to examine environmental flows in rivers in the scheme's catchments; the regulatory arrangements which will be imposed on the company by the New South Wales government; and the company's liability for taxation and state tax compensation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the corporatisation principles Snowy Hydro Limited will assume the authority's debt to the Commonwealth. The three governments are committed to the refinancing of the Commonwealth's debt in the Snowy scheme shortly after corporatisation. The Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments have agreed that Snowy Hydro Limited will be incorporated in New South Wales, as this is where the Snowy scheme is geographically situated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle purposes of Snowy Hydro Limited will be to: generate electrical energy and market that energy and related services on a strictly commercial basis in the national electricity market; operate on a financially viable basis and in accordance with corporate plans approved by its members; and to undertake any future developments and operations that are commercially viable and that are agreed by the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Snowy Hydro Limited will be the sole employer for the scheme and all Snowy Mountains Authority staff will be offered the opportunity to transfer to the company. Those who do transfer to the company will carry over their Commonwealth superannuation schemes and various other accrued entitlements. Access to Commonwealth superannuation schemes will continue until such time as government ownership ceases. At that stage Commonwealth superannuation benefits may be preserved. Wages and conditions of service will also be carried over to the new corporation. Future changes to future wages and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conditions can be subsequently negotiated under the government's new industrial relation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I have already alluded to the Snowy scheme's importance as a water supplier to inland Australia. By diverting water west of the great dividing range, the Snowy scheme plays an important role in agricultural production and river management, including flood mitigation, flow augmentation during drought and the control of salinity in the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers. To achieve this, water has been diverted from other river systems, such as the Snowy River. The community is now questioning whether the development of the Snowy scheme adequately acknowledged the impact of reduced flows in other rivers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the broader level, the Council of Australian Governments agreed to a process for water industry reform in Australia at its meeting on 11 April 1995. Of particular relevance to the corporatisation of the Snowy scheme is the agreement by governments that the environment is a legitimate user of water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments have taken these concepts seriously. A water inquiry is to be held before the scheme is corporatised. The inquiry will examine issues arising from the current pattern of water flows in the rivers and streams within and flowing from the Snowy Mountains area, resulting from the operation of the scheme. The Commonwealth has agreed that New South Wales and Victoria, as the two states which have principal responsibility for Snowy scheme water management, will jointly sponsor the public inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry will be conducted by a single commissioner, appointed by NSW and Victoria and will report within six months, followed by a two month period to agree to a final outcome. Corporatisation legislation will be finalised in all three parliaments following the states' agreement on the outcome. Any outcome on environmental flows can only be determined in light of the finding of the water inquiry. The inquiry will allow the views of all interested parties to be considered&mdash;irrigators, environmental interests and other downstream users of water. Until then, there is no valid basis on which govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6480"> ments can take any action to alter water allocations from the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments have been unfairly accused of taking no notice of calls for increased environmental flows for the Snowy River. To respond only to the views of one interested group in advance of a public water inquiry&mdash;particularly by legislating for environmental flows in the Snowy River&mdash;would clearly disenfranchise other legitimate interests in the inquiry from the decision making process. Governments have not been prepared to do this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important that the potential financial impacts of any changed water arrangements impacting on Snowy Hydro Limited be identified before the corporatisation legislation is proclaimed. This will ensure that the company is established on a sound commercial basis and can operate in the competitive national electricity market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, there are other environmental aspects to the scheme's location in Kosciuszko National Park. Following corporatisation, Snowy Hydro Limited will be subject to New South Wales environmental and planning law. To comply with the existing New South Wales regulatory regime, the company will be required to prepare a corporate environmental management plan, which establishes minimum environmental standards, remediation programs, performance targets, management controls and compliance checks and timetables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within the KNP, the sensitivity of the alpine environment and conservation status of the park means that it will not be sufficient for Snowy Hydro Limited to simply operate in accordance with the normal New South Wales environmental regulatory regime. After Corporatisation, Snowy Hydro Limited's continued operation of the national park will be through a New South Wales lease and licence, which will contain enforcement provisions in respect of a KNP environmental management plan. Snowy Hydro Limited also has significant incentive to ensure that its environmental performance is impeccable, as it will be entering the market as a provider of `clean, green energy'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package of measures is designed to formally take the Snowy Mountains scheme into the competitive national electricity market. It is essential that this step be taken to provide important and necessary competition and to reform the corporate governance of the scheme. In so doing, the government is confident that the new arrangements safeguard the important environment and conservation status of the KNP and can address any potential impact that may have occurred regarding the Snowy River. I commend the bill to the honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

Entitlement to both child&hyphen;care assistance and the child&hyphen;care rebate will be calculated at the same time; families who are eligible for both types of payments will only need to lodge a single claim to receive both payments. The agency will make child&hyphen;care assistance payments fortnightly in advance to service operators based on family entitlements. The child&hyphen;care rebate will be paid fortnightly in arrears to the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, these new arrangements strengthen parents' right to choose the care they want for their children by giving families more control and responsibility. The value of child&hyphen;care subsidies will be more readily apparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides families with access to review and appeals mechanisms concerning decisions about their eligibility for child&hyphen;care payments, a right they have not previously enjoyed. This initiative assists small business by reducing the amount of administrative paperwork required from service providers to claim child&hyphen;care assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the government's child&hyphen;care initiatives announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget are the result of extensive family research and consultations with the community and industry. Many areas of Australia have too many child&hyphen;care centres while families in other areas have little or no access. This bill introduces a measure to limit the provision of new places to 7,000 per year over the next two years to ensure that all new long day care centre places are located in areas where demand for work related care is highest. This limit is consistent with the growth in work force participation of parents with young children. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6482">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill introduces a 20&hyphen;hour a week limit on access to child&hyphen;care assistance for each child in care for non&hyphen;work related purposes. This measure ensures Commonwealth funds are more efficiently targeted to the primary objective of the program, that is, work related care. Work related care is defined as care required by families where both parents are or the single parent is working, looking for work, studying or training. It includes families where one parent is working and the other, because of a disability, is unable to have work related commitments or care for their child or children. There will also be exemptions for children at risk of neglect or abuse, for operators where they are the sole provider of care in an area and for certain service types including occasional care services and rural multifunctional services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are serious disparities in financial assistance for the care of school aged children. Major reforms in school aged care will dramatically improve equity and affordability for an estimated 70,000 low and middle income families using outside school hours care services by providing higher levels of child&hyphen;care assistance to eligible families. This will increase the capacity of families to make choices about their care arrangements based on preference rather than on the level of subsidies available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, this bill provides the framework for refocusing the provision of child care so that its primary objective can be achieved: to facilitate the participation of parents with young children in the work force. It strikes a balance between the needs of parents and service providers and the need to ensure that subsidies are provided in the most efficient and effective way possible. It streamlines the administration and delivery of child&hyphen;care payments for both parents and service providers by providing one point of contact, the new Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of the bill is to put in place arrangements for the provision of general revenue assistance to the states and territories in 1997-98. The bill also includes provisions relating to the payment by states and territories of their share of the agreed 1997-98 fiscal contributions to the Commonwealth, and national competition payments by the Commonwealth in 1997-98. The contents of the bill are consistent with decisions taken at the 1997 Premiers Conference and related agreements with the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will amend the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994. The existing act covers the provision of financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance for 1996-97 only, with interim arrangements for the continuation of payments for a maximum of six months. The bill extends for a further 12 months the provisions of the existing act relating to the payment of financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general revenue assistance to be appropriated by this bill is about $16.8 billion, or around 12 per cent of estimated Commonwealth outlays in 1997-98. Accordingly, these payments constitute a significant element of the Commonwealth budget and have an important bearing on the spending and borrowing of the public sector as a whole. The states and territories are able to allocate the funds provided by the Commonwealth under this act according to their own budgetary priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997 Premiers Conference agreed that the states and territories will be provided with real per capita growth in financial assistance 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6483"> grants in 1997-98 and that the real per capita guarantee for financial assistance grants will be extended to 1999-2000. Amendments to the act are consistent with the per capita element of the real per capita guarantee being conditional on states meeting the terms of the agreement to implement the national competition policy and related reforms. This agreement also provides for the commencement of $214.7 million in competition payments to the states and territories in 1997-98. The Commonwealth will consider the views of the National Competition Council when determining if a state should receive the payments provided under the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the 1997 Premiers Conference it was decided that the states and territories would make fiscal contribution payments of $626.5 million in 1997-98 and $313.5 million in 1998-99. It was also agreed that half of the scheduled 1997-98 fiscal contributions of Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory will be deferred until 1998-99 in recognition of their difficult economic circumstances. The need for the 1998-99 fiscal contribution will be reviewed at the 1998 Premiers Conference in light of developments in the Commonwealth's fiscal position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth will continue to provide states and territories with maximum flexibility concerning the method of payment of the state fiscal contributions. A state's share can be paid by way of deductions from general revenue assistance, direct payments to the Commonwealth or a reduction in funding provided under a specific purpose grant. Provisions have been included in the bill for states' 1997-98 fiscal contributions to be deducted from general revenue assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major part of the assistance provided under this bill is the provision to each state and territory of a share of the pool of financial assistance grants which is estimated to be about $16.1 billion in 1997-98. In accordance with the agreement at the 1996 Premiers Conference, this amount includes the grants that were previously paid to the states as arterial road grants. The 1997 Premiers Conference agreed that the distribution of financial assistance grants should be in ac 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cordance with the per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The bill updates the per capita relativities in the act accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill authorises the payment of special revenue assistance to New South Wales and Victoria of $435.5 million in 1997-98 as payments under the guarantee arrangements associated with the medicare agreements. The Commonwealth will fund $62.2 million of these payments and the residual will be funded from the financial assistance grants pool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Capital Territory will also receive $34.5 million from the Commonwealth in 1997-98 in the form of transitional allowances and special fiscal needs. This payment is outside the scope of this bill and has been included in the appropriation bills.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Thin capitalisation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will amend the tax law to improve the effectiveness of the thin capitalisation rules in order to ensure that an appropriate amount of profit is derived in Australia in respect of foreign controlled Australian enterprises. The thin capitalisation foreign debt to foreign equity gearing ratio will be reduced from 3:1 to 2:1 for taxpayers who are not financial institutions. The gearing ratio for financial institutions will remain unchanged at 6:1.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6484">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To complement the new gearing ratio, the definition of foreign debt for companies that are not financial institutions will be extended to borrowings from overseas lenders for which a guarantee has been provided by a foreign controller or their non&hyphen;resident associates or such debt secured against the assets of a foreign controller or their non&hyphen;resident associates. This extension of foreign debt will not apply where a resident company can establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Taxation that the loan could have been obtained without the guarantee or security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition of foreign equity for fixed trusts will be calculated on the basis of their foreign controllers' fixed interests in the capital and net income of the trust. Discretionary trusts will be denied an income tax deduction for interest paid to foreign controllers or their non&hyphen;resident associates. For partnerships the foreign equity will be based on the interest that the foreign partners have in the capital and income of the partnership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also contains measures to counter avoidance arrangements. Asset revaluations for partnerships and trusts will be limited to market value changes. The provisions dealing with back to back arrangements will be repealed as it is considered that the general anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions of the income tax law will be more effective in countering such arrangements. A foreign controller of a partnership or trust will be denied a deduction for loans from a non&hyphen;resident associate which is invested as either debt or equity in the partnership or trust respectively.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Finance shares</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will amend the income tax law to address tax avoidance arrangements involving eligible finance shares and widely distributed finance shares. In February the government announced measures denying non&hyphen;portfolio dividend status and eligibility for an underlying foreign tax credit on dividends paid on eligible finance shares and widely distributed finance shares. These provisions give effect to that announcement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Group certificates for employees ceasing employment</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, in his statement dated 24 March 1997 and contained in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS>, announced a proposal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> designed to reduce employers' compliance costs by removing the requirement on employers to always issue group certificates within seven days for employees who cease working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends the law relating to group certificates to generally allow employers to issue group certificates by 14 July after the end of the relevant year of income unless an employee who leaves employment during the year makes a written request for their group certificate at an earlier date. The amendment will not, however, affect the obligation of an employer to issue a certificate within seven days when making an eligible termination payment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Tax exempt entities that become taxable</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also proposes amendments to overcome deficiencies identified in the existing law. The proposed amendments will ensure that where a tax exempt entity becomes taxable: the entity is allowed a deduction for any surplus in its defined benefit superannuation scheme; the entity is allowed a deduction for contributions made in arrears after the transition time where the defined benefit superannuation scheme was in surplus at the transition time; and the doubtful debt provision for debts existing immediately before the transition time, for which no deduction is allowable, is reduced where such a debt is sold at or after the transition time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Measures to address tax avoidance through tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, the Treasurer announced that the government intended to introduce legislation to counter tax avoidance through the use of tax&hyphen;exempt bodies distributing funds offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of this government's commitment to undertake consultation before introducing legislation into parliament, an exposure draft of this legislation together with explanatory notes were released on 20 February 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, it should be emphasised that under both the exposure draft and the legislation now before the parliament, any distribution of funds received from donations, gifts, offerings, `plate money' and the like will not affect an organisation's tax exempt status.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6485">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the charitable trust provisions are of an anti&hyphen;avoidance nature, the government has, where possible, adopted a number of suggestions made by interested parties to ensure as far as possible that bona fide organisations will not lose their tax exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to other tax exempt organisations covered by provisions in the bill, the government has also amended the wording of the proposed legislation to make it perfectly clear that organisations based in Australia will not be affected by these measures as long as they incur their expenditure and pursue their objects principally in Australia. This amendment specifically addresses the concerns of a large number of representations received by the government on the draft legislation, including from many religious, missionary and sporting organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with the announcement by the previous government, the charitable trust measures will take effect after the commencement of charitable trusts' 1996&hyphen;97 year of income. The measures affecting other exempt organisations will apply from the 1996-97 budget announcement as previously announced.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Quasi&hyphen;ownership of fixtures/leases of luxury cars</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two measures in the bill which relate to the tax law improvement project. The first measure ensures that luxury car leasing rules in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 continue to have application to the 1997&hyphen;98 and later income years. The second incorporates into the rewritten 1997 assessment act rules which treat a lessor of depreciable plant under a chattel lease as the owner for taxation depreciation purposes where the plant has become a fixture on another person's land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Electronic lodgment and electronic funds transfers</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will amend the income tax law and fringe benefits tax law to provide for electronic lodgment of returns, applications for amendment and other documents provided to the commissioner. These amendments give legislative effect to what is a current administrative practice for taxpayers who lodge through tax agents. The amendments will also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enable other taxpayers to lodge these documents by electronic transmission to the commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments will be made to allow the commissioner to pay refunds by electronic funds transfer to any account nominated by the taxpayer. The account may be an account of another person.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Rate of tax for friendly societies</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1997-98 budget the government announced that, in keeping with the competition objectives of the financial system inquiry that reported in March 1997, it would recommence the review of the taxation treatment of life insurance that was initiated in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget, but not completed by the former government prior to the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure that the present taxation treatment of friendly societies is undisturbed for the duration of the review, the rate of tax imposed on the life insurance business of friendly societies will be retained at 33 per cent for the 1997-98 and 1998-99 income years. Similarly, the rebate available to policyholders who receive assessable bonuses on life insurance policies issued by friendly societies will be retained at 33 per cent for the 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 income years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trustee rate will be increased to 39 per cent from 1999-2000 and the rebate rate will be increased to 39 per cent from 2000-01 unless other relevant amendments to the taxation treatment of friendly societies are made prior to that time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been a bad couple of weeks for the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser). I am beginning to think that the pressure is starting to affect the standard of his work as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Late last week the minister responded to a question I had on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> regarding the amount of heroin being imported into Australia. I asked the minister if it was possible for him to provide an estimate of the amount of heroin being seized by the authorities as a percentage of the total amount entering the country. To my complete and utter surprise, the minister said he was not able to provide such an estimate. The minister must have been too preoccupied with his business matters and his meetings with Bunbury City councillors not to be able to come up with such figures. I was not asking for precise details, just an estimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only worthwhile information the minister for small business was able to provide me was the following. I quote from his answer to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Customs Service is responsible for the detection and seizure action in relation to drugs detected at the border. From 1 July 1996 to 3 June 1997, the Australian Customs Service has made 60 heroin seizures totalling 153.1 kilograms.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I thank the minister for that tidbit of data, but I would like to draw his attention to two quite well-known pieces of information regarding the estimated amount of heroin being detected coming into Australia as a percentage of the total amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, while investigating the link be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tween drugs and crime in 1989, estimated that only about 17 per cent of heroin imported for consumption into Australia is seized. That is one well&hyphen;known estimate the minister could have referred had he been doing his job properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now let me refer to the second figure the minister should have realised, because it was certainly at his fingertips. Just last year, in December, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence released the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">1995-96 Australian Illicit Drug Report</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and a very informative, albeit depressing, report it is. It says on page 62 that only 10 per cent of the heroin entering Australia is being seized.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that is another figure to which the minister could have referred in his answer to me, but he chose not to. The minister, hunkered down in his office, with calls for his resignation on the left of him and calls for his resignation on the right, quite clearly has not got his mind on the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, one positive did spring from the answer given to me by the minister. If we are to believe the accuracy of the estimates provided by the Joint Standing Committee on the NCA and the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, that only 10 or 17 per cent of all the heroin entering Australia is actually being seized, and if, as the Minister says, 153 kilograms of heroin was picked up by Australian Customs over the last 11 months, that means the other 83 to 90 per cent&mdash;roughly between 747 and 1,377 kilograms of heroin&mdash;is still out there; that is, if it hasn't already gone into the bruised arms of addicts in my electorate and heaven knows where else around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an enormous amount of heroin which has slipped past the authorities. That is an enormous amount of heroin being sold on the streets of Cabramatta, Footscray, Inala, Northbridge and elsewhere. That is an enormous amount of heroin that we as a society will remain powerless to stop until we turn our `war' on heroin away from simply focusing on supply and concentrate on the demand that brings the drug into the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Moore (Mr Filing) has quite vividly described the holes that have developed in the Customs Service because of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6488"> the government's budget cuts&mdash;videotape from closed circuit cameras being watched days after shipments of goods have arrived and X&hyphen;ray equipment only being used on  cargo leaving the country, not entering it. However, I think it must be said that we could have the largest, most efficient customs service in the world and heroin would still be finding its way onto our shores undetected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well fighting the supply of heroin but, as long as demand for it exists in our communities, our young people will continue crucifying themselves on the ends of syringes across the country, from Moore in Western Australia to Prospect in my electorate of New South Wales and back again. We need to focus our attention on the demand for heroin that now exists in our country. Only when this is done will we start to see any positive effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will start to need less of the billions of dollars a year we spend incarcerating criminals for committing burglaries to feed their heroin habits; less for providing emergency health services for addicts overdosing in the streets of our suburbs; less for law enforcement and the judicial system fighting a war on drugs that they can never win as long as we follow the present strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister for small business has shown, with his answer to my question on notice, that he is out of touch when it comes to the heroin problem facing Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) have not got much of an idea either. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) supports the national drug strategy in public but we all know that behind closed doors he is convinced that we need change&mdash;if only he were not hamstrung by his desert&hyphen;dry, reactionary cabinet colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the minister for health takes his colleagues aside, especially the minister for small business, and has a word to them regarding the failings of the national drug strategy. With over a tonne of heroin coming into the country undetected in the last eleven months, it is pretty obvious that we are going nowhere fast.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight, with a mixture of sadness and pride, I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding senior naval officer and a great Australian, before his formal retirement from the Royal Australian Navy next Monday, 30 June. I speak of my brother Rod who retires at that time as Chief of the Navy after 43 years of dedicated, professional service in all ranks from cadet midshipman to Vice Admiral.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without being too parochial, as indeed I will not, and without undue family bias, can I say that Rod's career has been a series of firsts, always dominated by strong leadership, keen intellect, by his respect for others and the respect he earned from them, by unparalleled professionalism, a deep sense of loyalty and, in his senior ranks, an unswerving apolitical line in the best traditions of his service and the ADF.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Monday sees the end of an era in Australian naval history, as he is the last serving 13&hyphen;year&hyphen;old entry cadet.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one of the nation's foremost maritime navigational experts, he navigated worldwide everything from minesweepers to aircraft carriers during his sea service. Highlights of his career were many and varied, from Household Flag Lieutenant to the Queen Mother in the royal Yacht Britannia in 1963&hyphen;64 to later operational commands at sea in HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vampire</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torrens</EMPHASIS>, the latter as Commander of the third Australian destroyer squadron and as Commodore Afloat.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My major disappointment this evening is that our late parents are not with us to hear this formal acknowledgment of Rod's immense national contribution. I recall my mother's reaction when he and I, as youngsters, were fighting in the kitchen one evening. Her retort to Rod was `If you don't behave, I'll put you into the navy.' How right she was for all the wrong reasons. My other disappointment is that he has not been able to serve on. He is a very young 57.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this adjournment debate to bring to the attention of honourable members the activities of an incredibly committed and talented group of parents in the Blacktown&hyphen;Mount Druitt area. These parents are led by Ms Terry Driscoll and an enthusiastic management committee team. The organisation is the Blacktown&hyphen;Mount Druitt learning difficulties group. It provides a vital service to parents in this huge area with children who have a variety of learning difficulties. The group provides a marvellous library to assist parents as a resource. It provides monthly guest speakers to also give added help to parents. The coordinator, Terry Driscoll, is employed and paid for only 12 hours per week but in fact puts in many hours of unpaid time to the program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Terry travels to schools all over the area, speaking to parents and teachers, explaining the problems of children with learning difficulties and exposing the various symptoms of such children. Many children are not simply slow or naughty; they have real and genuine learning difficulties that are only now becoming exposed and identified to parents and teachers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The group I am referring to in this contribution is an example of foresightedness and dedication under great difficulties, and their success needs to be rewarded and broadcast widely. The members pay a small membership fee and pay a low rent in a community centre provided by the Blacktown City Council, which is a marvellous help. The New South Wales state government provides $22,000 per annum to cover salaries, running costs and other expenses. The expertise within this group is now widely recognised, and many local paediatricians are referring parents to the group for advice and assistance. The group has an enormous struggle to keep up with the demands being made on it and desperately needs more funds to try to service those demands.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6490">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only paediatricians refer parents to the group. Local community centres are also becoming aware of the expertise available and are referring clients. Schools are now sending parents to the group for assistance. All these things are putting great strain on the physical resources and stamina of Terry Driscoll, who  is the only employee. The management committee is an enthusiastic group of interested parents. They give great support to Terry Driscoll and the many other parents who come to the group for help and advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already noted that this group receives financial help from the state government and pays a reduced rent to the local city council. Following representations and discussions between the group and my office, I have been pleased to refer their issues to the federal Minister for Health and Family Services (Mrs Moylan). If a local regional officer can speak with this group, I am sure there will be a way to assist this worthwhile organisation somehow. Thus, we will achieve the support of the three tiers of Australian government in an area of need which, through a lack of knowledge that help should be given, has been neglected for far too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Children are Australia's most valuable commodity and asset. They far outstrip minerals and other assets that might be regarded as important for us in the future. Children are our future, and we need to ensure that everything possible is done to achieve maximum participation in our nation's future by all children. The Mount Druitt&hyphen;Blacktown learning difficulties group is doing its best through its work to try to meet the needs of all our children, who are valuable assets for the future of our country. With the help of the three tiers of government, groups such as this will succeed in their endeavours. But they do need our help, and we must help them now.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6490"><TITLE>Cyprus</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In about three weeks time&mdash;on 20 July, to be exact&mdash;the world will witness the 23rd anniversary of Turkey's illegal and bloody invasion and occupation of 37 per cent of Cyprus, with no sign from the Ankara government of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any contriteness or willingness to discuss the withdrawal of their 40,000&hyphen;strong military force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world must not forget this illegal act by Turkey. It is an illegal act which has been denounced by all freedom loving nations of the world. That denouncement extends to the government of Turkey which, as an independent and sovereign state member of the United Nations, seeks to create an image of moderation and peacefulness towards its neighbours. Whilst Turkey continues to occupy Cyprus, their credentials as a nation dedicated to peace, freedom and democracy are not to be believed. Thousands of Greek Cypriots remain refugees in their own country, prevented by military might from living in their homes and villages. Thousands more are still waiting for word on the fate of 1,619 loved ones missing since the summer of 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I visited Cyprus in August of last year and met many Greek Cypriots whose homes and possessions are gone&mdash;through Turkish confiscation. They were able to point out to me where their homes were prior to the bloody invasion by Turkish troops. In many instances, their homes could be seen&mdash;by the naked eye or, in some instances, through binoculars&mdash;in Turkish occupied territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cyprus remains forcibly divided, and a major concern of governments throughout the years has been to achieve its reunification in a way that will guarantee territorial integrity and security. It is important to note that the question of security has three aspects. The first is the complete demilitarisation of Cyprus, that is, the immediate withdrawal of an estimated 40,000 Turkish troops stationed in the occupied area. The second aspect is the creation of an international force&mdash;with a UN Security Council mandate&mdash;which will be able to intervene if the territorial integrity or independence of the country or the security of either community is threatened. The third aspect is the right of unilateral intervention of any of the guarantor powers, should that occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time that human rights for all Cypriots be restored, because it is clear that time works against Cyprus. The demographic composition 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6491"> of the island is continually changing, due to the deliberate influx of settlers or colonists from Turkey. The younger generations of the two communities are growing up without knowing one another and the fait accompli of the division is becoming further entrenched. It is also time that all illegal Turkish settlers withdraw from Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the attention of the parliament to the fact that the new UN Secretary General, Mr Kofi Annan, has invited Cyprus President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash, to hold face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face negotiations in New York from 9&hyphen;13 July. The Cyprus government has responded positively to the invitations, even though it would have preferred the negotiations to have been better prepared in advance and some common ground in narrowing the gap between the positions of the two sides to have been established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the Cyprus government has already reported that the Turkish Cypriot leader remained inflexible during the latest talks, sticking to the position he has held for the past 22 years. However, this round of negotiations should not end in failure as has happened repeatedly in the past because of the lack of political will from the Turkish side&mdash;a fact that has been documented by the United Nations. Failure would only increase the people's frustration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia could also play a role in making this round of talks a success. As a UN and Commonwealth member, the Australian government should propose concrete measures to be taken against Turkey's intransigence. Turkey should not be allowed to continue its blatant violation of human rights in Cyprus and, as a first step, Australia should demand the immediate withdrawal of the Turkish troops and settlers. Australia should also help the UN in convincing Turkey that it is in her best interests to solve the protracted Cyprus problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am absolutely convinced, following my visit to Cyprus, that the Greek Cypriots' aim is not to dominate. The aim of the Cyprus government is a united sovereign bi&hyphen;zonal bi&hyphen;communal federation in accordance with the principle of political equality as defined by the UN Secretary&hyphen;General and endorsed by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Security Council. This, of course, means effective participation in the different organs of the federal government and not equal numerical participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the Commonwealth government to do all that possibly can be done to grasp this opportunity to arrive at a just and lasting peaceful settlement in the interests of all legitimate Cypriots of Greek and Turkish origin, who lived together in peace and harmony for thousands of years and want to return to that harmony.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6491"><TITLE>Cyprus

When the occasion arises, I will be making a similar contribution to that issue and will be offering support for the resolution of the situation in Cyprus. Cyprus regrettably has been the pawn of the superpowers since the invasion by Turkey in 1974. I say that as one who had dear family friends who, on a return visit to Cyprus, were captured by the Turks in the invasion. They were Australian nationals, but that did not matter. They were still captured and, after some long negotiation by the Whitlam government, we were able to get them released&mdash;but their properties in Kyrenia and all that area of Cyprus have just become so degraded since then.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some months prior to the last election, I was approached by a number of small business people in my electorate, who had tenancies in large shopping centres, about the inequities, the intimidation and the hardships that they were suffering as tenants within those centres. Many of the tenants had become captives, and I commend the chairman of the committee that brought the fair trading report into the chamber, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). I compliment him and his colleagues on the fine report that they have brought back to this parliament. What brings merit to that report is that it is a unanimous report.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6492">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a great believer in the committee structure of this parliament, and I hope that unanimous report of that committee will result in effective action in the implementation of the recommendations. This is what the parliament can do. Parliament is not simply about the executive. Parliament is very much about the committee system, and if ever there was a report that merited this support of the executive and its carriage into law it is the report of this committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said to my constituents&mdash;those who are in business in large shopping centres such as Charlestown Square, Belmont City Centre, Lake Macquarie Fair and Garden City&mdash;that anyone, and I have issued this public warning on a number of occasions, who is contemplating tenancy in a large shopping centre should first seek independent legal and accounting advice on every aspect of what that tenancy may entail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen the sorry state of people who actually have taken their redundancy package and have unwittingly lost not only their redundancy package but also their home on top of it&mdash;everything they have got; the whole of their life savings and life assets. These were people who should never have been in business, but we have people desperate for employment on the one side and on the other all the professional advisers of the Property Council of Australia. I did not wake up till a few months ago to the fact that the Property Council of Australia actually was the major shopping centre proprietors of Australia. I read all those glossies and that was great, and it was only a few months ago that I came to realise whom they represented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I had here in the House Susanne Pinkney, Bill Roberts, Peter Frost, who is the president of the Small Business Persons Association of the Hunter, David Vickery, Wayne Brown and Rocky Gallucci. They are all small business people. I come from a small business background myself, albeit some time ago, but I very much empathise with them. I understand what they are going through. I have seen some of the tragedies and the family breakups that have arisen out of the disasters in which people have found themselves.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have time to get through the recommendations of the committee's report. I am one of the persons who did not get an opportunity to speak in the Main Committee. I was scheduled to speak after the Deputy Speaker this morning. I hope that opportunity raises its head again, because that report must be discussed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people I have just mentioned are down here to see the report's recommendations being discussed and debated. It is a bipartisan report that affects hundreds of thousands of small business people in this country, and we owe them the implementation of those recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me comment on the reference in the report to the renewal of leases or rather, firstly, to the uniform retail tenancy code. It is a must. We are an increasingly mobile society in business. There should be uniformity across Australia in legislation governing leases&mdash;the renewal of leases, the five&hyphen;year period and the option to renew for five years, and the recognition of goodwill. People go in and put in $250,000 of their money&mdash;as in a case that I have had put to me&mdash;sell up their premises, build up the business, and at the end of five years they are told, `Out, we have got somebody else.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again I rise to talk about the Fisheries Amendment Legislation Bill 1997. In my closing remarks yesterday, before the adjournment of the Main Committee, I spoke of the fine work of the Forum Fisheries Agency based in Honiara. In discussions with my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Andrew Thomson), it was interesting to hear him talk about an excursion in the second week of June, when he attended the Multilateral Conference on Highly Migratory Species held at Majura in the Marshall Islands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was impressive with this&mdash;as we start to look at the security and long&hyphen;term viability of our fish stocks and avoiding their over&hyphen;exploitation&mdash;is that the conference was able to negotiate an arrangement for the management of the stocks of tuna over the next three years by means of a declaration for the preservation of the species. Included in that declaration was the preservation and stock assessment of billfish. The species of tuna which they are addressing are the albacore, big&hyphen;eye and yellowfin tuna, and it is important that all people work together on this resource security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfortunate thing about fish stocks is that they cannot be measured like the cattle in a yard or the sheep in a paddock can be, because it is not known where the fish are at any particular time or how many there are in any specified area. We seem to know the levels only after the fact, once fish stocks are down. Australia has a great opportunity at the moment, and that opportunity is the continuing exportation of fish to offshore markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, a new company is developing markets for the exportation of fish, particularly the finer fishes, to overseas markets. Black Funnel Fisheries at Salamander Bay has been set up by a young chap, Mr Morgan, who is investing all that he has. One of his problems, as I discovered when we sat down and discussed exports, is that he is concerned about the long&hyphen;term security of being able to obtain fish stocks. Setting up an export facility is not something that is cheap to do, and breaking into offshore markets is not something that is easily managed. But the one thing that can destroy the credibility and long&hyphen;term viability of any exporter is a lack of fish resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge all parties to come to the front and look to the long&hyphen;term future of fisheries in Australia, and to consider the report that was tabled last week and map out and plan for the sustainable development and harvesting of our stocks. Let us not revisit any of the past excesses of overfishing, such as we saw with the southern bluefin and the orange roughy, but let us conserve our species of all fish. I commend the bill to the Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only heard the last three minutes of the speech of the member for Paterson (Mr Baldwin), but the main thrust of what he was saying was excellent, and I wish the person from his electorate who is going into exporting fish all the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6495"> best, because it is one of the things that Australia can do more of, and it is probably given to more exporting of its fish. Of course, in my area, we do that quite well with salmon&mdash;as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 is not opposed by the opposition and will be supported. Australian fisheries under the Commonwealth jurisdiction are managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, and a number of acts cover their responsibility. There are a number of minor issues needing correction, and they have been identified over the past four years, I understand; and these amendments rectify those issues that have been identified. The bill tidies up interpretations and definitions in some of the more complex areas, and will get over those issues with these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly the management of fisheries in Australia has been the subject of much discussion recently, particularly in the committee of which I am deputy chair&mdash;the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industry, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs. We brought down a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managing Commonwealth fisheries: the last frontier</EMPHASIS>. The phrase `the last frontier' gives the impression that there is a frontier and that there are still a lot of issues out there where things do not always fit together that well. When the recommendations from this report come in, I am sure there will be other amendments to the acts that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority will need to make, after consideration by government and by the minister, of course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many problems that surface in this industry. They are not easily dealt with because of the lack of information between governments&mdash;state and federal. The old act that was basically put in place by John Kerin when he was the minister for primary industries endeavoured to break some of the old links of ministerial influence, with people coming straight to the minister when there was a problem. I think this is the issue that we confront in the state legislation: there is still not enough room between the minister and the actual decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The setting up of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority by John Kerin under the Labor government endeavoured to set a distance between ministerial decision making and the actual management of the fisheries, therefore taking some of the politics out of it. That has worked reasonably well, but there are issues there that need to be addressed. There are many issues that have come through in the new report which will help tidy those things up and build on the strengths and the pluses that came out of that original model. I would recommend that the state fisheries and the state fisheries ministers, of whatever persuasion, have a look at trying to distance themselves a bit from the politics of the fishing industry. Then we may well get more, and better, direction and more sustainability in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many problems that have surfaced for this industry and, as I said, they are not easily dealt with. One of them is the swapping of information so that people have a good basis on which to make decisions. Some of these amendments make the management acts a bit clearer and more precise so that they enhance people's ability to understand what their responsibilities are, which is always a positive thing. We will have to go a little further in administering our fisheries and I think our report will certainly assist that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fishing is one of Australia's major resource industries. Certainly in Tasmania it makes up a goodly proportion of our income and provides thousands of jobs throughout our island. Yet there are arms within the industry that do not even talk to each other, let alone discuss the overall planning or the overall industry, and that means it lacks an ability to look into the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6496"> future. There are recommendations in our report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The last frontier</EMPHASIS>, which we would say would help us to get some more direction in that area, and I will touch on those in a little while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report recognises, as these amendments do, that when it comes to management, fish do not respect lines drawn in the water. They cross over between state and Commonwealth waters and there have to be specific management regimes to sort that out. Under the present regime, the Commonwealth has responsibility for certain fisheries and the states have responsibility for others. As I said earlier, some of the decision making process really has political overtones, from the state perspective, and we should try and keep away from that. I would urge the states to move away from that sort of environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One issue that needs to be addressed is by&hyphen;catch. This report&mdash;and I am sure amendments will come to the parliament some time in the future&mdash;deals with the by&hyphen;catch situations, where a certain amount of dumping takes place at sea when a catch is made of a species which is not targeted by the fisher. It may be quite a legitimate catch, but it might not have economic value to the fisher. The fisher who knows the price of that particular fish may wish to dump it and to shoot again for another species which will give him a bigger economic return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fisher may shoot his nets and catch a species which is prohibited, so he will dump those fish at sea. These catches never go into the logbooks, never come back to management and therefore are not part of the management of fisheries. This is an ongoing problem that has been with us since the year dot when we first started to have some sort of management regimes over fisheries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the recommendations in the House committee's report go to trying to get on top of these issues so that logbooks give a much truer picture and can be used as a management tool. We should encourage that. Those recommendations say that the authority should meet some of the costs of fishers landing those fish that they caught instead of dumping them, so that there would be some worthwhile economic return to them&mdash;pay them to bring those fish ashore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendation is that any surplus from that should go to fishing research. The fishers would at least be compensated for the cost of bringing those fish ashore, but it would not be a big enough incentive to make them target the fish that we may not want fished at that time. That would certainly give a bit more credibility to logbooks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a part of getting the fishers to have faith in fishing management. The feeling I have is that there is a stand&hyphen;off between the management authorities of the fisheries&mdash;whether they be state based or Commonwealth&mdash;and the fishers. The fishers stand off, not quite trusting the management authorities. On the other side, managers do not quite trust the information they get from all the fishers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of that has broken down at the Commonwealth level and possibly in some of the state areas, and that is excellent. If we can get the fishers to have faith in the management and the management to have faith in the fishers, a lot more information will be obtained which will be of great assistance to managing fisheries in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the very good recommendation in this report on the by&hyphen;catch will be taken up by the government in the future&mdash;especially looking at and utilising logbooks. The recommendation really goes to the surrender provisions and getting people to declare their by&hyphen;catch. This has been utilised in New Zealand, where it has been very successful, I understand, in getting them to get more credibility from their logbooks.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6497">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the recommendations in the report also go to recreational fishing; in particular, game fishing, charter boat operators and the general revenue that they generate, which is a considerable amount according to evidence from those fisheries. Also, of course, there are the common recreational fishermen who fish off the rocks around the coastlines or go out in boats in the estuaries or wherever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They take a considerable amount of fish which we do not have a lot of knowledge about. They certainly spend a lot of money on recreational fishing, whether it is on lures or fishing rods, fishing boats, fuel, caravans or accommodation or whatever. It has always been difficult to get an exact figure which has total credibility, but it is certainly a considerable amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the recommendations in the report suggests that there needs to be a change in the Fisheries Management Act to allow the management authority to take recreational fishing into consideration when managing the fisheries of the Commonwealth. It does that because you cannot have the amount of fish caught by recreational fishing not being given consideration in the overall management of the fishing stocks. I think that will be a generally accepted recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position of this industry is a reflection of the name of this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The last frontier</EMPHASIS>. Within this industry, a considerable number of cowboys still exist, if I can call them that. There are people at the frontier who still sometimes make their own rules and make decisions without giving consideration to the fisheries they are in. They do not always consider the future&mdash;the long&hyphen;term position&mdash;and they act a bit in a cowboy way in exploiting whatever they can, whenever they can, without really giving consideration to the long&hyphen;term management situation of the fishery in which they are fishing. That needs to be addressed. We really need to try to bring those people in, as I said earlier, so they will have some faith in management of fisheries, and then the management authorities may have some faith in them and in what they do in the fisheries in which they work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth and bringing together the constitutional issues with the swapping of information need to be addressed. The management of the fishery, whether it is a Commonwealth fishery or a state fishery, also needs to be decided, perhaps by considering one fishery at a time and not by packing them up together to make agreements to make them work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some other recommendations in our report in relation to CSIRO. The research vessel, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Southern Surveyor</EMPHASIS>, which works out of the CSIRO fishing laboratories in Hobart&mdash;at the end of Salamanca Place&mdash;I believe is certainly underutilised in the management of Australian fisheries. There are some recommendations that we should endeavour to make sure that we utilise this vessel, with the right priorities, in looking at the research needs and the knowledge that we need for the management of our fisheries. At the moment, sometimes this boat has to go to other countries to earn money so that it has enough money to continue its existence. I think there is enough work to be done in Australian fisheries to provide a bit more work for this vessel. There is a recommendation in the report that we should do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have dealt with the by&hyphen;catch and recreational issues. The main issue I want to deal with is that, because of the lack of knowledge and leadership within the national perspective of the fishing industry, there is a great need for the Australian Seafood Industry Council to be strengthened and able to build on a national basis. We are talking about having a national body which can deal with government at a national level because there are a lot of issues now from a national perspective in fishing that are becoming international as well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6498">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who is sitting opposite me and who sits on the treaties committee with me, realises this because we have been through the tuna treaty and the issues that are involved in tuna fishing in the Southern Ocean and in Australian waters. There is a need for a national body that will give a proper perspective. The fishing industry is not always perceived to be a good industry and it has some relatively bad press from time to time and so a national body would help counter some of that. Sometimes that press is not truthful and sometimes it is used to attack fishing and the fishing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of people in the fishing industry who are fishing quite legitimately and who are very supportive of their fisheries and of the management of the fisheries. They will work closely with the authorities to protect their industry and work for its long&hyphen;term future, and they endeavour to build new products. More of that probably needs to be done in the future. At present there is very little that is done in this industry which looks into long-term marketing situations for fish in our country and also overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry does have potential. There is potential in the Southern Ocean, but there is going to be a response to fishing in the Southern Ocean from people who believe that that area is going to be exploited by the world fishing nations as they try to reap in some of the catches that they cannot catch in other parts of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of problems in the Northern Hemisphere fisheries at the moment. Evidence that we received in our inquiry indicated that there is about 50 per cent overcapitalisation in the world's fishing fleets. There has been a lot of new technology introduced over the years and the efforts used to take fish out of the seas has increased enormously. Each country has added value to their boats to enable them to exploit the seas as much as they can, and that is coming to a head and needs to be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will certainly be supporting these amendments and I look forward to the government acting on our report in the future and bringing our management of fisheries to a better state. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The circumstances relating to the Commonwealth's responsibility in assisting in the management of Australia's fishing is of extreme importance. Australian fishing resources, considering the length of our coastline and the sea surrounding us, are not very great. They certainly do not compare with some of the Gulf Stream fisheries and areas like that which are, by comparison, huge. However, the north Atlantic is under great threat because of overfishing. Consequently, conservation of our fish stocks and careful management and sustainable management is of the greatest importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has responsibilities well outside those that once applied to state governments, particularly as the fishing effort goes further away from our shores. Also, the Commonwealth has responsibility particularly in the area off the Northern Territory, such as the Gulf of Carpentaria, and has had input there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian legislature has probably led Australia in fisheries management over the decades. There was a period, under the management of Mr Bernard Bowen&mdash;who now, amongst doing other things in his retirement, advises the Commonwealth in his role as a consultant&mdash;that probably was one of the most innovative periods. The concept of limited entry fishery goes back as far as I can remember&mdash;very early in the development of what we knew as the crayfish industry, which is now referred to as the rock lobster industry. It was recognised that this valuable resource&mdash;a very highly priced product&mdash;had to be managed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst originally that was resisted by free traders in the fishing industry, today it is clearly understood and has put a floor in the industry that has made its participants some of the most 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6499"> prosperous people in the country. The ownership of each individual lobster pot licence&mdash;the industry is controlled by the issuing of licences for a certain number of pots on each boat&mdash;which was once given out by the state, now trades at $30,000 each.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A typical cray fisherman in my electorate would probably have about 100. So he is a pretty wealthy fellow. He has a $3 million asset which he can trade in $30,000 units, which also makes it a very attractive means of asset building. Quite a lot of people today see them as an asset. I wish I had followed in some of my constituents' footsteps and bought pot licences when they were about $3,000 or $4,000&mdash;and I thought they were grossly overpriced then. However, it has built an asset into the industry whilst applying conservation measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A matter of considerable controversy and debate occurred in my electorate just a few years ago. In his closing statement, the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) referred to the substantial increase in technology that has been applied to the fishing industry. I wish to talk about that for a moment. Because of that, fishing effort increased dramatically. In fact, on the recommendation of the representative bodies of the industry itself, the government was asked to reduce the number of pots available to the fishing industry by 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This became a controversial issue, but the state government eventually had the courage to reduce the quantity by 18 per cent. Some people suggested that that would mean a massive loss to the industry, but there was none whatsoever. The fish catch continued at relatively the same level but, furthermore, the value of these pot licences that I have just referred to increased automatically, and the gross asset value of each fishing enterprise was unchanged. However, it has made a difference because it is creating the opportunity for sufficient of these animals to survive each year and go on with the breeding process which guarantees the longevity of this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry has also expanded in many ways. What was once a process of catching, cooking, freezing and selling to the United States is now an industry which is much more highly technological and which has processes to keep the animals alive. They have discovered that they can put them into suspended animation by chilling to a certain degree. They are shipped overseas live at great financial premiums into markets in Asia, in particular. This has added significantly to the revenues of the industry. With the sorts of procedures that are now being used, they can keep the animals alive onshore well past the fishing season, which is very important in evening out supply and, consequently, in maintaining price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did make a few points about modern technology. Within my term of office as a member of parliament, for the majority of the areas where rock lobster in particular are caught&mdash;and most of the fishing is done in Western Australia&mdash;the reality is that the process has changed dramatically in that time. A lot of the technology associated with fishing resided in the minds of the fishermen. They had to do the best they could to relocate the reliable spots. Over time, there was some depth&hyphen;sounding equipment available which allowed them to identify the particular depth and shape of the bottom which they were looking for in order to catch their fish. But, of course, that has progressed to a point where not only do they now know where the fish are, to within a matter of metres, through the GPS technology, but their ability to service that catch has speeded up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that not only do they know where they want to go to put out the pots and can get there within a metre or two, but, having dropped them there, the following morning they can put the boat on automatic pilot, dial up where the first pot is and go to sleep, if they choose to, and their boat will take them to within a couple of metres of that pot. They do not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6500"> have to spend considerable time searching for them, and they do not have to lay out five or six pots where one will do. They needed five or six pots in the past, simply to be somewhere near the target and, of course, to make them easier to find. Rolling around in a boat and looking for a float that in old&hyphen;fashioned terms is about eight inches in diameter was a very difficult task. The ability to catch fish improved with the quality of the boats, the speed of the boats and all the technology that is now available, and so that did require there to be a reduction in pot size.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, within the direct responsibility of AFMA was the Gulf of Carpentaria&mdash;where successive governments, believing in free enterprise and all those sorts of things, granted excessive licence entitlements to trawl for prawns, which appeared to be a limitless resource. In the early days, we even had the Russians coming down with very large deep&hyphen;sea trawlers and making huge catches, particularly of banana prawn, which is a schooling type of prawn. In the early days, there would have been enough of these animals in the net to stop a trawler. But that resource was very quickly used up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prawn resource is very much reactive to land weather conditions. In other words, the spawning occurs in creeks and, if you do not get the rainfall necessary to flush them out into the open sea, you get very limited catches. All this was very obvious, and AFMA and the other controlling federal bodies have had to go through a continuing process of buying back licence entitlements. The process they chose was not all that efficient, and it took a long time to get to a situation where we could see a reversal of the continuing decline of catches and the lack of economics in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite a number of the boats that operate in the Gulf of Carpentaria are actually based in my electorate, particularly out of Geraldton, and it is very interesting to talk to the fishermen, who are very conservation minded and do understand that their welfare resides in proper conservation measures but who frequently criticise the processes that are used. There were a thousand propositions put forward for conservation, from restricting the period of catch to putting quotas on individual fishermen, which is quite a silly proposition. All that does is maintain a situation where the bad fishermen get as much quota as the good fishermen, which does not encourage the sorts of efficiencies we need in the industry. There were many different propositions, but the authorities in Western Australia eventually said, `The thing that catches the crayfish is the pot; so, if we restrict the number of pots in the water, clearly we are reducing the fishing effort.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposition was not put in the Gulf of Carpentaria by the federal authorities, who wanted to issue licences based on the horsepower of the boat, the length of the boat and all sorts of peculiar things&mdash;when the fishing effort is, in fact, all in the trawl net. Constituents of mine have never been able to convince the authorities that the control ought to be purely on the net capacity of individual boats. They should be able to tow as much as their power and other things will allow; but, consequently, the restrictions should be on net capacity, because that is clearly what is catching the fish, and not necessarily the horsepower of the boat towing the net. Those are the matters that still need to be addressed, to my mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do welcome these measures, in particular, the increasing of fines, and particularly as they apply to the pirates of the sea&mdash;the people who come into our areas of fishing resource to catch fish. Of course, if you are there illegally in the first place, you are not going to pay much attention to the conservation measures that we apply to our licensed fishermen, and that is the greatest threat to the future of the industry. So it is incumbent upon Australia to make 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6501"> sure that we prevent people entering our fisheries who are not licensed, because they add to the fishing catch but they will just catch as much as they can before they escape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lyons mentioned our involvement, in the treaties committee, in looking at the southern bluefin tuna industry and the fact that that was brought almost to the brink of extinction by gross overfishing by foreign countries within what might be measured as Australia's nature resource. It is still a problem because tuna are such migratory species. They breed in northern waters, and at that stage are subject to control by the Indonesian authorities, then take themselves over nearly to South Africa and then back to Australia. At each stage, they are either within or out of the control of varying nations and are extremely vulnerable to overfishing, which is heartbreaking when one considers their value, particularly in the Japanese sashimi market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made very strong recommendations that Australia maintain a very tough line in negotiations with Japan on catching these fish in this area, simply because we would love to see the resource substantially increased. We now see the South Australians farming these fish&mdash;and there is a lot of sense in that. Nevertheless, the fishing technology that abounds on the high seas today is a major threat to the future of many fish stocks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have criticised purse seining in the case of tuna fishing. The old system of poling the fish, whilst highly inefficient, was a great contributor to conservation, because it guaranteed that some of the fish got away. That is pretty important&mdash;they have got to get away to breed. When you are able to identify a schooling variety of fish, such as tuna, by using an aeroplane and then sailing around it, putting a net around the entire school and zipping up the bottom to make sure none gets away, it is not very smart in terms of the longevity of the industry in which you are involved. But that is what purse seiners do, and that is to be condemned. We still have some in Australia, although they are primarily being used in fish farming, which is at least subject to catch limitations so that you just cannot keep going back to get the last school, but we have to be a bit sensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drift netting is another method of fish catching to be condemned. It is too indiscriminate and it takes a lot of animals that have no commercial value but are drowned or finished when the net is rolled in. Long&hyphen;lining, whilst a little more selective and seen as a fairly efficient method of catching tuna and those types of fish, is another method that can give too much capacity to the fishing fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not see here some of the North Sea issues, where ships that we would probably consider cruise liners have a continuous trawling and processing effort and literally suck the bottom dry. We saw the collapse of the cod industry in the north Atlantic, something which nobody ever dreamed would happen. The Canadians fight a continuing battle to protect their salmon stocks, which are fish that all of us have been raised to believe were there forever. They are not, if people are foolish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people are fishing, for instance, in Antarctic waters, and the mere cost of getting there would be in the tens of thousands of dollars, I am not sure that, if there is a very substantial reward in terms of fish catch available to them, a $50,000 fine is going to worry them very much. Furthermore, it is going to cost us hundreds of thousands to send a ship down there to catch them. I think anything less than the confiscation of all the fishing equipment, including the boat, is insufficient. They know they are not allowed there. They know that they are doing damage. They do not care, because they do not even know if they are coming back. It is not their resource. I think we have to be prepared to attack that very seriously.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6502">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research&mdash;and the member for Lyons mentioned some of that&mdash;is absolutely essential. We just simply do not know in many cases how long it takes certain fish varieties to achieve maturity and become breeding stock. That is of grave concern because you go on catching fish and you catch fewer every year but there seems to be plenty there. Then, as they found in the north Atlantic, you go back one year and there are none. In the north Atlantic, they had gone because, in the previous years, they had removed all the breeding stock and gone on catching the immature stock, leaving nothing to breed on. Fortunately, somewhere, there must have been a few of them because there is some recovery. Now they are fighting and scratching to get in there before there is substantial recovery. We have had the same problem with southern bluefin tuna. There has been some improvement in their numbers and immediately, in this case, the Japanese are demanding increased quotas when we are far from having anything like satisfactory recovery of fish stocks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is right to welcome this legislation which improves the ability of AFMA, the federal management authority, to do its job. It gives it a better opportunity to enter premises and other places to inspect what is going on and to catch people who are not dealing within the law. Anecdotally, it is very interesting. There is a limit on the size of a crayfish or rock lobster that can be caught in my electorate. As a hotel keeper many years ago, I had a visit from a fisheries inspector. He walked into my coolroom and started shaking the barrels of beer. I wondered what he was up to until he told me that the latest means of hiding them had been to screw the bung off the barrel of beer and pack it full of crayfish. The inspector came in and had a look around and could not see any shells around the place and thought it was right. But they eventually woke up. These are the dreadful things that people do to break the law.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not support this legislation. I am not going to vote against it because it would not serve much purpose. But I think the key was in the minister's second reading speech.

To this end, the primary function of the minister in relation to the Commonwealth fisheries is to accept plans of management determined by AFMA. This is not the case with joint authority fisheries.

A few years ago, the scallop fishery based in Shark Bay in Western Australia occasionally would suffer a catastrophic season and there would be great calls to stop the industry altogether. This went on for several years and the fishing effort was reduced but then they found that it depended entirely on the spat set. Because of the fecundity of the scallop, if you fished all but a handful of scallops, if the set was right you would get a very good season again next year. By going into water and taking tests, they could tell you well before the season opened what the scallop season was going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, we had an example of this in the Abrolhos area of the scallop fishery where they determined that, for some reason or other, spat had not set and there would be no scallops&mdash;and that proved to be the case. I tried to get the fisheries minister to immediately open the Shark Bay scallop fishery, where the season starts a few weeks later&mdash;the spat set there had indicated that it would be good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support limited entry fisheries. I think Western Australia has been the Australian leader in this sort of fishery management, but it is not the only strategy. For centuries, the Japanese have used the method of fishing to economic extermination. They then leave it, and 50 to 100 years later the industry comes back. One cannot but deny that it has worked in the past for the Japanese. It is not a method I advocate, but certainly, no&hyphen;one can deny that that is what has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about this legislation. Fishermen in New South Wales told me recently that the fisheries department there has said categorically that its idea is to make fishing so difficult that it will reduce the catch&mdash;in other words, it is looking to reduce the catch by simply impeding the fishermen. Where a fisherman has a multiple licence, he has to nominate on the day whether he is going out to trawl, and if he is, he must take all his line fishing equipment off his boat. If he is going out to trawl for deep&hyphen;sea fish, like ling, he cannot go for prawns or something else. If a fisherman gets out there and finds a southerly blowing so he cannot trawl, he has to steam all the way back to port, change his gear and go out again. That means, of course, that the day is wasted. That is a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has recently signed a treaty with Japan to allow the Japanese entry to the 200&hyphen;mile zone for $3.5 million annual payment&mdash;and the Commonwealth thinks it has done a good deal. Firstly, there is no real control of what the Japanese catch. While it is true that we put observers on some of the boats, the observers have said to me that they have been ordered below by the captain when the catch is coming up. On the occasion when we did apprehend some illegal trawlers, they had catches far greater than those registered by the legal trawlers. I suspect that we do not have any real grasp of the quantity of product that they are taking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is in contrast to the laws that apply in the south&hyphen;east trawl. Fishermen have told me that up to $20 million worth of overquota product is dumped back in the sea. This occurs because fisheries have said they have a quota of so much fish. When they are fishing for another species, quite often they catch the fish which they have already exceeded their quota on. They have no alternative but to dump it back in the sea, where 100 per cent of these fish die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the fishermen are caught with these fish on their boats, they are subject to heavy fines. This is an absolute nonsense. People involved in that industry have told me that they reckon the loss is about $20 million a year. Of course, there is no record of it, and it is simply a waste all around&mdash;a waste of fish, a waste of resources, a waste of time and a waste of money.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6504">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this act is the draconian nature of it. In this act we are increasing the power of fishery inspectors to inspect premises without warrant. This is a dangerous situation. The erosion of civil liberties is happening across the board. While it seems to be applauded by members of the government and the opposition, I believe it is a dangerous trend in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we ought to be doing is seeking the cooperation of the industry, and the bureaucrats and the scientists ought to be involved. They ought to be getting out there much more regularly with fishermen and seeing the real problems and understanding the difficulties that fishermen operate under. We also ought to be putting more effort into seeing how we can increase fish stocks. I have no doubt that we will seek to limit recreational fishermen. We will say, `You cannot fish with your rod and line or your small net.' In the land of the free, that is an outrageous situation, when we know that if we were to create artificial reefs or floating platforms in many of our areas that would clearly increase the proportion of pelagic fish available. That sort of thing should be the endeavour, rather than clamping down on the rights of individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many species of fish which can easily be bred in captivity and returned to the sea. With small fish you are going to get a much higher survival rate than you get in nature, where they are developed from eggs and go through various stages. That, too, could be looked at to increase our resources. I have had a case recently, again in Shark Bay, where the department arbitrarily banned the recreational fishermen from taking snapper from one side of the bay. That was done without any real scientific basis, and I am pleased to see that that total ban has now been relaxed. Here is a fish which we know we can breed in captivity and could be returned to the sea. I believe that if we used fish licence money, or even just government resources, to do that sort of thing, we would be serving a much better purpose than the draconian stance that we often adopt at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some expertise in marketing fish is another thing that is needed. There is a lot of by&hyphen;catch which does not have a lot of value. I believe everything caught should be landed on the shore and should be processed. Even if it is only processed for fish meal, it is better than throwing it back into the sea where it is invariably going to die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was recently in Batemans Bay and I got a box of ling fillet. A few years ago, the only purpose fishermen used ling for was as bait in craypots. It is an absolutely exquisite fish and a good eating fish, one that I think rivals the famous barramundi from my electorate. Now it is a very useful commercial fish. When I first started shark fishing&mdash;I was involved with Harvey Gurney in pioneering shark fishing at Eucla, which is quite difficult waters&mdash;we used to catch a lot of what we called dog sharks, which were discarded. They now find that there is a commercial application for them. I believe that sort of research is very useful. Most of this research is in fact done by fishermen, not by AFMA, not by the authorities, not by the bureaucrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently in Esperance, where there was pressure on the southern cray, as distinct from the western cray that occurs in Geraldton and on the western side of my electorate&mdash;the southern cray being the much bigger animal&mdash;local fishermen decided they would try the continental shelf. There they found very large stocks of cray and the giant crab which has also found a very good market in Asian countries. Here there is a type of giant crab with a horn which does not enjoy any market there, I guess because of its ugliness. It seems to me that we should be seeking ways to process that meat, because I am sure that once it was processed the buyer would not know from which particular crab it came.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6505">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is what one would call good socialist legislation. It seeks to impose controls from the top down. In my view it does not deal with the issue, because the nature of fishermen, and of their industry, is that they are going to seek to avoid where they can, and not work in conjunction with, the authorities. I believe the legislation clearly fails in that it does not seek to set up that cooperation between the fishermen and the management authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that if you were to seek cooperation you would get it because a lot of these fishermen are very conservation minded. I talk to them all the time in my own electorate and many of them are concerned. But they also know when they are being subjected to bureaucratic nonsense and they resent it very strongly. I believe that, as the demand for aquaculture grows and we see species farmed, we must look also to expanding the resources that are available to fishermen because there will always be a demand in some areas for that ocean&hyphen;caught fish. There is a view in some circles that it does deserve a premium. The job of the government and of the scientist should be looking to do whatever is possible to expand the numbers and not simply to curtail the effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, it is quite clear to me that limited entry is the way to go. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) was quite right when he said the controls, if any, should be on the fishing effort&mdash;in the case of crays on pots, in the case of prawns on net size. That is so logical one cannot see how anyone can really argue with it. Limited entry does give value to the industry. And while it flies right in the face of Hilmer&mdash;and this is going to be a dilemma for the government&mdash;it is quite clear that if you apply Hilmer to the fishing industry you cannot have limited entry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But limited entry does give an asset; it does ensure viability. It reduces the pressure that fishermen feel that they need to make a living and I urge the government, both at the state and federal level, to look at limited entry fisheries and control in that way. I also urge much more cooperation with the industry from the bureaucrats. As I said earlier, given unlimited power with no controls and no oversight by the minister, that power will be abused, just as it has been abused in the ATSIC Act where the minister has no real authority. In my view, if the government had the nerve to amend the ATSIC Act to give the minister the overriding authority, you would see a great improvement in that very inefficient and retrograde piece of legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. This is a bill which continues the government's strong commitment to the fishing industry and allows for further commitments to be brought into force. The government understands the importance of maintaining our very valuable fisheries resource, and our commercial harvest alone is valued at approximately $1.7 billion a year, which brings many social and economic benefits across the whole country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we manage our fisheries in an ecologically sustainable way and to ensure that future generations will be able to have the same access and enjoyment that we all have. It is without doubt that Queensland is renowned for some of the best seafood in Australia. The waters of Moreton Bay, which border the Petrie electorate which I am very pleased to represent, and particularly the Redcliffe Peninsula, have a most plentiful supply of fish, crabs and prawns. Some of the wonderful delicacies that come from those waters are Moreton Bay bugs, mud crabs of course, brown tiger and banana prawns and whiting. They are just a few to name the abundance of catch that is in Moreton Bay. The waters are very rich and they have been providing economic sustainability and livelihood for the trawling and associated 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6506"> processing and export industries. Fishing is a very large recreational activity in Petrie and it is also enjoyed by the many thousands of residents and visitors who visit there every year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, in the Moreton Bay area, a meeting was held by the Queensland Fish Management Authority. A number of issues were discussed at that meeting, including pollution and denigration of the bay habitat. We need to develop a really responsible attitude towards all of the issues needing to be addressed, particularly things like fish sizes, the need for bag limits, and the review of patrol enforcement and regulations regarding bait and cast nets. It is important that we keep looking at that. I know that the Queensland Fish Management Authority has played a very responsible role, particularly in managing activities in the bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amazing thing about my electorate is the number of people who participate in fishing as a recreational activity as well. A most pleasing thing for me is to drive over the Hornibrook Bridge&mdash;or as many call it, the Horton Highway: Hays Inlet, Redcliffe and the Woody Point jetties are a source of constant relaxation and joy to many people. Fishing is indeed a very valuable recreational activity in the community, and many of us will always remember with great delight the first fish that we caught.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The demand for seafood is ever increasing, and will continue to increase in years to come. Consumers rate quality as extremely important, and they will pay a premium price for a top quality product. I note from the Queensland Fish Management Authority that Moreton Bay represents some three per cent of Queensland's coastline but that it covers 13 per cent of the commercial catch and 30 per cent of Queensland's recreational anglers. As honourable members will know, I have had a close affiliation to the fishing industry throughout my life, and I acknowledge the needs in industries that have been involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My family has been involved in the industry for over 45 years, and there have been some great changes in the industry over that time. Consumer demands and changes have been worth noting, particularly in restaurants. I can remember days not so long ago when to eat Moreton Bay bugs was simply out of the question. Consumers are also developing a taste for such items as calamari, and the consumption of oysters and mussels has increased markedly in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As in any industry, the issues can be many and varied, and there needs to be great consultation between the government, processors and industry managers in the local community if we are to develop really good seafood policy. There have been a number of recent health scares in Victoria and New South Wales which have highlighted the great need for food quality and safety in this particular industry. Those experiences also outlined what can happen when consumer confidence is undermined: areas of New South Wales are certainly feeling that to this day, particularly in light of their recent scares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge, therefore, is to produce, export and market a product that not only reaches the high standards of industry regulations but also meets the high demands of consumers. There is much emphasis on safe quality products, and one only has to look at such incidents as those in New South Wales and Victoria that I have just mentioned to see the damaging side effects that they can have for the whole seafood industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that there is presently some debate about the shortening time line on our fisheries. How much more we can expand our seafood catch is arguable, but we can increase our return for underutilised species. We can develop adequate and expanding aquaculture industries and we can add value to current catches through quality assurance programs. The aquaculture industry, in particular, has much potential. I know that there is much money being 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6507"> spent on research and development in Queensland to ensure the success of this particular industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently had the opportunity to open the Seafood Quality Assurance Summit in Brisbane and to represent the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) there. The summit provided an excellent opportunity to assist progress in the development of best practice manuals for the catching, processing and marketing of products in the wild&hyphen;caught prawn, spanner crab, mullet and reef fish sectors. It identified the impediments to maintaining quality for these products and also how to remove those impediments: interface with industry, airlines, supermarket, food service and other sectors is to the betterment of all, and we must ensure that that continues. The summit also determined future research and development and training priorities for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Resources and Energy for his interest and work in his portfolio, which deals with this particular area. I also thank him for the concern that he has shown recently for the fishing industry in Petrie by his taking time to visit processors in an area of significant industry interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill that is being debated today relates to the Fisheries Administration Act 1991, the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1991. A development from the Fisheries Management Act was the establishment of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. This authority was designed to develop efficient management systems for fisheries which come under the Commonwealth's jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, there are four objectives in the authority's charter. The first is to manage Commonwealth fisheries at an ecologically sustainable fishing level and conserve stock levels, and to appreciate the marine biology and habitat in order to ensure future viability. Secondly, the authority must maximise economic returns to the industry and broaden the community needs while meeting sustainability objectives. The third objective is to communicate effectively and consult with government, the fishing industry and other marine resource users and the broader community. The fourth is to achieve efficient and cost&hyphen;effective fisheries management and administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation amends and attempts to further define the role and activities of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, which was established in 1992, and provide greater security of long&hyphen;term access to fisheries. Recently the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs brought down a report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managing Commonwealth fisheries: the last frontier</EMPHASIS>. There are some important aspects that need to be mentioned. One of them is the management of the particular authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the important things about the industry is that we need to have proper assessment and we have to have proper, ongoing logbooks. The report quotes Mr John Tanzer, of the Queensland Fish Management Authority, who stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ideal situation is where you have reliable logbook data coming in&mdash;in addition.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said that we need what is called fishery independent assessment, receipts from marketing and stock assessments on the ground, so to speak, and that AFMA is starting to lead the way in fisheries management. It has stock assessment subcommittees set up for most of its management advisory committees, and commissions those to do the on&hyphen;ground assessment. We need to continue this constant monitoring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AFMA is responsible also for vessel monitoring systems. A number of positive aspects of the use of these vessel monitoring systems include improved compliance with the quota  system, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6508"> the ability to confirm correct behaviour, the ability to identify suspicious behaviour and, when it occurs, greater efficiency in port inspections, the enabling of AFMA to communicate with vessels, the reliability and low&hyphen;cost nature of the system, its use as a preventative, and improved safety and communication for fishing vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments will allow those with fishing rights far more assurance in their planning if there are changes to the management plans of the fishery. Fishing operators and investors will now have far more security of their investment and will be provided with protection when changes to government industry policy occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An avenue is provided in this legislation to establish and abolish subcommittees under the management advisory committees. Amendments to the act, through section 95, go towards removing penalties. In some cases, the level of penalties are raised, and in others dollar amounts are converted to penalty units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian fisheries have for decades provided the country with a constant and consistent base for income dollars. The challenge now is to strive and to continue this strong focus, and to allow the industry to continue and develop in a way which will provide sustainable benefits to the economy. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the government being concerned and pushing this matter to the bottom of the business paper. They may well have expected members of the opposition to use this issue regarding the minister involved but, quite frankly, the report is too important for that. This report is much more important than the minister because it is a report of a committee which has bipartisan support. It goes to the key issues affecting small business in this country, and small business is watching all of us very closely to see how we deal with this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that there will be government speakers coming forward who are part of the committee. A number of people on that committee worked very hard to try to bring forward a report which we could all agree with. There was one minor variation, and I will go to that later on in my speech, but the important part was that it is a second report by this committee&mdash;the first one was in 1989 and was a landmark report. This one is equally important. It takes things a stage further. If I just start to work through the recommendations, it will give some indication how vital this inquiry is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first recommendation deals with the role of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. There was a genuine concern among committee members and witnesses during the inquiry that the ACCC was not playing the role it could be playing. Therefore, the first recommendation in the report is an attempt to guide the government in encouraging the ACCC to be more proactive, to take up cases, particularly under the new section of the act where it recommends getting case precedents, so that there are examples available to the business community showing how the act could be applied in terms of unfair trading. Our concern was that unless the ACCC set that standard, all else would be in vain.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6511">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are aware that the ACCC has taken large companies to court and that there have been court cases and settlements. But because those settlements have been by agreement and have been out of court settlements, they have never been made public. They are, therefore, not available as case law for other people with, perhaps, similar problems. So, the very first recommendation is a request to make the ACCC more proactive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report deals in a very major way with retail tenancy, and, again, as in 1989, that  was a major part of the submissions. We had submissions from all over the country, in the main from small business people, and we are still getting submissions. In fact, one arrived this last week. The people involved had not realised that the inquiry had concluded, and their submission was heartrending. A young couple have lost a business and an awful lot of money because of the way they were treated. If this report had been adopted and in place, then their circumstances would have been different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was talking to a person in North Queensland this week who told me how at the end of his lease in a previous shopping centre he was told to go: end of story. The tenant had offered to pay more rent. He had built up a good business there, had paid his way and contributed to the set&hyphen;up in terms of contributions. At the end of the lease he was told to go. No ifs and buts: make way for somebody else. That kind of treatment is not conducive to confidence or to investment. Most of all, it affects people who are very powerless. When we were putting together the report there was very good cooperation&mdash;and I certainly offer my support to the Chairman, Mr Bruce Reid, and to Mr Richard Evans, who chaired it while Mr Reid was away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many cases we do not agree on these issues. In politics we have our divisions and our arguments but within that committee there was a very genuine attempt made to try to find forms of words that we could agree on because we all understood that behind it all we agreed with the general thrust. That was an important part of the process. I know people in the community imagine that we, as parliamentarians, spend all our lives fighting each other and arguing on often minor issues, but the fact is that much of our work goes into trying to find constructive and positive answers to the problems of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recommended a uniform retail tenancy code while at the same time recognising that tenancy is actually a state matter. All states have particular laws regarding tenancies, leases and so on, and those laws vary greatly from state to state. The machinery available to tenants and to landlords varies from state to state. It is those variations which often cause problems because you will find that a particular franchisor, for example, will often negotiate leases in shopping centres in different states with different instruments and with different laws in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have argued for is a uniform national tenancy code but, more importantly, that it be underpinned by the Trade Practices Act and by the ACCC so that it has some&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have found this recent experience quite without precedent and very disappointing. This inquiry has been a bipartisan inquiry which has been running for a year, and across politics we have worked very hard to get agreement on the recommendations. I know that members of the government wanted to speak on this and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6512"> there are certainly members of the opposition&mdash;myself, the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and others&mdash;who wanted to make a contribution. When the report was tabled, we had only a quarter of an hour for 14 committee members to speak. We were promised then that it would come to the Main Committee and that we would have adequate time to make our comment on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an obligation to our constituencies but, more importantly, to the committee and to the report, to ensure that understanding of the report is widespread and as comprehensive as possible because, quite frankly, we found during the hearings&mdash;as in so many of the other committees&mdash;that most people we spoke to had no idea about processes and how effective these processes could be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that my comments will now have to do not just for myself but for many others who cannot speak. It is disappointing that the government has chosen not to allow us to talk on what is one of the seminal issues facing small business and the best chance small business and the government have in this current parliament to actually change things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was talking before the interruption and the loss of a quorum forced by the government about the fact that the uniform tenancy code that we proposed&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="McLEAY" NAMEID="4I4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FI4">Mr ALLAN MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before they closed it down, which was unprecedented&mdash;I have not heard of such a circumstance before. What I was talking about was the need for the tenancy code to be underpinned by the Trade Practices Act and the ACCC. We have had the best tenancy codes in the world but most tenants are not big enough to take on the landlord. If the landlord wants to ignore the rules and ignore the codes, it is very difficult for tenants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the inquiry we have heard evidence in Victoria about mediation, and we heard from the tribunal in New South Wales about some of the other processes. When we talked to people who had been engaged in those processes, we found the stories were not as good as had been reported. In many cases, the cost of mediation was as great, if not greater, than going to court. So the concept of mediation, whilst fine in theory, in actual practice may not be as effective or within the reach of a small business person. In many cases, the small business person gets to that process only when he or she has lost a lot of money. We are talking about people whose bank accounts may be frozen and who may be under enormous economic duress. The idea that somehow they can then access these processes is, in many cases, not viable. It is important that the ACCC be in there with them, taking on unscrupulous landlords and people who are not obeying the code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within that tenancy code, we had a number of key ingredients and one of the prime ones concerned the rights of sitting tenants. We have been told by commercial interests that when a lease finishes that is the end of the story. Yet we discovered that in England sitting tenants have rights, in other words, they have something to sell. So the question of goodwill is pretty fundamental to the whole issue of small business. People invest their lives, their money and their labour on the basis that at the end of all they will be able to sell what they have built up. But what has happened with shopping centres is that they have not been able to, and the landlords have been saying, `At the end of the lease, you can say goodbye.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier a case in north Queensland. We are suggesting in the report that sitting tenants should have a right of renewal so they have some confidence that if they build the business they will in fact be able to capitalise on that investment of effort and, in many cases, of money. On the other hand, if they cannot capitalise on their investment and effort there is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6513"> a real danger that in the last few years of the lease they will let the business run down physically, so that the centre runs down and they hurt their neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During its discussions the committee spoke with the Property Council of Australia, with various landlords and, at a personal level, most of the members&mdash;and I am sure that I speak for the member for Scullin and others&mdash;spoke to organisations privately. Let me assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is recognition amongst the property owners that things are not good, that the growth in rents is not being matched by an adequate growth in turnover, and there is no doubt that margins are being squeezed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The property owners have a responsibility to their investors to make sure that they do not lose all of their investments. It would appear they have a difficulty in assessing the mixed responsibility between their investors and their tenants, but if they do not look after their tenants, eventually they hurt their investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are looking for from the government is some leadership on trying to find ways to encourage property owners to negotiate a consolidation, for want of a better word, of property values and rental values. We cannot have these seven, eight and 10 per cent increases per year that we have had for the last seven, eight or 10 years. The economy is flat, small business is suffering, and retail space is now greater than we can carry. We are seeing more and more centres, and not just where I come from, but virtually everywhere in the country. We are seeing centres either expanding or new centres going in. Even in Bunbury, I gather, there looks like some expansions or new centres going in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All over Australia we are seeing new centres and the expansion of centres, but the economy is not growing at the same pace as the floor space is growing. We are getting more space, more people going into these businesses and no more turnover, so the same money is being shared amongst more and more people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got to find a way to negotiate so that the investor and the tenant share some of the responsibility equally or mutually through some understanding. What has been happening to date has been that it has all been carried by the tenant. There is not a parliamentarian in this building, in either House, that does not have a case of someone losing their house or more and still owing. I have got cases right now and I am sure we all have. Almost on a weekly or monthly basis, people come to us looking to us as a person of last resort as to what they can do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not time for me to go through all the matters of the report, but the report touches on tenancy codes and it touches on franchisors, which is an enormous growth area but an area of danger. We have tried a voluntary code in this country and it has collapsed. It does not work. The good franchisors do not need it; the bad franchisors will not join it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying in the report, and we are saying very strongly, is that without legislation, franchising in this country is a great risk and it will not be viable. What we would be saying is to the bad franchisors, `You go for it', and to the good ones, `Do not bother'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is, unless we put weight behind the franchising code, the franchising code will be of no value and is of no value right now. The message to franchisees and the community, if the government does not adopt that particular recommendation, is, `It is open slather'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report was unanimous. The government has three months to respond. There is two months to go. I encourage small business across the country to do what we cannot do: talk about it&mdash;amongst themselves, with their landlords, with their friends, and particularly with their parliamentarians.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6514">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is a good report. I do not agree with all of it. In fact, none of the committee does, but we have worked our way through its recommendations to try and get agreement that we thought both sides of politics could live with. The opposition has announced its support for it. The Democrats have announced their support for it. We wait very much with bated breath for the government to come up strongly and say they endorse it all. We do not want some weasel words about bits and pieces here and there or about the thrust of it, we want the report adopted in its totality. Unless you adopt all of it, it all falls apart. It holds together very tightly.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) very clearly was seeking the call&mdash;he stood and said, `Mr Speaker.' It may be that you did not hear him and that the member for Scullin was in your line of view.

The person who had originally been given the call&mdash;in this case, it would have been the member for Scullin&mdash;has deferred and never raised any objection to that procedure being followed by the Speaker.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The agreement with the government was it would come here in the week we tabled&mdash;the week of the twenty&hyphen;sixth. People like Mr Jenkins declined to speak in that 15 minutes in the chamber because we had been speaking up in the Main Committee in the week of 26 May&mdash;a month ago. We have been promised for a month we could debate it and now we cannot.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is out of order to debate the issue and there is no point of order. I will call on the member for Moncrieff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Mrs SULLIVAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. On that occasion, I was diverted by the deputy clerk who, as always, was trying to be very helpful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I was saying before even more of my time was used up by an opposition member, there has to be an order about these things. There was an order of business set down. There were people here ready to speak. The member for Bowman (Mrs West) had been here ready to speak after the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro). The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) and the member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn) are here now as people listed to speak on that bill. We simply cannot run this chamber in any other way. To come in and ambush the government&mdash;and it was an ambush&mdash;and also ambush the then occupant of the chair, who was me, brings the entire operation of this committee into disrepute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I moved this motion of dissent, somebody raised a question about whether those standing orders applied in this committee. The simple answer is that except where there are particular points of order specific to this chamber then the standing orders and the procedures of the House of Representatives apply in this chamber. The standing orders have lots and lots of gaps in them. They do not cover every little eventuality that can arise, but over time the collective wisdom of a variety of speakers has set down a procedure. That procedure is as I outlined it at the beginning and is the reason why I moved this motion of dissent from your ruling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The procedure is that if the person in the chair makes an error, they can choose to change the call. They can also choose to not change the call, and I have seen that happen too. You made a deliberate decision not to change the call and call the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). I had been in a not dissimilar situation in the chair some time earlier. You would not have seen it but the effect of the situation was that I could have decided to ignore to call 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6518"> the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and I could have called the member for Bowman who was then in here. But the procedure of the House and the procedure of this chamber is an alternating call from side to side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just a matter of courtesy and civilised behaviour. If the House of Representatives, and this Main Committee of the House of Representatives, cannot proceed with civilised, courteous behaviour, then sure, government or opposition can make it uncivilised and discourteous. They can stop it from operating effectively and they can frustrate all sorts of people. However, I really do urge you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to consider that what you did was not wise. You did have an alternative, but you chose not to take that alternative and so, in line with that, I am right to be moving this motion of dissent&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! I would ask those people who are not taking part in the debate to leave the chamber so that they are not interrupting the speakers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I actually do not mind being interrupted, Mr Deputy Speaker, but those making the noise might be those who need to hear what I am saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, as I said at the beginning, I do this with a great deal of regret because I think you have tried to be very fair and even&hyphen;handed in the chamber and it is a pity you have been put in the position you are in. I understand that the member for Wakefield is seconding my motion.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I call on the motion to be seconded, can I make the point that I have the speakers list in front of me and the only two speakers who had not spoken were the member for Scullin and the member for Moore. The member for Moore was not in the chamber so I called the member for Scullin. There were no other speakers on the list that I have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that I will make is that my decision made was under standing order 61 which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When two or more Members rise together to speak the Speaker shall call upon the Member who, in the Speaker's opinion, first rose in his or her place;</PARA>
