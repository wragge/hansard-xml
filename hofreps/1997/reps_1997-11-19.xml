<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was speaking last night on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R365">Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1997</XREF>  and the debate was interrupted, I was making a number of simple points on the amendments which we are debating together. I would like to recapitulate because I think the opposition are under a number of misapprehensions about the measures, particularly the amendments they are proposing and the purpose they will serve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will deal, firstly, with the matter of setting a time limit on the AAT reaching a decision. I did not mention this yesterday, but it is not unusual for time limits to be set in dealing with matters where, particularly, people might be held in detention&mdash;as they are in these character matters in many cases. In section 367 of the Migration Act there is provision that the Immigration Review Tribunal must make a decision and must notify the applicant within a prescribed period. Regulation 426 prescribes a period not of 42 days but of seven days. The reason for this is quite clear: when you are dealing with matters where there is some urgency&mdash;where people are detained&mdash;the 90&hyphen;day period that the opposition is suggesting obviously becomes totally unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter we are dealing with, which I would like to recapitulate, is the AAT itself and the way in which these particular 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matters operate. The procedures which the opposition is seeking to have remain in place are outlined in the AAT legislation. We are seeking in separate provisions&mdash;I think it is in 501G&mdash;to put in place the same types of procedures dealing with notice. Obviously it is going to be quite difficult in management terms to have two sets of procedures&mdash;those that are contained in the Migration Act and those that are in the AAT Act. The opposition are seeking to have those two sets of procedures operating together. Obviously they have not read the bill and do not understand the nature of the procedures and the duplication that they are putting in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to finally deal with the matter which is of far greater moment in this legislation so honourable members will be aware of it. Over a long period, matters relating to migration and particularly character issues have been determined by the minister representing the government of the day. It is not a matter in which the parliament should abdicate responsibility from the government to unelected tribunals to develop the framework of law and community standards that ought to apply. In the very rare cases that arise&mdash;and I indicated that I have only made decisions involving important character issues as minister in something like four or five cases in the time that I have been here&mdash;where the minister gets intelligence advice from international agencies about people who are of concern it is not appropriate that the applicant be informed of the nature of the intelligence. It might put people at risk. We are talking about very serious matters involving potential terrorists. We do not think it is appropriate that these matters ought to be dealt with in a way that leaves such people, who pose a risk to the community, at large. In this situation a minister should be given the opportunity with all of the political consequences of that to be able to cancel a visa. The natural justice loop is to be available, but after the visa has been cancelled and the opportunity for a person to be detained has been availed of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This provision, for which there is a like precedent in section 128, which relates to offshore cancellations, is what we are seeking here. It was a provision that the former 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10712"> government thought was necessary when they were in government to deal with matters of this sort and it is the sort of provision that ought to be available to people who have entered Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have been discussing in consideration in detail the issue of natural justice and the opposition's proposed amendments to ensure that the natural justice requirement does not disappear from the minister's responsibilities. There are a number of precedents and I would like to draw to the attention of the House the observations made by the now Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) himself back in August 1995. Speaking on telecommunications interception laws, he pointed out:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition, on the basis of natural justice, does have a general reluctance to support retrospective legislation . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is something that this legislation does provide for in part. He quoted one of his colleagues, who is now the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams), as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a fundamental principle of our legal system that laws are made to have prospective operation and not retrospective operation. It is simply unjust and oppressive to subject citizens to a law they have no means of ascertaining simply because the law has not been conceived, drafted, debated or enacted.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Furthermore, in that same debate he went on to talk about the need for balancing the competing interests of privacy, freedom of speech and law enforcement requirements and expressed great concern that in his view there was in that particular legislation a circumstance where the courts were not going to be able to supervise the activities of those who were being authorised in relation to telecommunications interception. He also talked about the need for the safeguard of judicial oversight, the need for an independent mechanism by which these decisions would be oversighted under the legislation being proposed by the government. So I note that the minister has in the past had regard for natural justice issues, the need for a proper balance in the powers of those who are making decisions and the need to ensure that those decisions are made on a proper basis and that there are proper 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accountability and proper safeguards against abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that on that particular bill the minister urged the government to accept his amendments and pointed out that the issue would be the subject of further discussion in the Senate. I would encourage the minister on this occasion also, if he is keen to get the legislation through&mdash;and I think the legislation, by any yardstick, enhances the minister's powers dramatically and represents a significant change in this area of ministerial powers in terms of character and conduct&mdash;to reflect seriously on the opposition's amendments with a view to getting the legislation through. It was noteworthy that this morning one of the Queensland government members had expressed, in the context of the Wik debate, public concern about the government's hard line against amendments, saying that the Senate should not be disregarded in a democratic system. The member said that he was concerned about public perception that the Wik legislation was damaging the reconciliation process and that the prospect of a double dissolution was horrendous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as with the Wik legislation, if the government is concerned about getting a bill through the parliament rather than the politicking of the issue and the political point scoring of the issue, I would urge the government to seriously consider the amendments. I understand that that would not happen now, but I urge it to seriously consider between here and the Senate the prospect of agreeing to the opposition's amendments with a view to getting a piece of legislation which certainly does provide the minister with enhanced powers but also maintains appropriate safeguards in relation to the issue  of natural justice, in relation to the right to reasons and also in terms of making the function of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal workable when it is confronted with cases of that kind. Accordingly, the opposition will be dividing once on these amendments, and urges the minister to consider them seriously between here and the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have always been prepared to con 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10713"> sider matters, and the shadow minister, the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), knows that with his predecessor and him I have been and will be quite prepared to talk these matters through. I do not disagree with what the honourable member has said. He has obviously been working overtime overnight looking for quotes from me in relation to obtaining a proper balance. I think this is a proper balance. I would have been grateful if the member who seems to have the carriage of this had been listening to what I had to say and had taken up some of the points I had made, particularly in relation to the precedents that have been established when you were in office to deal with situations which are unusual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not trying to deal with all the cases of character concern. I have indicated that the numbers of cases where I envisage such a circumstance will arise will be very rare indeed. I would hope that it would never arise. But I think a minister needs to be in a position where you receive credible information from intelligence sources about people who pose a risk to the Australian community where the disclosure of that information might well pose a risk for informants&mdash;and if you are dealing with terrorists that might very well be the case&mdash;and we have a system of law in relation to somebody of that character who gets into Australia, who actually arrives here, and you cannot cancel the visa and take that person into detention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me stress that I think the balance is being achieved by giving the person the opportunity afterwards to put matters before the minister to enable a reconsideration. But, in the unusual circumstances about which I am speaking, it seems to me that it is a major risk to the Australian community to leave at large a person who we believe poses such a risk to the community, simply because there is a natural justice loop that can be exploited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am saying that there ought to be a proper balance. I am not running away from those sorts of comments that I have made in the past or my own record in relation to those matters. A proper balance is posed by allowing for reconsideration by the minister afterwards, when the matter can still be addressed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> if there is reasonable information that can be put that would satisfy the minister that this person is not the person that our intelligence information suggests he or she is. That is the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that, if you go back to the provisions in section 128, those were exactly the arrangements that you put in place several years ago, in 1992, in legislation for offshore situations. What we are seeking to deal with here is an onshore situation. Let us understand it. Offshore, the person is not here to pose the risk to the community. Onshore, the same person and the same circumstances can pose a risk, and we have to leave them at large. That is what we want to address. We can come back and look at the matter afterwards, and that is proposed in the legislation. That is the balance, and I think it is the balance that you ought to assume. I am quite happy to talk about it, but I would hope that on these matters you might be persuaded that provisions of this sort are not unreasonable in all the circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was interrupted I was talking about the need for schools to be attractive to students and parents. I had mentioned some retention figures for years 10 to 12 in the five high schools in Mount Druitt, in my electorate. I thought I would read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  some more retention rates, bearing in mind that the New South Wales state average is 66 per cent. Bidwill is the best, with 50.4 per cent; Dunheved 30.3 per cent; Mount Druitt 37.6 per cent; Shalvey 38.9 per cent; and Whalan 45.3 per cent. If there is a difference between the government and the opposition on this issue of youth allowance, it is from our perspective that the Labor Party is always prepared to recognise the human dimension and sees investing in education, training and job readiness as being in the national interest, not only best for the individual person but best for the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10715">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my part of the world in particular, and I suspect in others, we have a problem with young males who do not see schooling as being relevant to their needs. That is why we urgently need to change and why I am advocating a vocational component, TAFE courses, in the proposed new senior high school for Mount Druitt. In passing I should mention a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> article by the New South Wales Teachers Federation, who say that they believe that the states should do away with the specialist high schools, that is, the elite high schools, the technology high schools and the senior high schools. I disagree with their position. At the end of the day we want to do two things: firstly, provide choice for students and their parents&mdash;and, once having tasted choice, I do not think you can go back&mdash;and, secondly, make the public sector attractive and competitive. St Mary's Senior High School is reversing the drift from public to private education. I believe that the new senior high school at the Nirimba educational precinct, to be opened in 1999, and the senior high school for Mount Druitt with feeder junior schools will do the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not spoken about the unemployed 18- to 20-year-olds who will now be subjected to a parental means test. Government members have no consideration, when they run around proudly touting how supportive of families they are, of the impact this measure will have on families. The illustration I like to give, which is applicable in my own electorate and in others, is what the Department of Housing does when a family has a son or a daughter in the workplace. As soon as that happens, the rent they pay is increased to take into account the earnings of the children. The economic rationalists&mdash;although this was a measure introduced into my own state by a Labor minister, Frank Walker&mdash;would say: `That is fair enough. Why shouldn't that be the case? This reflects a capacity to pay.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this measure presents a lot of problems for families. The parents become responsible for the payment of the rent. The children&mdash;or, I should say, young adults&mdash;incur the liability but do not necessarily pass the money on to their parents. One of the net effects of this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> brilliant measure is to see people being forced out of home. It leads directly to an early, if you like, not so much breakdown of the family but a shifting out of the siblings. Much as I recognise that economic rationalists will feel particularly keen about that measure, I particularly object to it because of its implications for families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have talked about a situation where 18- to 20-year-olds are earning money, but what happens when they are unemployed and, because of a parental means test, are in receipt of no money at all? A lot has been said on our side of the House about these people being the same people who have a right to vote&mdash;as they should&mdash;to decide who should govern the country, and the same people who can be conscripted in case of a national emergency. But we are saying that, notwithstanding the fact that they get all these rights of citizenship, they should not get unemployment benefits and they are insufficiently mature to be anything other than dependent on their parents. What is that going to be like for family lives?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I know that this will have absolutely minimal impact in the leafy suburbs of the North Shore or, indeed, the eastern suburbs, but in western Sydney it is going to provide additional hardships. It is going to mean that young people are going to be more dependent on their parents than they may already have been at a time when their peer group is out there earning and spending money, as is the wont of young people. These will in fact be second&hyphen;class Australians. The difference, again, between the government and the Labor Party comes with compulsion. The conservatives say, `We champion individual freedom; we champion the rights of the individual.'</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FILING" NAMEID="QT4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And you do too. When it comes to the youth allowance, we are into compulsion. We force young people&mdash;16&hyphen; to 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds&mdash;who may not necessarily see any relevance in schooling, to go back to school. We give them no choice, as otherwise we take their youth allowance away from them. If they happen to be 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and unemployed, we say, `You're going to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10716"> have to go through a parental means test and, if you don't survive that, you get nothing.' We say that skilling people, getting people on the education escalator, is a marvellous thing; we're all for it. But we do not believe in compulsion. We believe in encouraging people via reciprocal obligations. I think that is the starkest contrast between the government members and the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sincerely hope that all the 16&hyphen; to 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in my electorate and in other electorates in the western suburbs of Sydney understand only too well what is being done to them by this government. I hope those 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who are unemployed&mdash;the group of people with the highest unemployment in Australia: Australia's youth&mdash;understand what the government is trying to do to them. The government is not increasing the opportunities for more skills; it is actually cutting back on significant programs, whether they are labour market programs or whether they are student at risk programs. Above all else, we on this side of the House believe that it is entirely appropriate to have public investment; that is, governments recognising the worth of individuals and being prepared to invest in their future and thus guaranteeing Australia's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly do not believe that the answer to our economic problems is this compulsion that the government is into or cutting back investment the way the government has in the youth of Australia. We want to see more of it. We do not believe that cutting wages&mdash;an across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board 10 per cent or 15 per cent cut in wages&mdash;is somehow marvellous public policy. We believe the future of our nation is in having an even more highly skilled work force, a more highly involved work force and, indeed, having an export culture in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt this bill, although we will divide on it, will get carried. I think it is a tragedy for young people; I think it is rendering young people as second&hyphen;class citizens in their own country. It is relying on brute force of government rather than attracting young people into further education or into further training&mdash;whether that is with the encouragement of mutual obligations that were a feature 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the One Nation policy. The Labor Party stands for reducing unemployment to five per cent. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Chifley. I know that his comment was meant in the spirit of the debate, but I do, unfortunately, find some disagreement with the member for Chifley in relation to what he identifies as a problem which he does not wish to address in reality. He is saying that the Labor Party stands for a target of five per cent unemployment. At the same time, to achieve that target, one needs to redirect attention to the private sector and, to do that, one needs to demand a whole of government attitude to it and not focus on one side of the line&mdash;that is, the public expenditure side&mdash;without looking at the fact  that that money has got to come from somewhere. It will come only from a vibrant economy that permits the distribution of those funds to those in need, and those in need are a key and crucial element of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance is an income support payment to around 560,000 people, including students and those looking for work. It replaces five existing payments, including Austudy, the youth training allowance, the newstart allowance and the sickness allowance for under&hyphen;21-year-olds. The Austudy allowance is for under&hyphen;25-year-olds. The youth allowance will be introduced on 1 July 1998. The reason for it is that the government is proposing to help young people make key decisions about education, training and employment and make income support arrangements simpler and more flexible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance is also designed to change the culture&mdash;this is what I was going to focus on in my few remarks&mdash;of handout. I am referring to the culture that at 15 years of age you can walk down to the CES and expect a handout from there on, never mind the necessity to engage in training, never mind the necessity to look to a greater educa 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10717"> tional perspective, but rather a culture that there is something there from age 15.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To change that culture, I think we also need to set examples at higher levels. It is no good just saying that this is a situation that does need changing. At the same time we have the youth of Australia saying, `Politicians, judges and what have you are also getting a slice of the cake and that is not fair.' I refer, for example, to double dipping. I think it is reprehensible that anyone in public life can receive a pension from the Crown and yet be quite able bodied and go out and work in a full-time job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people are being asked to make sacrifices and to get out there and look for work. Yet they come back to us and say, `Just a minute, you're getting a pension or retired judges are getting pensions and then going out and doing royal commissions and inquiries.' We have seen a plethora of those in Queensland with the CJC. It really does strike a chord in the community. It is unacceptable and it is time that we, as people who should be setting an example, looked at these areas. When you leave public life, if you are an ex&hyphen;judge, ex-public servant or what have you, you should not be allowed to double dip. Once you start working again, you should not be allowed to get that pension. I think that is something that we really have to look at very seriously if we are to set an example of expenditure restraint in these other areas. That is part of the total culture and total flavour of the thing. That goes to a lot of areas, as I have mentioned before. It is something that we have to look at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also as part of the culture we have to change&mdash;I think this bill does go part of the way but we have a lot further to go&mdash;we have to change the disturbing paradox we have, which is that if you are hardworking and looking for work, you are going to be hit hard because you are doing well, but if you decide to slip around the edges and be indolent, less than thrifty, avoid responsibilities and so forth, you are going to be rewarded. That is one of the problems that we have in society. More and more, the complaints that come through to my office are from people who are working very hard and who have, for exam 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ple, just gone over that little threshold level for any particular situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, for example, a constituent rang up in relation to the so-called baby bonus. I thought that people collected that bonus irrespective of means. This particular couple were both working. They were not drawing a huge income jointly but it was over the amount to qualify for the so&hyphen;called baby bonus. The constituent pointed out to my office that there was never any statement to the effect that they would not be eligible for it. They were not complaining about the fact of non-eligibility but they were generally raising something that is commonly raised&mdash;that is, hard workers are the ones who are more likely to pay for indolence. It is that conundrum that we really have to deal with in the culture in this country. It is something that is extremely difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently I received a letter from a constituent from Ferny Hills. It was not a particularly favourable pro&hyphen;government letter by any means. I will refer to it because it does touch on some of these matters which I think are necessary to touch on. The constituent wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition's supposed non-interventionist stance is both selectively applied and poorly conceived. The fact is that levels of social, business, industry and rural welfare are higher than ever and exist in direct opposition to this Government's ideology. Personally I am not in favour of any form of welfare whatsoever as it gives rise to a false economy with no real foundation, neither am I in favour of tax avoidance whether by individuals or by multi&hyphen;nationals. Welfare recipients should be required to either work for benefits or repay them when work is obtained and scrap the rest. Women should be paid to rear children in a family context only. Not new or terribly popular ideas I'm sure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Some of those remarks struck a chord with me. I think we all have to realise in this place that there is a limit to the welfare dollar and there is a limit to squeezing those people who are working hard, yet again for them to be told, `Well, you're going to miss out.' We do do this. Unfortunately, we do this across a range of areas. In this particular area we are doing it to a group of people with parental incomes over $41,000 who have children at home aged between 18 and 20. This is a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10718"> group that we will be targeting with this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that these measures are necessary but, by the same token, it is important to look at that culture and how those people see themselves as being targeted. I am not saying that it is the correct way to look at it, but that is the way they see it&mdash;for their thrift, energy and hard work, they are being targeted and kicked yet again. That is what they are saying to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a message we must heed. We cannot ignore the number of people out there who have worked hard all their lives. A gentleman recently wrote to me and said that he had worked with the PMG for 46 years. In that time, he achieved for himself a self&hyphen;funded situation. He had just been a worker in the PMG; he did not have a high flying job, as I understand it. At the end of his 46 years he received his full superannuation pension which he banked every fortnight into a joint account. But he said that this financial year he  is going to have to pay tax because the very fact that he put that into a joint account, earning interest of $5.97&mdash;divided by two, because it was put into a joint account&mdash;meant that he would have to pay tax on that. That is bureaucratic stupidity, in my view. It is again an example of that group of people who have done the right thing being picked at in this way. We have to bear those things in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had a youth meeting in my electorate office recently, which was very interesting because of the range of views that came across. Many people who were there discussed the proposed youth allowance, and many of them discussed the difficulties they had obtaining part&hyphen;time work. There was a range of views. One contributor to the discussion said that she can point to two or three jobs `just like that' when told by others in the group that there was no work for students. Obviously there are a range of views out there, including that work can be found if you look for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is right for the government to encourage people to look for part&hyphen;time work when they are studying. There are no free lunches any more. It is important to impart that to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community: the free lunch regime is finished. We have to impart that work ethic to the community. That does not mean by the same token that we can be heartless about it, but I believe that it is necessary to have the sorts of discussions I have had in the electorate to illustrate the range of views one way and the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of that discussion was that in a networking sense a number of young people were able to identify areas where perhaps there were jobs that they had not accessed before. That was a very useful aspect of it. But, as a part of all this, it is true that the previous government cultivated this culture to a degree for self&hyphen;interest reasons. There were substantial votes from a section of the community which became welfare dependent. Welfare was never intended to be a dependency thing; it was always intended to be a short&hyphen;term situation. Unfortunately, over time many people have become dependent on it, and that is not a good thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This can flow through into other areas. I refer to the homeless youth allowance. Recently a youth worker said on a Brisbane radio station that more than half of those that he encountered on the streets preferred to be there. When asked why, he said it was because there was no discipline; they do not have the discipline of home. I say this about this sort of thing, the homeless youth allowance in particular: we have heard the reason being given for this allowance is abuse, but that is a ubiquitous word and I have a lot of trouble with the allowance. It should be available only in the most extreme circumstances and then on proof that the abuse is real and continuing, not imagined&mdash;we have heard about the tragedy of the Skye Walton case in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also put this to the House: why is the responsibility for this allowance shifted to the taxpayer? If parents really abuse their children, they ought to be the ones who are responsible. By behaving in that anti&hyphen;social, wrong way, they ought not be able to abuse the system and have their responsibilities shifted to the Australian taxpayer. The responsibility should stay with the abusers, if the abusers are real and if there has been proof.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10719">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had many examples of this in my own electorate. I do have concern that there are young people who have been abused but, by the same token, there are people who are working the system. One tragic example of that came to my attention late last year when I attended a meeting in my electorate of a group called Tuff Love. In this particular group a lady told me a horrendous story. Her daughter basically would not conform to the rules of home. She left home, went to the Department of Social Security and made allegations of serious sexual interference by her mother.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Twelve months later, the girl returned home after living on the streets and in various other places, and living with her boyfriend somewhere&mdash;and getting this allowance. She came back and apologised to her mother for all the hurt that she had caused but, at the same time, the taxpayers of Australia picked up the tab for that sort of behaviour. That is unacceptable; the person concerned should have a responsibility. As my constituent said in that letter to me earlier, there should be a requirement to pay back in those circumstances and in other circumstances where the system is being rorted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to change that culture. Efforts have been made in the United States to change welfare. Changes have been directed at ensuring that welfare is limited to relief&mdash;welfare for a term, not dependency. Very significantly, there was an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> some months ago about the successes and the great strides that have been made in some states in America by having caps on welfare. There is a limited time that you can be on supporting parent pension, for example. It is two years in one particular state, but I cannot recall which one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These systems are working. They send messages out that there is not a free and open slather to live the way you want and the taxpayer picks up the tab, that responsibility needs to be put into this equation. The message coming through in America was that the programs that had been started, which had been going for about 18 months, have done tremendous things. In fact, there was a drop in welfare of something like 24 per cent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> across the board in the states of the US that had adopted these measures. It is important to look ahead. I do not at all subscribe to following everything that the United States does. But I do believe that it is necessary to look ahead with these things and to take a realistic view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, this problem of punishing those who are thrifty and rewarding those who are indolent is a culture that has to change. It flows through into so many areas. It flows into the child support area. Abuses of that system are coming to the fore constantly. Yet again, people who have been the innocent party are finding themselves being punished by the state organised system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the measure is brought in, and I urge the House to pass it. I ask all of us to reflect on the need for cultural change in these areas and on the need to take into account the hard workers who  are concerned that yet again they will be punished for their hard work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has to be a balance in all of this. We have to send messages that cover fairly both the needs of parents&mdash;their need to be fairly treated in a taxation sense&mdash;and the needs of their children, whom they are trying to put through education and help into training, and so forth. Overall it is a good package, but obviously there is a need to go further in time with these sorts of measures. I urge that the House go down that track.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). In doing so, I indicate that the intent of the Australian Labor Party clearly is to support moves to simplify income support arrangements, including for young people. We are very much opposed to the short&hyphen;sighted decision of this government to withdraw income support from needy people and needy communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly do not support unfair action against some of the most needy people in the Australian community. This is not just about questions of income support; we also regard this as a fairly fundamental debate about equality of opportunity in life and government responsibility. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10720">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) has said several times in this place that the removal of benefits to 16- and 17-year-olds sends a clear message to them. If anything, it is a continuation of a message from this government that the victims are to blame, rather than there being a willingness by this government to accept some responsibility to intervene and to create a sense of equality of opportunity in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The intent of the government, in their terminology, is to send a message that the best way to get a job is to stay at school. This statement implies that 16- and 17-year-olds who leave school early do so as a deliberate, considered and rational choice to gain short-term dollars. How reality is far from the view of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That approach flies in the face of the reality, demonstrated by research, that these people leave school early for other reasons. They leave, for example, because of emotional or family difficulties, for reasons of school disadvantage, or because they are not suited to the school environment. The reasons they leave school early are the very reasons they need extra support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should not be a decision by government to actually withdraw support, but perhaps more importantly there should be a requirement by government to consider how they can give more support to these disadvantaged people&mdash;members of disadvantaged families and members of disadvantaged communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That additional support ought to include income support rather than the extra pressure that this government is now placing on individuals in the Australian community who need a helping hand. They do not need handouts but a helping hand to give them encouragement to stay at school and fulfil their capacity. In doing so, it will create better opportunities not just for them and their families but also for the nation at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Removal of benefits will not address the causes of the problem at hand. That is what we ought to be debating today&mdash;the causes of the problem at hand and how we as a national parliament can seek to overcome some of those causes, rather than blaming the victims 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of those causes of disadvantage. I suggest that many people forced off unemployment payments are likely to turn to crime and other sources of income rather than go back into the classroom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the Australian community ought to be concerned about today: what is potentially the end result of the withdrawal of this assistance, as suggested by the bill before the House today? It is no good blaming the victims of the disappearance of entry level jobs for the fact that these jobs no longer exist, and that is the root cause of some of the problems that currently confront young people in the Australian community today. Twenty or 30 years ago, there were entry level jobs to take up in a variety of occupations in both the public and the private sector and those young people were potentially and, as history shows, exceptionally good workers. They fulfilled the requirements of their employer and also fulfilled the expectations of the Australian community&mdash;workers that were willing to put in often not for a higher return when it came to access to decent wages and conditions of employment but people who were satisfied with the employment opportunity that they were given and satisfied with the wages and conditions and the additional assistance given to low income people in the Australian community by successive governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issue today is not how we withdraw benefits from those people but how we go about creating additional employment opportunities, especially entry level jobs, for those people in the future. It is a fact, whether people like it or not, that not every young person currently has the capacity for or is suited to staying on at school for years 11 and 12. Some of us might like to think that would be an ideal situation for the Australian community to achieve, but the facts are that it will never be achieved. It is pie in the sky for a variety of reasons and, irrespective of our ideals or objectives in life, we have to face up to the fact that, in a community so complex as the Australian community, the responsibility of government is to create a variety of opportunities to suit the needs and aspirations of a variety of people in that community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore refer to the fact that many young people need, for example, counselling support 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10721"> from qualified psychologists. Properly equipped programs need to be available in and through the school to address these people's family and emotional difficulties and to encourage them to remain at school. Young people need proper work oriented careers education when they are at school, not the withdrawal of benefits; they need expanded work experience opportunities while they are at school. In that context, the type of young person that I am actually talking about is, unfortunately, not the type of person that actually gets those part&hyphen;time or casual employment opportunities at their McDonald's&mdash;the type of fast&hyphen;food activities that  the current minister for employment is consumed with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the kids who are going to lose benefits as a result of this bill are the kids that are doing it tough: the kids from disadvantaged homes, the kids from disadvantaged schools, the kids from disadvantaged suburbs, the kids from disadvantaged regions, the people who do not expect the casual and the part&hyphen;time employment opportunities that are not normally available to them. It is therefore the responsibility of government to actually create better opportunities for those young people, and that is what the debate today is about. Those young people actually need expanded work experience opportunities while they are at school. They need, for example, expanded school to work transition programs which create pathways for them to enter the work force. They need the expansion of existing programs to occur along the lines of the jobs pathway guarantee program, which was introduced by the Labor Party in government in 1995.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LS4">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What it is really about&mdash;and I note that some on the other side laugh at that suggestion&mdash;is a real reciprocal obligation, not the Howard government's one-sided, narrow&hyphen;minded, mean&hyphen;fisted concept of blame the victim, which is so much part and parcel of the approach of government in this House to the needs of disadvantaged people in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The jobs pathway program was piloted in schools located in the regions of highest youth unemployment and was earmarked for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expansion prior to the last election. What do we get from this government? We get Green Corps. Talk about assisting young disadvantaged people! It is interesting to note that the majority of people who have had access to Green Corps to date have come from the better communities. The majority have either had employment or have just finished studies. The real disadvantaged are offered by this government work for the dole without a real reciprocal obligation and without a two&hyphen;way approach: the government offering resources in return for individuals fronting up to their responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has revamped this program as the jobs pathway program and has expanded it slightly. At least it is to be commended for that. However, the funding increase in the other school to work funding initiatives undertaken by the Howard government has been completely negated by other actions of the Howard government such as, for example, chopping 117,000 places in labour market programs for young people and the decline in case management for young unemployed under the new, chaotic employment services market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Early school leaving, I suggest, is intimately connected with homelessness amongst young people. Therefore the level of resources for the job placement, employment and training program&mdash;which aims to help young people overcome problems preventing them from maintaining stable accommodation and entering into full&hyphen;time education, training and employment&mdash;must be considered as part of this debate. What was formerly called the young homeless allowance, and other relevant social security payments, must also be considered. General community back&hyphen;up measures to tackle the underlying problems of youth homelessness and family breakdown should also be part of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approach of giving out McDonald's hamburger training certificates to secondary students who work part time is not the solution. Labor clearly supports properly designated vocational links to schools. We support the part&hyphen;time work currently done by many secondary students counting towards appropriate qualifications, but we must be clear that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10722"> there are several clearly distinct groups among the young unemployed. I go, for example, to the early school leavers looking for full&hyphen;time jobs who are most at risk of not making a successful transition to economic independence. I also refer to the young people still at school doing part&hyphen;time jobs who have much better prospects. These difficult issues have got to be raised in a debate such as this. You cannot sweep them under the carpet and pretend that they do not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem for the more at&hyphen;risk groups is that apprenticeships, contrary to what the minister would have you believe, are rapidly falling in number under the Howard government. They declined by more than 2,000 in the last year for which figures are available. This figure is consistently drawn out in Senate estimates. That drop of 2,000 in apprenticeships comes at a time of emerging skill shortages in a variety of sectors&mdash;not just the manufacturing sector but also the services sector across Australia. So much for this government's commitment and ability to create additional apprenticeship opportunities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that note, I would also refer to a recent survey which shows, unfortunately, that, because of the poor state of the economy and lack of government incentives, only one in five companies now plans to increase its apprenticeship numbers. The new minister has cut funds for apprenticeships and wasted money on promoting himself. That was even revealed in Senate estimates last week. There was money available to put glossy photos of the minister in promotional material handed out by the department while the actual amount of money for vocational education and training was cut in the last 20 months in successive Howard government budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what it is about: the promotion of the minister. Funds were cut for vocational education and training while the minister wasted hard&hyphen;earned taxpayers' money on putting glossy photos of himself in government and departmental information kits. So much for this minister's priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, skill shortages need to be filled and young unemployed Australians desperately want to be properly trained to fill 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them. In the first two Howard budgets $270 million has been cut from vocational education and training. The rate of growth in traineeships has also dramatically slowed. Labor will boost investment in apprenticeships and traineeships to give quality skills training to those who leave school early and to enhance their future job prospects. We will also commit ourselves to reversing the neglect into which the TAFE institutes are  currently falling. We will promote TAFE as just as good an option as university for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a positive approach to government job creation, Labor will also help make up for this government's removal of the career path which so many young people sought to pursue in the Australian Public Service. A positive approach to get all young people into education, training or work will be pursued, consistent with the active programs of assistance to unemployed Australians previously implemented under Working Nation and based on the real principle of reciprocal obligation, which is entirely different to the watered down, one&hyphen;sided approach of mutual obligation which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is so much identified with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate on this Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill it is important that we put the number of 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who now leave school early into the proper context. In March 1983 the Labor government inherited from the then Treasurer, who is now the Prime Minister, 158,000 young unemployed people. That is 158,000 teenagers looking for full&hyphen;time work, the highest number ever in the history of this great nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, when Labor left office in March last year, that figure had been cut to 91,400, due largely to a massive rise in secondary school retention rates. Only four in 10 young people stayed on at school to year 12 at the time the Prime Minister was Treasurer in 1983. By the end of the 13 years of Labor in March of last year more than seven in 10 did so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was partly because of the massive expansion of higher education places under Labor. It was also partly because of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10723"> promotion of technical and further education as a viable alternative for those who do not want to go to university. It is a fact of life that not everyone wants to go to university. There is a place in the Australian community for TAFE on an equal footing with university education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also partly a response to the disappearance of jobs for young people, especially those entry level jobs. The rise in school retention rates to unprecedented levels reflected a recognition by these students that they needed to complete their schooling to improve their chances of getting a job. That is what it was all about&mdash;the structure of work has changed in Australia. Education and training is the key to the best employment opportunity in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who still leave school early in these times of reduced job opportunities for the young are the most at risk of becoming young unemployed people. They are young people for whom socio&hyphen;economic, family or personal circumstances have overridden what, in an ideal world, would, rationally, be in their self&hyphen;interest&mdash;to stay at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One more positive, innovative way to help meet the needs of this group is for an expansion of the mentor scheme. These emerging programs enable older Australians to pass on the benefits of their accumulated wisdom and experience to young people. I commit myself as the minister to expanding and consolidating such an approach to assisting young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also proposes to means test the unemployment payments of 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. The intention is to reduce unemployment payments for 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who live at home, from the moment their parents' combined income rises above&mdash;wait for it&mdash;the very low level of $23,400. You are hardly going to make a fortune as a family on $23,400 a year, and yet you are now expected to accept that your children are not independent. The bill also proposes to cut the 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds off payment altogether if they live at home with parents whose income amounts to the modest figure of $41,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means&hyphen;testing measure will hit many low and middle income families very hard. It disregards the fact that in working class 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> families kids are expected and need to contribute to the household income. It contradicts the legal age of independence for young people being 18. You can vote and fight for the country but you cannot be classed as independent of your parents at the age of 18 by the Howard government. That is, in fact, the real age at which many young people become economically independent. Like so much of Dr Kemp's handiwork, this bill is more about diddling and fixing the youth unemployment figures than it is about helping out with youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cabinet received a submission from the department outlining the positive measures it needed to take to tackle the problems of early school leavers and youth unemployment. They were the same kind of positive measures I put forward today. This government chose to ignore those positive proposals, independently developed and assessed by the department, and instead tried to push more young people into poverty and despair. That is what this is really about: poverty and despair for young people and their families and difficulties at schools and in disadvantaged suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the second reading amendment moved by the member for Werriwa. The path the government has chosen so far as we are concerned is wrong. We urge an alternative path. We accept there is a problem, but the alternative path is one based on real reciprocal obligation&mdash;a real partnership between the community and the government; a real partnership between the community and the young unemployed; a real partnership between the government, the community, the young unemployed and their families&mdash;not finger pointing and blaming the victim as this bill seeks to do, but a government actually willing to assist by intervening, going to those homes, schools and suburbs and saying, `We accept there are real problems. Withdrawing benefits is not the solution. It is about the role of government in providing decent school opportunities.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose it is as much of a relief to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as it is to me to hear the end of the vitriol, selective recall of history and romanticisation of the things Labor thought it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10724"> might have done if only it had a fourteenth year in government. The shadow minister seeks to pat himself on the back for things this government has actually done, that this government has put in place and the programs it has initiated, while he seeks to have a revisionist historian look, with a touch of romance sprinkled on top, at the things the Labor Party did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, this government is doing things that are needed to address the sorts of things the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) spoke of. For about 18&half; minutes he spoke of things unrelated to this bill and things unrelated to the financial support available to young people in this country. He ranted and raved about his hibernation&hyphen;like thoughts on what has been going on in the world, because he has missed a lot of things that this government has actually done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman tried to talk up the crisis that is occurring for disadvantaged people in this country and kids that come from disadvantaged schools. For the member for Batman's interest, I am a person who came from a disadvantaged school and I can let him know the sorts of things that are actually being done by this government not to perpetuate the situation of the disadvantaged, but to try and avoid or prevent it and try to encourage young people to think about their futures and look beyond what Labor had left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under that system you actually got more money for being on the dole. You were financially better off by not investing in your future, not looking for work, not training and not thinking beyond what money you might want to spend in the pinball parlour this week. You were better off if you were not doing those things. If you thought, `I will sit back and receive the income support that the taxpayers in the electorate of Dunkley and the rest of the nation provide. I will not think about what it is that is in my best longer term interests.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not doubt for one moment that the member for Batman feels their disadvantage in a heartfelt manner. Not only do I feel that same touch of grief about some of the people in our country who are not enjoying the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opportunities that this great nation has to offer, but I actually think we should do something about it, and not just sit in here and wring our hands as the member for Batman seeks to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirteen years of Labor robbed many young people of the incentive to take up further study and to take up further training to improve their employment prospects and their prospects for future life, because you were better off not do to those things. Young people leaving school had a confusing array of different payments, but the most disturbing thing is that young people were actually financially better off to go on the dole rather than invest in their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeking to change that. Through this youth allowance package before the parliament we are introducing a fairer system of income support for all Australians. It is one that does not discriminate against people who are investing in their future, which is the system we inherited from the Labor Party. It is a system that does not discriminate against those who are unemployed or in education or training. It levels out those arrangements, so that young people will be encouraged to think about their futures and take part in the sorts of opportunities this government is providing for young people and will actually invest in a longer term advantage to them, rather than&mdash;as the member for Batman seems to prefer&mdash;leave them in a situation of disadvantage and not do anything actively or not encourage them to do anything actively to do anything about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman talks about the lack of entry level jobs in this country. And what is his solution? To create more unskilled positions for unskilled people in an unskilled economy. What sort of solution is that? That is a solution taking us down the path of economic misery and lost opportunities for this country, but that is the member for Batman's solution. While we are trying to help create skilled jobs and trying to support young people to develop the skills to take on those jobs, the member for Batman is saying, `No. Let's not skill anybody. Let's just create a low&hyphen;skill economy with low wages, low opportunity and low competitiveness so the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10725"> rest of the world walks over us and we all become disadvantaged.' What a wonderful solution!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He failed to mention&mdash;and I would be interested to know what his reaction is to this&mdash;whether Labor still wants to get away from and abolish junior pay rates. One thing was missed by young people throughout this country when we were having the workplace relations debate. There was an important provision in that bill and that bill&mdash;which is now law&mdash;said, `We will continue to provide for junior wages in this country.' Labor had junior wages disappearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people looking for a start in life without work experience and the competencies and skills employers were looking for in areas such as the retail sector were going to be asking for the same rate of pay as seasoned sales personnel who had been in that business and on the shop floor making a productive contribution to businesses for perhaps decades. Labor said, `We will feel good about this. We will play the cruelest trick on young people by denying them access to a junior wage.' It is the cruelest trick because that denies many young people an opportunity to get a start in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the retail sector alone hundreds of thousands of young people would have lost their jobs had this government not understood the cruel hoax those opposite&mdash;and those that the member for Batman seeks to romanticise and rejoice&mdash;were trying to deny hundreds of thousands of young people a start in life because they thought we would rule out junior wage rates. That is the cruelest hoax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rest of what the member for Batman had to say was celebrating what this government is doing. The package before the parliament today is part of a broad&hyphen;ranged, multifaceted strategy to give new hope and opportunity to young people. The member for Batman talks about jobs pathways. This government is doing something about jobs pathways. In the electorate of that I represent the Peninsula Institute of TAFE is working with secondary colleges right throughout my electorate to help people make that transition from school to work and to aid them, assist them and support them to take advantage of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the opportunities that are there. That is being done. That is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman is now retrospectively trying to create the impression that he likes vocational education. Yet he is part of a side of politics that for 13 years said, `If you are not in a university you do  not count. If your skills are vocationally based, we will make it as hard as we possibly can for employers to give you a start in life. But if you go to university we will celebrate that and we will keep pouring bucket loads of money into the higher education sector, primarily the university sector.' Meanwhile, vocational education drifted away and we ended up with the lowest rate of apprenticeships and trade qualified people in this country since the war. And he stands up and talks about creating a low&hyphen;skilled economy as the answer for young people. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. That is absolutely the last thing young people in this country want: a low&hyphen;skill economy where they are not given the opportunity to develop the skills. That is your answer? That is the great Labor Party solution to a problem it turned its back on? What a pathetic contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only new idea the member for Batman had to offer was a mentoring scheme. I would support him on that. There are an enormous number of mature age people with great skills in the work force who could offer support for young people. I celebrate that contribution, member for Batman. It is a good idea. It is an idea that Lions Clubs in my electorate have been putting in place for almost a decade. Congratulations for catching on; the hibernation must have ended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition before the parliament today is about designing a system that makes investing in your future more attractive for young people. From 1 July next year, the youth allowance will replace unemployment benefits, Austudy, Abstudy, traineeships, wage top&hyphen;ups&mdash;I think 13 different payments are being folded into five so you can actually find your way around them. This is so there is no discrimination against people investing in their future. It is intended to ease the transition from study, training and searching for employment, and to recognise that there 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10726"> is some overlap between these different categories of people. It is part of a comprehensive plan for young people. Since the government was elected 18 months ago, we have put in place a plan. This is part of that plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken on other parts of the plan in terms of developing literacy skills so people can read and write. Without those core competencies, how can you participate in the opportunities the government is making available? They are core life skills but, again, the member for Batman did not mention those because Labor turned their back on that. That is why we are doing something about it. He runs down programs like Green Corps, where young people can gain a work ethic, where they can participate in projects within their community, be recognised for that extra effort and get a stipend at the end of it to help them go on to further education studies. He runs that down too. People in my electorate on the Seaford foreshore think it is a wonderful project, and so does the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a work for the dole program that Labor hated&mdash;then they changed their mind. They must have checked the polls or something. They take a poll driven approach over there&mdash;new Labor. It is not new Labor, it is old Labor with a face job and a change of hair colour. They said they hated work for the dole, then they went with it. Why? Why is work for the dole right? Many young people, sadly, come from households where their parents have not worked for many years. You do not pick up a work ethic by osmosis. You need the opportunity to work in a workplace with other people to understand what commitment and contribution to a team are about, working in team areas and getting up on mornings when you do not feel like it, which many of us do every day of our lives. Work for the dole is giving people an opportunity to gain that workplace experience and understanding, and to further improve their employment prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the celebrated greatness of the Labor Party in promoting higher education. We have created more places in higher education. More people enrolled in universities this year than ever before. More money is being 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> spent in universities than ever before. More TAFE places are available than ever before. And the minister is working with state governments to widen that even further. That is part of a comprehensive plan to make sure there are real opportunities there. This bill is part of that package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman talked about the disadvantaged people and how this is going to discriminate against them. He obviously has not read the bill. He obviously has not understood the things this government has been doing since it was elected 18 months ago. We have a jobs placement, education and training program for people at risk. It operates in my electorate. The Salvation Army operate it through the Burnt Toast Cafe in Mornington. This is a half a million dollar commitment to young people who are at risk, whether they are homeless or have been abused, and where they are the most disadvantaged people in our community. Here is a program through which this government is saying, `We are here to support you in finding employment, further education or training if that is what you need, and to help you deal with some of life's circumstances or those circumstances that led you to be in this disadvantaged situation.' The member for Batman has missed that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned work for the dole briefly. We have three projects down in my electorate: Mount Eliza regional park and the Mornington Railway Preservation Society are combining to work on a project at Moorooduc; some shoppers' guide activity&mdash;and understand that our economy is very much about the retail sector; and some work at Studio Park, Sweetwater Creek and some landscaping activities. So those opportunities are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing the member for Batman did not speak of, though, was that if you leave school at year 10 you are three times more likely to be unemployed. What are we trying to do? We are trying to encourage people to understand that and to think about what that means. The area consultative committee in my electorate was so concerned about it that they have conducted a pilot program where they grab young people out of local secondary schools and talk with them about what the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10727"> real world is like. They are saying to these young people, `You may think school is a drag but if you leave at year 10 you are three times more likely to be unemployed. And if you are looking at buying, as I did when I left school, a Mazda 800 super deluxe coupe, somehow you have  to pay for it. If you want to aspire to those things that every young person enjoys as they grow up through life then you need to look at how you can secure the opportunities and the means to do those things.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They ask young people to think about what it is they have to offer an increasingly competitive workplace. This is the same workplace the member for Batman wants to throw back to an unskilled economy so unskilled people can get low&hyphen;paid, low&hyphen;satisfaction jobs. But that is not the economy we are working for; we are working for a higher skilled economy. We are supporting people in developing those skills to be a part of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are three times more likely to be unemployed if you leave school at year 10. That is not something that most people think about. That is something that under Labor was rewarded; you got more money when you left school than if you stayed on to study. That is disgraceful. That is what this program is about recognising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Council for Educational Research in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth profile 3 </EMPHASIS>published last year shows that between the 1980s and early 1990s year 12 completion rates for girls with a father who was born in an English speaking country rose from 49.9 per cent to 59.6 per cent. For girls with fathers born in non&hyphen;English speaking nations, the figure rose from 57.8 per cent to 74.6 per cent. You are increasingly seeing an understanding in the community that staying on at school makes sense and developing your skills makes sense because we are in a skilled economy&mdash;unlike what the member for Batman wants to create: an unskilled, low paid, poor job prospects, low skilled people economy. That is not the thing we want here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Arguably some of the relative success of independent schools is because they have understood this connection and have built it into their fabric. We have said also in our

What is wrong with a parent deciding that the start in life their young children get, the opportunities that this produces, the teaching practice, the styles, the morality&mdash;whatever the case may be, whatever the reason may be&mdash;is in their child's best interests in an independent school? What is wrong with that? This government has understood the importance of that choice for parents and is continuing to make sure that resources are made available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am continually stressing to school students, teachers, parents and employers around the area just how important vocational options are because in the electorate I represent more than 70 per cent of people do not go on to university.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) has forgotten about the rain on the Mornington Peninsula, as well. Like much of this government's legislation over the last 20 months, this <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997</XREF>  denies help to those who most need it. Contrary to its election promise that nobody would be worse off under a Howard government, unnecessary hardship has been imposed on the members of the very sectors of the community most in need of assistance and support. For example, older Australians are being punished by this government in a number of ways, including the withdrawal of the Commonwealth dental health program, the increase in prescription charges, the slashing of expenditure on home and community services, the change in the deeming amounts, the cuts to Australian Hearing Services and by the latest debacle over nursing homes. Aus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10729"> tralian families who require child care are being punished by the reduction in the child&hyphen;care cash rebate, by the caps to access to child&hyphen;care assistance and by the abolition of subsidies for community based long day care&mdash;all of which mean greater cost for families trying to make ends meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working people have been punished by the virtual abandonment of Australia's unique award system and other changes to industrial relations law, which have served to increase insecurity in the workplace, to make favourites of creditors and negatives of debtors, who are most of us. Young people seeking to advance themselves through education have been punished through massive cuts to tertiary education funding, by the reduction in Austudy expenditure and by changes in HECS. Those who are out of work have been punished by this government's abandonment of Labor's $1.8 billion worth of labour market programs, which provided invaluable work experience along with the opportunity to retrain for new careers. In addition, the government has cut $183 million from vocational education and training in the 1996 budget and followed it up recently with a further cut of $14.3 million from vocational and industry training and another $72 million from education and training grants to the states. What hope can young people have when the government consistently demonstrates that it has not a care in the world for their interests?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Add to this the severe cuts in schools funding by the South Australian government, resulting in school closures precisely in those areas where they are most needed. This is a direct breach of its election undertaking. These opportunities for young people vanished with the callous closure of these schools. To exacerbate the problems facing job seekers, cuts to public sector employment by both state and federal government have denied young people job opportunities in the one area where young people have traditionally got a start. Fortunately, that was acknowledged in the report by the committee chaired by the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) on employment opportunities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in this climate of continued high unemployment, a lack of any serious legislative program to assist the jobless and a pattern of legislative punishment for those who are most in need that the government has introduced into this House its Social Security Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997. This bill continues the pattern of punishing those who are most in need of assistance. It imposes real and unnecessary hardship on those 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Australians who have not finished year 12 and who are looking for work, on those 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;old young Australians who are unable to find a job and on their families. These are precisely the groups of young people who already have the greatest difficulty getting a start in the current market; the ones who already face the harshest barriers to participation in education, training and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not to say that the current array of income support for young people is not in need of simplification and reform. Some aspects of this bill do deserve support, namely, the increases in rates of payment for some young people, an improved flexibility which allows young people to combine part&hyphen;time study with jobsearch and other activities, the extension of rent assistance to full&hyphen;time students who are required to live away from home for study related reasons and payment of the higher independent rate for full&hyphen;time students in de facto relationships of more than two years standing. The concept of the youth allowance, one designed to simplify the system of payments for young people, to remove disincentives for young people to continue their education and to remove inconsistencies between payments for young people and other social security payments, is not being challenged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A simplified system is desirable. The problem is that this bill does not achieve these aims. It does nothing to reduce complexity; in fact, it introduces new complexities. For example, it introduces arrangements which exacerbate disincentives to continue education, directly contrary to its stated aims, and arrangements which are inconsistent with the provisions of the Social Security Act. But, most importantly, it fails to do anything about 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10730"> the most serious problem facing this country today&mdash;that of unemployment, and youth unemployment in particular. The Victorian Liberal Minister for Training recently said that the former federal Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, now the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs  (Dr Kemp), was more interested in his personal publicity than he was in putting young people into a job. What hope does this give young people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth unemployment rate, which John Howard claimed to be his highest priority and which he promised to reduce, has in fact risen since he has been in office. Further, the number of traditional four&hyphen;year trade apprenticeships has also fallen by around 2,000. Yet this bill will withdraw income support for 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Australians who leave education without completing year 12. As a consequence, they will not qualify for any of the education labour market assistance or any other program which might assist their transition from school to the workplace. This group of young people has been cruelly abandoned by this government at the very time that it has made substantial cuts to education and labour market programs, at the very time when entry level jobs continue to disappear, particularly in the public sector at state and federal level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made no effort to seek a solution to the problems facing these young people. It has simply decided to punish them. If the government cared about the fate of young people, it could have introduced a number of measures along with the youth allowance: for example, measures which support early intervention to prevent young people leaving education before finishing year 12, measures to improve the access or affordability of post&hyphen;school education and measures to create entry level jobs for unemployed young people, particularly in the public sector. It has done none of these, which is further evidence that the government is not serious about tackling the problem. Rather, this is a strategy to punish the victim&mdash;the unempowered young person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will force young people to remain at school in order to get an income, yet it has not provided any additional funds to schools 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to cope with the expected influx of 25,000 to 27,000 additional students. The extra allocation required by schools to help meet the needs of their students would not be so great, at around perhaps $140 million. It would only be a small fraction of the amount the Commonwealth spends each year on the schools program. Yet this bill provides for no additional funding at all&mdash;nil, zero. Because of this, schools will have to spread their resources more thinly and additional hardships will be placed on every student in the school system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only reasonable conclusion, therefore, is that this bill has been designed to have two main aims: firstly, to artificially reduce the youth unemployment rate by forcing young people to stay on at school in order to get an income and, secondly, to effectively reduce spending on schools. These, as I hope most members in this House would admit, are fairly cynical aims for nothing but political ends, and neither is in the interests of young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What young people need from this government is the right training and skills, and properly funded schools to deliver these. They need from the government proper work oriented careers education, expanded work experience, and expanded school to work transition programs to create opportunities for them to enter the work force. When going around to our secondary schools in this country it is quite common to find one careers adviser&mdash;and often it is the one who gets the short straw&mdash;for 1,200 students. That is just physically and totally unacceptable, and it simply cannot be met. No one person can give careers advice to 1,200 young people; it is simply not possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people need the government to reinstate and expand the students at risk program, which was specifically designed to identify and assist young people at risk of leaving school early. Young people need the government to restore the specific equity programs for disadvantaged schools, with a commitment of additional resources and specialised programs. People can argue in this place that this is not a resource argument. It is a resource argument, it has always been a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10731"> resource argument and it will continue to be a resource argument in the future. Young people need the government to guarantee funding for the jobs pathway program and the facilitation of school and industry partnerships at a local level, to assist those schools most likely to be affected by the youth allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people need the government to provide additional funding for the school education system so that it can provide customised learning opportunities to encourage students to stay on at school and find avenues into the work force. And young people need the government to make a solid investment in apprenticeships and traineeships so that they can be given quality skills training to enhance their future job prospects. Yet this bill provides none of these measures&mdash;just punishment for those young people who will find it most difficult to find a job with decent wages and a rewarding career. It is these very same young people who would benefit most from the assistance which can be provided under case management arrangements. `Case management arrangements'&mdash;doesn't it make you pull your hair out. Case management for the young unemployed has been neglected by this government under the new chaotic employment services market, and 117,000 places in labour market programs have simply been chopped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of this legislation which is also of concern relates to the eligibility provisions for the youth allowance&mdash;in particular, the question of when young people will be eligible for the independent rate of the allowance. The bill imposes a parental income, assets and means test for young unemployed people aged under 21, with government support for families with young people being reduced if those families' incomes amount to over $23,400 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that families should support young people until they are independent. But why choose the age of 21? Young people are civilly and criminally responsible from no later than 18 years of age, the legal obligation to pay child support ceases once a child turns 18 and eligibility for the family tax initiative ceases once a child turns 18; yet unless an unemployed person under the age 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of 21 can demonstrate independence eligibility for payment will be determined on the basis of their parents' means. Measures in this bill make it very difficult for young people to qualify as independent, which will have the effect of reducing the level of assistance available for  young unemployed people, particularly in low income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the very families already struggling to make ends meet in the wake of the government's first two budgets. The young people who leave school early are generally those from lower income areas. Why is this government blind to the needs of these young people? Is it because the government collectively has little idea of the hardships these young people face?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister claims that the bill sends a message to young people that to stay at school is the best way to get a job&mdash;a claim which demonstrates only that the minister has very little idea, and perhaps little care, about why some young people leave school early. The decision to leave early is not, in most cases, a deliberate, considered or even a rational choice in order to gain a wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Early school leaving is generally connected with family or emotional difficulties, or social disadvantage of some description. It is precisely for this reason that they need extra support, including income support, rather than the additional pressure the measures in this bill places upon them. Simply to remove their sources of income support, as this bill does, does not go to the core of the problem. It is not a genuine attempt at a solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of these young people who will be forced off unemployment payments as a result of this bill will not return to school; they may be tempted to turn to crime and other sources of income instead, with consequent undesirable results for their lives and for the community generally. We acknowledge&mdash;and everyone here in this House should acknowledge&mdash;that there are very few jobs available for unskilled teenagers and that it is therefore desirable that young people be encouraged to stay on at school as long as possible to realise the benefits of education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's approach to the problem is consistent with the principles of reciprocal responsi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10732"> bility; that is, that young people should make the best use of the opportunities available to them in education and employment and that the government provides the public services that are required. Labor will broaden the availability and range of opportunities in education and training, particularly for teenagers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody wants young people to be on welfare&mdash;Labor, the government or the young people concerned. However, the answer to this problem is not to wind back the role of government; it is to actively seek to create new opportunities through education and training. Young people need this government to reinstate the $240 million it has cut from the funding of the TAFE system; and they need the government to provide the school system with additional funds to help schools cope with the influx of new students which this bill will cause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that these and other measures are not being taken is evidence that this bill is not designed in the interests of young school leavers but rather in the political interests of the government itself. It is a cynical attempt to hide the most serious problem this country faces&mdash;that of youth unemployment. And it will not work. It will not convince anybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill&mdash;and this is where it is essentially wrong&mdash;does not seek a solution. There is no solution sought. It is merely an attempt to cover its tracks as it withdraws. Young people deserve better than this. The government is pulling out of the fight against the very problem its leader in the lead-up to the last election described as his `No. 1 priority'. If youth unemployment was the No. 1 priority, God help us with all the rest because this government&mdash;except perhaps for its big bang on the gun laws&mdash;has been steadily going downhill ever since. People out there in the electorate are beginning to wake up. Perhaps they welcome the opportunity of a new election to make sure that a government that promised and promised and failed to deliver will get its just desserts. Other governments around the world have finished up with the same fate because they did the same thing.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill</XREF> . Like most of the legislation that the Howard government has introduced, it is a very practical, commonsense approach to helping solve the mess left behind by the Labor Party. The previous government failed many sectors of the community&mdash;small business, older Australians and families&mdash;but none more so than the youth of Australia. Under Labor, youth unemployment reached a staggering 32.3 per cent and, worse still, in many regional areas the level was close to 50 per cent. Under Labor, apprenticeships fell to their lowest ever in 30 years. Under Labor, children were encouraged through financial incentives to leave school and go straight on the dole. Under Labor, literacy levels declined to such a low level that a recent study found that 30 per cent of all 14-year-old children cannot read and write properly&mdash;that is, 10 students in a class of 30.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to place on record my support for the stand that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) has taken to improve literacy in order to provide a better future for our children. This minister is steadfast in his determination to tackle a problem the Labor Party left in the too-hard basket for so many years. He can be assured that the many parents in Forde whom I have spoken to in the past few months wholeheartedly support him and recognise the need for national standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, young Australians, along with their hopes and aspirations, were a very low priority. The saddest thing is that when Labor failed Australia's young people it failed the whole family unit. Contrary to the views of some in the Labor Party, our children do not instantly become adults the moment they celebrate their 16th birthday. The vast majority of 16-year-olds are still part of a caring family unit. That must be remembered when we are making laws in this place. It seems such a simple point, yet it is precisely the point that the Labor Party has ignored for so long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the 12 months leading up to the last election I was approached by so many parents in Ford con cerned and angry that their role as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10733"> parents was constantly being undermined. They felt disenfranchised by the Labor system that sought to replace parents' roles with the local DSS office. It is one of the key reasons why so many traditional Labor voters changed their vote in the last election. The fact that Labor opposes the youth allowance clearly demonstrates that they have not learned from the election results. They are still not listening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is against this background that the coalition government has introduced the new youth allowance. This bill is about delivering a fair deal. Put simply, the youth allowance will replace five different payments with one, and 13 payment rates with just five. It simplifies income support payments for young people and removes the incentive they once had to leave school early or to choose unemployment over education and training. Under the youth allowance, young unemployed people aged 18 to 20 will be subject to a parental means test and treated the same way as full-time students. This arrangement gives parents back the responsibility for their children, which I will talk a little more about later. We give them back this responsibility but we remain flexible so that those people who are disadvantaged, married or parents themselves are not affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the youth allowance, payments to young people under 18 years of age who have to live away from home will be increased, and rent allowance assistance will be extended to students. These measures would particularly benefit those from rural areas. The education leaver waiting period will be abolished, ensuring that young people in lower income families are not left without support for up to three months after they leave school. There are exemptions to the parental means test. In fact, this legislation widens eligibility criteria for independence to make it more realistic and special safety net criteria also ensures that young people over the age of 18 with work force experience will not be disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the point of this bill. It is fair and it reflects our commonsense approach to government. Those opposite rant and rave about equality and talk up a scare campaign 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on this, just as they have done on our nursing home proposals. They have a lot to answer for, given that the misinformation and blatant lies that they spread are causing unnecessary concern to many thousands of older Australians and their families. It is a terrible way to run opposition&mdash;if you have no talent, use the vulnerable in our society. While they talk in shrill tones of `cuts', the changes to the youth allowance are not saving measures at all. We are not cutting the overall budget on this. In the first year additional programs costs alone are expected to be around $25 million. We are ensuring that the system is fairer, that it targets those who need it and, most importantly, that it is geared to truly benefit young people in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not talking about the benefits of a milkshake and movie; I am talking about education and training that will lead to jobs. I am also talking about allowing parents to have a greater role in assisting their children, rather than leading those children to believe that the government owes them a living at 16. Like many Australians, I scratch my head and wonder about the comments of the former Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot, who is now jostling for the Labor Party leadership line&hyphen;up, when she told Australian taxpayers that they have an obligation to pay for milkshakes and movie tickets for Australia's young unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This shows that she has lost touch with what is really important to Australian families: things like jobs and real opportunities for young Australians, to encourage them to be self&hyphen;sufficient and contributing members of our society. Cheryl's idea of self&hyphen;sufficiency is for the Australian taxpayers to give them pocket money so that they do not have to ask their parents. That is not self&hyphen;sufficiency; that is the worst form of reliance. That is teaching our young people that the government owes them and has a fundamental duty to provide for them. They are not being taught responsibility for their own future or the value of a strong work ethic. In that sense, Ms Kernot should feel right at home in the Labor Party. Both the Democrats and the Labor Party initially opposed the government's equally sensible and practical work for the dole 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10734"> scheme, with Labor doing a last minute backflip when they realised the extent of community support out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like this new youth allowance, work for the dole is about restoring positive incentives for young people. It is about creating a system where government payment is seen as the `safety net' that it is meant to be, not the primary and ongoing means of support. I am delighted that the government has nearly tripled the number of recently announced work for the dole pilot programs in response to the huge number of applications received. I am also pleased that two hardworking community groups in my own electorate will be supplying work for the dole programs: Boystown, which is a disadvantaged group&mdash;a group which the opposition say we never look after&mdash;and Phantast who look after street kids. I think that is another terrific angle of looking after the real disadvantaged people. I am so proud that they were given funding to participate in this pilot program.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened with interest to the comments made by the member for Chifley (Mr Price), the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and I am quite sure that they believe exactly what they were saying. They have not had first&hyphen;hand experience of what it is like to rear children on a low income. They have probably been listening to do&hyphen;gooders out there who constantly try to tell our children that the government owes them a living. We hear it in our schools. I guess I would be one of the very few members in this room who could stand up here and talk with first&hyphen;hand experience of how to bring up children on an income of less than $25,000. I am proud to say that I have reared eight children through the Labor Party's regime, but it was a constant battle in getting my children to understand that the symbol of life was not just to accept money but to work for it. This was the work ethic that I gave to my children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When those on the other side talk about rearing children, they say, `How dare you do this to low income people.' I am glad that I have the opportunity, after 13 years of rearing children, to say: how dare you tell young people of Australia that they are entitled to money that they do not deserve? People on low incomes are constantly battling the system to bring up their children in a better way, trying to ensure that they do not fall into the system and become third and fourth generation social security recipients. We have to ensure that children do not expect money for nothing. We should put it back into the hands of the parents who are willing to work hard to ensure that their children have a better future and that they start off with a work ethic that they should work for anything they want in life. The moment we see the younger generation doing that, that is when Australia will get back on its feet.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have studied with interest the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) introducing the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amend 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10735"> ment (Youth Allowance) Bill</XREF> to the House and it seems clear that it is based on the following principles: a perceived need for simplicity in the way income support is paid to young people; a perceived need to remove a supposed existing incentive for young people to leave education early and go on the dole; and a belief that families should support young people until they have achieved financial independence, although that status is nowhere defined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to briefly discuss some of the positive aspects of the bill but then move on to the issues that concern me about the impact that these changes will have. The bill will replace the five youth payments of newstart, Austudy, youth training allowance, sickness allowance and family allowance with a single payment to be known as the common youth allowance. Hopefully, the application process will be simpler and the entitlements and rates of payment will be more uniform, understandable and consistent with the rest of the social security system than the current maze of entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill should remove, for example, the common situation where young people who cease working to undertake study or vice versa will no longer have to wait for some time without any income. However, after dealing first&hyphen;hand in the electorate with cases which have not fitted simply into the current allowance categories, I must say that there is a reason for having different allowances because of the different needs of different groups of people. As the Aged Care Bill and the Austudy actual means test have shown&mdash;and as the social security legislation shows me daily in my electorate&mdash;there are always people who do not fit neatly into the slots provided by even the most complex legislation or regulations. I note the absence of Abstudy from inclusion in this youth allowance. Its exclusion suggests that the government too recognises that different people have different needs that cannot always be catered for under one blanket piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also provide for higher rates of assistance for young recipients, rent assistance for students, pharmaceutical allowance for all those eligible and the family income test 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> appears slightly more generous than that applying under the current Austudy scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because eligible tertiary students will now receive rent assistance as well as being able to earn up to $6,000 per year before their allowance is reduced, they will be the real winners if this bill is introduced as is. However, this improvement must be viewed alongside the illogical increase in the age of independence for students aged from 22 to 25&mdash;that is, of course, if they are able and lucky enough to get a place in a tertiary institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the proposed youth allowance provides more support for those who have to leave home to study or look for work will I hope alleviate some of the extra burden faced by young unemployed people and students who must leave my rural electorate of Calare to pursue employment or studies. However, I note with interest the minister's emphasis that those who `do not need to live away from home' will only be paid an at home rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does this mean, for example, that Matthew Tubman, an extremely talented young trumpeter from Orange, who after going as far as he could with his studies in Orange auditioned and was accepted into the Sydney Conservatorium High School where he is now a student, is only entitled to the home rate of assistance because Austudy is apparently only meant to provide a basic education? Here the case is clear: a country boy is at a disadvantage because he lives west of the sandstone curtain. Sure, if he lived anywhere on Sydney's rail link, he could live at home, but it just so happens that his family lives in Orange so for him in this particular pursuit it is tough luck and it seems he can only get the at home rate. I wonder whether Matthew will now satisfy the needs to live away from home criteria.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope so. If he does not, the government simply will not be sending the right  message to those thousands of young people like him who are trying to extend themselves. In principle, I have no problem with encouraging young people to stay in education as long as possible. I agree with the minister that students leaving school in year 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10736"> 12 are much more likely to be employed than young people who leave school at the end of year 10.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does remove the incentive to leave school early and go on the dole, but does it really provide alternatives to the dole? However, if you are going to force students to stay in school or go to TAFE, you simply must also give the schools and the TAFEs the resources to provide these reluctant students with the type of special attention they need or, in the case of TAFEs, at least the resources to provide enough places for the applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the government's questions and answers sheet on the youth allowance makes no commitment for more funding, simply saying that it will maintain funding in real terms and that states will achieve growth through efficiencies. Let us get real about this. You cannot increase education incentives and hope to provide the wherewithal with mirrors. It needs a real funding commitment, and that is the missing link in this plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me briefly digress to some other missing links. While this government is so anxious to try to blame the unemployed and brag about the welfare cheats it has caught, let us not forget that after almost 20 years of rhetoric and labour market programs by governments of both persuasions, topped off by a pathetic `blame the victim' approach in the work for the dole, how about concentrating on our obligations to the young rather than theirs to us?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth unemployment is a result of the actions and policies of the adults. In 1980, 84 per cent of 15&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds were in full-time employment. In 1996 it was 35 per cent. On current trends, there will be no full-time work for 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds by 2001. Quality training is one side of the equation for making kids employable. Providing jobs through a coherent economic policy is the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need tax reform to enable those people who are struggling on $25,000 to bring up their kids. We need tax reform to enable them to do it. We need to look at tax free thresholds perhaps of $10,000. We need tax reform urgently. We need increased investment in social and physical infrastructure, particularly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by government, and a maintenance of key job protecting tariff structures, not right across the board. Let us not pull up the drawbridge. We need to look critically and not throw it all open to the questionable benefits of free trade. We need reregulation of the financial system to the extent of promoting more productive investment, directed superannuation investment, greater tax offsets and other support measures for primary industries value adding and an active industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry by and large, especially in my electorate, has abandoned traineeships and apprenticeships. That loss has fallen to the smaller employers who are doing their bit but still find the cost of apprentices a burden. In 1970 apprentice builders got 15 per cent of the adult wage. Today it is 40 per cent. That might be okay if major companies were absorbing those costs, but they are not; it is left largely to the small operator. That is where the new traineeship and apprenticeship program might run aground. Small business cannot afford the costs or the hassles, no matter how flexible these schemes are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope I am wrong, but I can see danger signs after a discussion about apprenticeships that I had last week with small business operators who attended the launch of the new employment placement organisation of the CES, to be renamed something else in the near future. The message I got is that it is still too dear and the impediments to employing young people are still too great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While larger companies are hell&hyphen;bent on dividends and profits, it seems that the responsibility for any employment creation is filtering down to small business at a rapid rate where there is still a conscience about this. As a builder told me in Bathurst the other night, it costs him $61,000 per annum for two apprentices&mdash;unrealistic wages plus add-on costs. He is prepared to do it still because he is committed to young people and the future of his industry and his nation. But he is becoming a decreasing factor in this whole equation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why don't we require larger companies, which are rapidly downsizing and outsourcing to contractors, to have a ratio of apprenticeships and traineeships on a consistent basis? 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10737"> Then we might have something to offer our young apprentices or tertiary graduates. Then we might prevent that trend to no full-time work for the young. The most excitement I see in the apprenticeship program in my neck of the woods is the now fairly longstanding group apprenticeship scheme. That really is a patchwork quilt. It works well because the small employer can only employ a part apprentice, and so they are shared around to a large degree. We need full&hyphen;time apprenticeships like we used to have, but we do not have them now. Although I will support it to the hilt, I am not convinced that the new apprenticeship and traineeship program is going to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the House of Representatives committee report on youth employment, some 7,000 skilled tradespeople, managers and engineers will need to be imported to meet skill requirements in Western Australian development projects between 1998 and 2000. That is the tragic fact. The 1997&hyphen;98 budget cut vocational and industry training by $14.3 million and took $72 million from education and training grants to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit ripe to say to 16&hyphen; to 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, `You have to be in full&hyphen;time education or training to get your allowance,' and then limit the number of TAFE places available to these young people. By doing this you are, in effect, saying to these people, `You're obliged to attend TAFE or whatever, but the government is not obliged to provide you with a place.' It is a catch&hyphen;22. I read early this year that the Australian TAFEs rejected 60,000 applicants for study this year. I heard the member for Longman (Mr Brough) say in this debate that tertiary places were oversubscribed this year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Am I correct? I am quite sure that I am. I note that you deliberately decide not to answer that every university place. . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">he was talking to the members on the other side&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . was actually oversubscribed. Where is the lack of education? Where is the lack of places?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I fail to see his logic. That they were oversubscribed by a factor of 60,000 is the very point of the argument: the places just are not there.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nation and our young people are crying out for some openings, some vision from the government, some innovation and some hope for the future. That can come with more education spending for the able, not less, and more case management for the at risk&mdash;those unable to cope with traditional education. We have only 10,000 places in the work for the dole scheme, a very skinny Green Corps program, and the blame for this situation is brought about by the economic policies and technological developments which have made our traditional concepts of work and careers redundant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will punish some young people who are victims of our inability to provide work. It will punish their families by forcing them to support their grown&hyphen;up children, whether they are studying or not, until they are financially independent. It is those lower middle&hyphen;class families which will be worst hit by this bill; those whose income is right on or just over the benchmarks. It is not as though families with combined adjusted incomes of around $41,000 are rolling in it, and the lower end threshold of $23,400 above which the allowance will be gradually reduced also seems particularly mean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The notion of independence adopted by this bill is another I find difficult to understand. The minister says the application of the means test for the youth allowance reinforces the government's message that the family should support their young family members until they have achieved financial independence. What is this, and when does one achieve it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that the government changes its definition of financial independence in different policy areas to suit its revenue needs, and inconsistent signals are being sent out. For example, under the current Austudy provision a student is not considered independent until they turn 25 or satisfy other criteria, but for the purpose of the family tax initiative and child support, children are considered dependent only up until 18. Even under the proposed youth allowance, unemployed people will be considered independent if they are over 21 but not, it would appear, if they are students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is happening when the perception of many in the wider community remains that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10738"> people become adults when they turn 18; that they are independent at 18 because they are old enough to vote, marry, join the army, go to gaol&mdash;you name it. How can the government on the one hand be implementing policy telling parents their children are not independent until 25, but on the other hand maintaining the age of independence at 18?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we take the child support case, if a child turning 18 goes on to study, the non&hyphen;custodial parent who was forced by law to support them until 18 is no longer legally obliged to support them. This bill relies on some sort of moral obligation. The fact is that many parents who can afford to, do not share the government's moral view that they are obliged to support their grown&hyphen;up children and, as much as we want to force it, it is not going to happen. I think there is a real and genuine issue that deserves to be debated: when does a young person cease to be dependent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be interested perhaps to see some sort of survey taken to get an idea of the community feeling on the issue. I know many parents feel their children are adults and can fend for themselves when they turn 18. I am very concerned for those in the 16 to 18 age group who may find themselves in this situation and cannot get money from their parents, but at the same time cannot really prove they are homeless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would be very ignorant to pretend that there are not cases such as these. Exactly how these young people will support themselves in the future is worrying. Dare I say it will be through theft and teenage prostitution? It may only be a very small minority but it is a significant one. I don't know that the youth allowance addresses this. I certainly hope it will not come to that but if they cannot get the money from their parents they will have to get it somewhere&mdash;we can only guess where.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern I have is how the new allowance and its actual means test will be comprehended by applicants and their families, given the problems I have personally seen with Austudy. The test has dumbfounded many accountants, let alone parents and kids from lower socio&hyphen;economic groups and lower education backgrounds.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I hope the government's promised reforms to the Austudy AMT iron out the ludicrous anomalies, inconsistencies and complexities which have plagued its operation so far, I remain sceptical about whether this test can work in the youth allowance context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental inequity is that the bill is premised on the caring, sharing, utopian, white picket fence families so idealised by some members in this chamber. The bill ignores that many young people&mdash;if not the majority&mdash;whom this bill will adversely affect, do not come from such model families. They come from disjointed, struggling, less than ideal families. I am sure members of this House have also been faced by the Austudy applicant under the age of 25 whose parents simply refuse to support them. There is simply nothing that can be done for them. The hardship provisions do not seem to be able to deal with such cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do we deal with 16&hyphen; or 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds needing intensive support for whom school is an irrelevance? In evidence to the Senate committee on this bill, the Brotherhood of St Laurence called for special case management where some 16&hyphen; to 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds receive this allowance through agreeing to pursue forms of suitable activities rather than full&hyphen;time study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud such an approach. As a former teacher in the dim distant past of so-called general activities kids in junior high school, I can relate to those very kids and those very needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I firmly believe we are tackling this problem from the wrong end. The unemployed young are suffering from the consequences of economic change&mdash;technological and rationalist. The lack of job generation is our problem and not theirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until we introduce the social factor back into our economic policy and planning, where employment is an economic obligation and not purely a cost, all the independence criteria, youth allowances, work for the dole places or traineeships will not really be worth a cracker unless there is something permanent at the end of the line. The government claims these measures will encourage families to support young people until they are financial 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10739"> ly independent, but we need jobs for financial independence, and that is the missing part of the equation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inasmuch as the youth allowance attacks one end of the equation&mdash;encouraging greater schooling or training&mdash;and inasmuch as it significantly assists rural students, especially those studying away from home, I give my very guarded support to this bill. But I look forward to amendments that I believe inevitably will be introduced in the Senate, and I will be studying them with great interest. I support the second reading amendment that has been moved by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham).</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add my support to the common youth allowance bill of 1997. There is no doubt that young people do draw strength and support, as well as a boost to their morale, if there exists a healthy relationship with their parents, as a recent article quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> . The article by Anne Henderson, which appeared on 1 October, said that there is increasing evidence that young people may effectively be forced into a close relationship with their families because they cannot afford to leave home. Nobody mentions that there are families who expect and want to look after their own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has introduced the common youth allowance to simplify income support for young people and to help them to make the right decisions about their future. Further, it removes the disincentives which stop young people from continuing their education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been well documented&mdash;and it is a cause of constant complaint in my electorate of Gilmore&mdash;that young people on unemployment benefits were treated differently to young people who received subsidies whilst they were studying. I am constantly being asked by my electorate to justify, and be accountable for, the funding allocated to social security income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, I believe we must ask ourselves: how long can we as a government further promote the attitude of the previous government that it is okay for people not to contribute to society and that we believe you are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> much more valuable to us unemployed than you are with a job? That is the message we are sending by paying more for those who are unemployed than for those who want to improve their skills and become employable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also well known and a much publicised fact that only 30 per cent of our school leavers go on to tertiary education in one form or another. We know that the other 70 per cent are often ignored by the system, which classes university education as the only way to get a career. Therefore, it is important that we as a government recognise this and provide the extra finance to families to encourage our young people to continue further education or training or whilst they are actively looking for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is done by the introduction of the common youth allowance. The allowance puts together the best possible income support measure for young people and the community as a whole. Before that, we received submissions from welfare groups, community organisations, youth groups and parents, who were all consulted. They confirmed that the young people who drop out of school at the end of year 10 and who are unable to get a job are three times as likely to remain on the long-term unemployed list as those who continue in further education or training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recently released report on youth employment by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth employment: a working solution</EMPHASIS>, quotes a submission by DEETYA. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In May 1996 the unemployment rate for young people 20 to 24 years who did not complete the highest level of schooling was 21.3% compared with 11.5% for those who completed year 12.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report also notes that there is indisputable correlation between an individual's level of education and his or her social wellbeing and economic security. A well educated population is also a more adaptable and more socially productive population within a more efficient economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians want to see young people encouraged to work. They are tired of the message we are sending, that it is okay not to want to work and not to want to improve your 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10740"> skills. There are whole families&mdash;three or four generations in some cases&mdash;whose only source of income is welfare benefits. This has not just happened. We inherited it from the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians have also said that they are now tired of paying for people who can support themselves. A recently released Clemenger report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The silent majority</EMPHASIS> indicated that one of the two top concerns of Australians in the 1990s is alleged dole bludgers. Twenty years ago the two concerns were the length of power cords on domestic electrical equipment and the short lifespan of library books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an effort to assist young people to tackle not only disincentives to continue education and training but also the stigma and difficulties associated with receiving social security benefits, the government has introduced a streamline system of payments known as the common youth allowance. It will replace five different payments and 13 levels of payments with one form and one office to deal with. That is something which certainly has been welcomed by both young people and their parents in the two public forums that we have held in Gilmore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth workers have also welcomed the streamlining and simplification of income support for young people, while still being concerned about those young people who may slip through the system. Those  young people in that last group are already slipping through the system. Again, whole families have not been able to get the assistance they need over the past decade. We acknowledge that there will be some people who, for whatever reason, cannot find work or an appropriate training place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is still a need for a form of social security income support to guard against the reduction in the qualities of self&hyphen;dependence and self&hyphen;respect, which Australians are so ferociously proud of. That is why we have introduced, along with the common youth allowance, a range of exemptions which will give young people the flexibility to still receive income support. These exemptions include illness, homelessness, independence and the lack of a suitable employment or training place. These exemptions protect those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who need it the most. The safety net is still in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we must also recognise the real fear that many youth workers have pointed out in the forums I have attended in both Nowra and Ulladulla that, whilst the common youth allowance recognises that parents have a responsibility to care for their children, where they are able to do so rather than the taxpayer, it is not always possible to do that. There are too many young people, even in Gilmore, for whom home is not the place where they find the support they need; many young people are forced to live independently from an early age and therefore we have those exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that must be pointed out is that, while we are looking to be accountable for our social security system, the common youth allowance is not a cost cutting measure. In fact, it will cost the government an extra $25 million in the first year alone and it will provide a fairer, simpler system of income support for young people. Under some of the other measures which will be introduced as part of the common youth allowance, the education leavers scheme will be abolished, which means young people who leave school without a job and are eligible for the allowance will no longer have to wait up to 13 weeks before they can receive benefits. This move was given strong support at the recent Nowra forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rent assistance will be given to young people who need to live away from home for study or employment so they can follow their career dreams, which they may not have been able to do before because of financial hardship; and in my electorate, of course, the lack of everyday transport is a very common problem. This initiative alone will benefit about 70,000 young people throughout Australia, particularly those in regional and rural areas like Gilmore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The common youth allowance also increases the amount of funding available to families with unemployed children&mdash;these facts are readily available, certainly to the families in my electorate, where the scaremongering has already occurred. The bottom line is that, without further skills or education training, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10741"> young people will find it much harder to find work, and with disincentives in place to stop young people from gaining those skills and tuition there is little likelihood of change in the circumstances of these young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the former government to sit over there and continue to fight an issue which will provide support for those who need it, protect those who cannot help themselves and encourage a more productive, more highly educated young population which is motivated to helping its own is indicative of its attitude towards the residents of this country over the past 13 years. The community will no longer accept it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that youth unemployment is still the No. 1 issue facing not only our young people but also society as a whole. Recent statistics released by the Department of Social Security show that the youth unemployment rate dropped by 0.4 per cent last month, which is good news. But try telling that to the 26 per cent of young Australians who are still without work! The statistics are frightening and an indictment of how we, as a whole community, and our governments have failed our young people. The statistics also have a face. They are our children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, relatives and friends. For the first time in several generations, this is not something which just happens to someone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many families in the Gilmore electorate are affected by youth unemployment, as are many families throughout Australia. These families are supporting a young person, if not necessarily financially, certainly emotionally, for the cost of unemployment is not only in monetary terms. Young people who do not have a job lose a major way of networking in the community. They lose access to the normal interactions of a society which spends at least 40 hours per week&mdash;and, in many cases, more&mdash;in not only work situations but also social environments which have their own sense of rules and regulations and their own hierarchies. These are the places where young people can continue the learning process, developing their own identities in the way of the world.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a society which places more than a monetary value on having a job, young unemployed people are the big losers in terms of low self&hyphen;esteem, few social skills and little self&hyphen;respect. While the doom&hyphen;and&hyphen;gloom picture must be acknowledged, I feel it is more important to address the ways in which we, as a community and as a government, can improve young people's visions of their employment opportunities and therefore their future. We are doing this through the introduction of the common youth allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the main issues I would like to see considered is the way in which the whole community&mdash;particularly the opposition sitting on the other side of the chamber, who are responsible for the 30&hyphen;plus per cent youth unemployment rate which hit our young people as a result of the past 13 years of their ignorance and neglect&mdash;talks down the role of assisting young people, whether through negative stereotyping or maybe simply telling young people, `No, there is no hope for you; there are no jobs out there.' And all of us hear this every day. Yet most young people still have a very positive attitude to finding employment. I believe that the common youth allowance gives all young Australians a chance to decide where they want to go and what they want to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to point out another issue which will have a big impact on Australian  communities. Already in my electorate of Gilmore, local people have taken the initiative to host public forums to discuss the impact that these changes will have when they are introduced in July next year. Several issues were raised and I have outlined them previously. However, these were not the only areas of concern in Gilmore and I would like to highlight some of the main ones for you: the level of income cut&hyphen;off points for the parental means test and the age of children that is considered in the parental means test. I have already brought these issues to the attention of the minister. I thank the youth centres in both Nowra and Ulladulla for their initiative in organising these meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also proud to say that in Gilmore we did not wait for the government to assist the community to tackle issues of unemployment. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10742"> The recently announced work for the dole pilot program&mdash;two of which were granted in Gilmore to give more than 270 people placements throughout the Shoalhaven&mdash;was very well received by the whole community. It needs to be remembered that it was Labor who originally voted against the work for the dole program. They are now complaining that they have not received any programs. The most impressive point is that in Gilmore we already have our own work for the dole program through the Shoalhaven Earning a Living projects, which were established through the Shoalhaven Area Consultative Committee and were used as a model for the work for the dole program. I am proud that the Gilmore communities are willing to work in partnership with the government to take ownership of the problem of youth unemployment and I welcome the announcement of the Gilmore work for the dole programs as a recognition of the great work being done in the Shoalhaven.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The common youth allowance is supported by members of the Gilmore community as an example of the way we are assisting young people to break the cycle of youth unemployment by removing disincentives to further education, by simplifying the means of income support for young people and by making the social security system more accountable. Once the opposition see the assistance this will give to young people to become more interactive members of the Australian community, I am sure they will also do the right thing and support the legislation as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the role of this government does not stop there. We have allocated an extra 220,000 places for trainees and apprentices throughout Australia. In the Illawarra area alone, we have received an extra 2,800 places at a cost of $7 million over and above the national allocation to cater for those young people who may not wish to continue on at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In what little time I have left, I would like to comment on the success of our recently commenced Green Corps program at our national icon and tourist attraction known as Bundanon in Nowra. Nine young men and one young woman are taking part in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> program. These 10 young people are so proud of what they have achieved so far. They have displayed ownership not only of the work they have done but also of the problems of environmental degradation. The fact that they volunteered and were accepted for the program was a huge boost for their own self&hyphen;esteem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our work for the dole scheme will be a similar success. As I said, two programs have been allocated to Gilmore. They will see 270 young people in a program where the onus will be on our youth to exhibit, exceed and excel in the numerous talents they possess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud indeed of the young people in my electorate of Gilmore. I will do all I can to see that jobs are produced for the many people who really do want to work. The common youth allowance will go hand&hyphen;in&hyphen;hand with our employment programs to give our young people a real choice and to give the community a real chance to change its attitude about our young people and the present social security system.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before commenting on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill before the House today, I would like to remind the honourable member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) that, while we welcome the right of employment for young people, I think it is very discriminatory that only certain young people in her community have the right to work. What about the rest of them? That is what I believe is so wrong about work for the dole. I think a piece of legislation which would even contemplate giving the right to work to just a few rather than to all is an obscene piece of legislation. If we are going to have payments go out like that, let us make sure that everyone is covered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Meanwhile, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) said just five months ago in this House that the youth allowance was designed to send a `clear message' to young Australians that they should remain in school or at some other training institution as opposed to looking for work and relying on some level of income support in that process. However, only 18 months ago, in direct contradiction of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10743"> that, the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, in what can now be described as one of his non&hyphen;eventful headland speeches:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's not an acceptable response to the youth unemployment crisis to tell young people to stay at school.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So we are provided with a glimpse of the utter confusion and hypocrisy that characterises the Howard government on the issues of youth unemployment and making sure that the youth of Australia and their families have an adequate social security safety net to meet their needs. The youth allowance is borne of that confusion and hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does contain some positive and useful elements. The increased rates of payment for some young people is one of those and the increased flexibility of payments is another. I also acknowledge that one of the government's stated intentions in introducing this bill is to reduce the complexity of the arrangements which surround income support for young people. I commend that. However, abolishing income support for 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who are neither studying nor at work and applying a parental means test to the payments of those aged between 18 and 20 undoes that good work. It is going to make life very difficult for thousands of struggling young people and their families across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against the government's stated objectives, nor does this bill reduce the complexity surrounding income support for young people. Indeed, in some areas it actually adds to the confusion. Unfortunately the negative aspects in this bill far outnumber the positives. It is these negative elements which are going to cause so much pain to so many Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the opposition want Australian young people off welfare, but, unlike the government, we can see that punishing them and their families by cutting off or reducing their level of income support while they look for a job is not the way to go about it. I advise even government members to read the Senate minority report prepared by Labor and the Australian Democrats on this legislation. It makes it clear that the young Australians to whom this bill denies help are precisely the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> young Australians who most need our assistance. When young Australians who are in desperate straits need help in finding work, the last thing we in this parliament should be doing is making things more difficult for them. This bill does exactly that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At least 30,000 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds will lose all income support from this piece of legislation. Thousands of 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds will have their benefits reduced the moment their family's income exceeds $23,400. For some, that will not be a problem. They will have families who are financially comfortable enough and emotionally stable enough to offer their young people their support. However, for a great many others this will be a source of unremitting friction and antagonism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many Australian families not only do not live financially comfortable lives; they also experience a great many social and emotional problems. Those problems either lead 16&hyphen; to 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds to want to leave home and not rely on their parents' support or indeed lead parents to want to not offer their support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the youth allowance was first raised, the editorial from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> quite rightly pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a fact of life that some parents reject their offspring&mdash;materially and emotionally&mdash;and vice versa. Under the changed scheme, the consequences of such conflict will have to be so drastic as to make a youngster homeless before help is available. And families are simply required to endure within the home all the stages of anguish which build to that point.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The new rules governing the youth allowance do not take these sorts of families into account. On the contrary, they will go a long way to fostering the antagonism that is unfortunately already there, setting many families on the road to irretrievable breakdown and even placing some of our young people in danger of physical and mental assault at the hands of their parents, and vice versa. It happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his colleagues sitting on the government benches must be living in a fool's paradise if they think that saying, `It's time we threw the responsibility of supporting young out&hyphen;of&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10744"> work&hyphen;people back on their parents,' is really going to be as simple and clear cut as all that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As our shadow minister for education and youth affairs pointed out in his speech on the second reading debate, the Howard government, as typified by this bill, does not appreciate the diversity that exists in Australian families. This legislation makes the presumption that the arrangements contained in the youth allowance will be acceptable to all Australian families and that all Australian families have the same welfare needs when quite obviously they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has shown once again just how limited and how blinkered its vision is when it comes to understanding the needs and concerns of Australia and Australians in the 1990s. Were it a case that every Australian family offered the financial and emotional support to pick up the slack when their 16&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;old child either has their income support reduced or completely cut off and were it a case that they could support these children while they returned to school or to some other training institution, there would not be a problem, but of course&mdash;as I have repeatedly said&mdash;not all Australian families are in this position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The professionals whose job it is to care for dysfunctional families and whose job it is to pick up the pieces when these families disintegrate know it is not as simple as the Howard government has fooled itself into believing it to be. The Australian Council of Social Services has stated that the new arrangements will just exacerbate family conflict. The Brotherhood of St Laurence has said that many families will now face added pressures. The Anglican Home Mission's executive director, Howard Dillon, has stated that taking income support away from 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds would put `substantial financial, emotional and relational pressure on families who are already doing it tough'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Anne Hollands, the director of services at Relationships Australia, a counselling and advice service used most recently by the federal government as an integral part of its marriage guidance strategy for Australian couples, states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no question this will create difficulties in some families. In families where relationships are extremely difficult and the young person needs to get out, it will be much harder for the person to establish themselves independently.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Apart from the emotional and relationship problems these measures will cause, taking money away from families which are often already facing financial hardship is cruel and obviously ill&hyphen;conceived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A family on a combined income of $23,000 is not by any stretch of the imagination privileged or living on easy street, nor indeed is one on $33,000. The income support which a 16&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;old living in such a household brings in is sometimes an essential part of keeping that family afloat. It is not money that is spent on luxuries or indulgences. It is money that is spent on food, rent, paying bills and clothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By introducing the means test at such a low level many families in my electorate, and in others like it across Australia, are going to find their backs pressed even harder against the wall. That is really where this legislation is going to do the real damage. It is not going to damage the comfortable areas of Sydney's North Shore or the eastern suburbs, nor in the bou tique environs of Toorak Road in Melbourne, but in western Sydney and areas like western Sydney. The housing commission estates of Villawood and Fairfield in my electorate is where this is really going to hurt. They are the families that will be affected by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The perimeters of the means test also raises questions about the government's view of when a young person is actually considered independent. Young people start to become civilly and criminally responsible after they reach the age of 16 and most definitely from 18 years onwards. They are actually given the vote in this country at 18. However, this legislation penalises those aged between 18 and 20 by regarding them as dependent on their parents. Young adults who are looking for work are independent and this legislation needs to be changed to recognise this fact. They should not be forced by the imposition of a means test to rely on their families for support, especially if their family subsists on a low income.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10745">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The high hypocrisy of it all is that, while the Howard government preaches extra education and training as a way out of youth unemployment, it has done all it can to reduce funding and the number of student places in institutions offering vocational education and training. The hypocrisy of it all is that in my electorate alone the Howard government is willing to keep over 500 extra young people in school, or force them back into education, but it will do nothing to provide a single drop of extra funding to cope with this influx.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telling Australians that they have to do more with less has become a demand synonymous with this government, but this is something which the families and schools in my area will not be able to endure. Making up stories about training places and apprenticeships has also become something of a hallmark of this administration. I am sorry to say that, but it is a fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Kemp&mdash;and as we all know the title stems from his talent at doctoring the figures he uses in this House&mdash;says that under this government we will see 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships, when in actual fact this year we will see at most only an extra 3,000 across Australia. Growth in government apprenticeships has also declined under the present administration. It has been cut by two&hyphen;thirds.Then the minister talks about the $4 billion extra which the Howard government earmarked for TAFE in the last budget&mdash;$4 billion extra? This is a complete fabrication. That $4 billion is not extra money at all; it was money that had already been allocated by Labor when in government. The only thing the minister has done is cut the figure originally decided upon by $72 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Howard government is going to abrogate its responsibilities in providing an adequate social security safety net for Australia's young people and if it is going to force them to stay at school against their wishes&mdash;because, let us face it, no matter how much some kids are cajoled into it, there will always be a few who do not want to stay at school&mdash;then it must provide the additional educational resources. Here again, we are provided with an insight into this government's limited capacity for appreciating the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> diverse problems and needs of Australian young people and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation displays a government which completely fails to understand why some young people give up on education prematurely and why some young people are unable to remain in education until matriculation. Young people do not leave school because they have better things to do. Young people do not just leave school because they want to receive unemployment benefits for the fun of it. More than likely, if a young Australian is leaving school prematurely it is because he or she has severe emotional problems, could be a victim of sexual abuse or violence, could be involved in drugs at school, suffers from alienation and depression, or has serious learning difficulties. All reports point to these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer again to comments made by the Brotherhood of St Laurence about young Australians:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They flee the school system because for them school has for some years been an experience with which they are not coping. More young people flee the school system because . . . they feel they do not belong there and because they feel they are not wanted there, then they flee the school system seeking income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Forcing young people to stay at school in order to get an income . . . is a dubious, incomplete and probably counterproductive approach to the problems of youth unemployment and early school leaving.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet this government simplistically and naively says to these young people, `Get off income support and get back to school. We are going to wash our hands of you and your family.' Where is the sense in that? Where is the understanding of what many of these young people are going through? Forcing children with learning difficulties and social problems back to the environment from which they long to escape is a recipe for disaster. It is a recipe for compounding their problems and the problems of their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Worse than being a simplistic or naive move, it is an action that smacks of a government almost falling over its own feet to divest itself of any responsibility it may have towards these young Australians or their families. Why is the government not contemplat 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10746"> ing an alternative approach&mdash;an alternative to letting these young people remain on income support or simply shoehorning them back to school? These young people would stand a greater chance of finding work and removing themselves from the welfare line if they were to be offered intensive case management. What about early intervention policies, which would help ascertain why these children want to leave school in the first place, find out what problems they have which are an impediment to their education and then set about solving them? Either the government is so lacking in imagination and intelligence that it has completely failed to canvass these options or it has rejected them in the process of shrugging off any responsibilities it has to these young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no good telling us, as we have heard time and time again from speakers on the government side, that these young people may be exempt from having their income support taken away or reduced in certain circumstances. As the Senate minority report makes very clear:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no provision in the bill for the making of guidelines to inform the Secretary's decision about this exemption. On the basis of evidence presented to us, we are not confident that the exemptions will be sufficiently flexible to allow for payment in the full range and diversity of circumstances which might lead a young person to leave education without finishing year 12.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To back up its rhetoric and to provide a little equilibrium to this hopelessly unbalanced legislation, the Howard government must provide immediate extra funding to cope with the influx of 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who will be forced back to school because of the youth allowance&mdash;especially in electorates like mine, which will bear the brunt of the 20,000 students who will remain in or return to education if these measures are introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government must reinstate and expand the highly successful students at risk program, which was specifically designed to identify and to assist young people at risk of leaving school early. It must guarantee the jobs pathway program beyond the current financial year. It must resume the pattern of growth funding for TAFE, established by Labor when in office. It must also restore the earnings 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> credit scheme, which it abolished soon after taking office in 1996. Without doing these things the Howard government, more than just being seen as short&hyphen;sighted in instituting the youth allowance in the first place, will then correctly be seen as two&hyphen;faced and extremely cold&hyphen;hearted. It will be seen, Pontius Pilate&hyphen;like, washing its hands of the responsibilities which it carries, unquestionably, in relation to the welfare of thousands of young Australians and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I condemn this bill in its present form. We are not talking about the one or two cases that are often reported to the electoral offices; we are talking about the young across the length and breadth of this country. Those people need help at the moment when their emotional lives are on the drawing board; they do not need it later on. This is when a government should act and this is when a government should intervene to assist and help, otherwise where do we give regard to what we proudly consider to be the future of this country? I condemn the bill in its present form.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard some fantastic rhetoric from the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) before but nothing quite to match that speech. The member finished off by saying she condemns the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill, but the opposition has indicated that it is going to support the bill. I am not quite sure whether that means you are going to vote differently to what the opposition has indicated an intention to do or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition have moved an amendment but, again, it is a pious amendment because it does not give us any indication of what sorts of practical solutions the Labor Party might have to some of the problems that have just been enunciated in such terms by the member for Prospect. They indicate that they will support the bill in the House but they condemn the government for doing some things, and I will address those issues in a moment. They do not have the courage of their convictions by seeking to amend this bill in a constructive way, indicating what alternatives they might bring in. They simply want 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10747"> to condemn the government for doing certain things, calling the government to do other nebulous or broad things without defining them, such as introducing education and training opportunities so that every young Australian has access to the education and skills needed for full participation in the workplace and society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do those words mean? That sort of amendment means nothing. I would challenge the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), if he wants to play a constructive role in this very important debate&mdash;and we all acknowledge the importance of talking about jobs for young people and educational opportunities for young people&mdash;to come back into this place and move some substantive amendments to the legislation that actually give us an indication of what the Labor Party might do if it were ever to have the opportunity to do something as a government of this country again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is&mdash;and I do not want to harp on it too much&mdash;that we had 13 years of Labor government and in that 13 years they had lots of opportunities to fix up the problems. In the event, as we saw, all they did was create problems and then attempt to solve those problems by introducing all sorts of programs, the results of which proved to be a great deception. Many people were misled by the former government's attempts to create jobs and educational opportunities because that did not happen. Over 13 years of Labor government we simply had the situation going from bad to worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I do not take the rhetoric of the member for Prospect seriously. I do not doubt her good intentions, but I do not take seriously her criticisms of this bill. The plain fact is that this bill is not a savings measure. That ultimately gives the lie to any serious criticism of this bill. It is not a savings measure. It might well be a savings measure because we have been forced as a government to embark on a process of making substantial savings, essentially because we were left, as we frequently remind the opposition is this place, with a job to do to get the country's finances into shape. It is just as well we did. When we look at what is occurring around us 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in Asia and other places we need to give the Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the government as a whole a very big tick and pat on the back for having taken the hard decisions that it has had to take. If those decisions had not been taken, then we might well have had the International Monetary Fund knocking on our door as well. We have had to take a lot of hard decisions and each of us on this side of the House knows that in government when you take hard decisions they are inevitably unpopular and impact on some group of people who are obviously unhappy about the decision having been taken. I have often said that it is much harder being in government than being in opposition. My first six years in this place were in opposition and it was very easy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the member for Wills, at the table, recognises the problem. When you are in government you have to take hard decisions. The temptation is to do what is popular but not necessarily what is right. This government, to its credit, has taken many of the right decisions even though in the short term they may not be seen to be entirely popular. The opposition has a valuable role to play. There is no doubt about that. Having been in opposition for six years prior to coming to government, I began to understand more clearly that the opposition does in our system have a valuable role to play and it needs to be a constructive role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not seen from this opposition, and it is demonstrated in their contribution so far to this debate, a constructive criticism or approach to being in opposition. We have seen a populist approach; an approach that jumps on any bandwagon that happens to come by that might have a few voters in it in an attempt to gather support. Whether or not that is in Australia's best interests or not is not an issue for the opposition. The only issue in their response to most of our policies has been whether there might be a few votes in it for them if they oppose it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not entirely dismiss the speech of the member for Prospect other than I think she protesteth a little too much and overstates her 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10748"> opposition rather than recognising that the Labor Party is supporting this legislation because it is essentially good legislation. The amendment the opposition has moved is not a serious amendment because it does not attempt to make any substantive changes to the legislation. It is what is called a `pious amendment'. The opposition might be able to run around outside and tell people who do not understand how this place works that it tried to amend the legislation, but it was not serious about it because it has not made a proper attempt to do that. We may well see some serious attempt to amend the legislation in substantive terms in the Senate, but that remains to be seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance is not a savings measure. It will cost the government an extra $25 million in its first year of operation. In the current economic context, I can tell you, having been very much on the receiving end of the process in a lot of respects in my electorate, there are not many ministers' departments where the government has had the luxury of actually spending more. We have, as I said at the outset, been faced with the very difficult task, which has been achieved to a very great extent, of trying to get the government's finances back into line from where they were when we came into government. The extra $25 million means that, of the 560,000 recipients of youth allowance, 64 per cent will be unaffected by the changes, 27.5 per cent will actually get more money, six per cent only will get less money and only 2.5 per cent will have their payments cancelled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very easy for the opposition to do as the member for Prospect did and concentrate on the six per cent who will get less money and the 2.5 per cent who will have their payments cancelled. But our assessment of the situation is that those people were not in the broad scheme of things entitled to continue to have a payment because of the means tests that were being applied or, because of those means tests, were entitled to less money. Fundamentally we believe that welfare should go to those who are most in need. Inevitably, if you start with that principle, which I think is broadly supported, you will need to draw 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lines. Wherever you draw a line in this sort of argument, you will find some people who are on what they see as the wrong side of the line and they will therefore have something to argue about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me deal specifically with some of the matters that were raised by the member for Prospect and make clear that, firstly, youth allowance will not&mdash;and I emphasise not&mdash;abolish the dole for 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. That is just not the case. Young people who finish year 12 are much more likely to get a job, and therefore it is important to encourage young people to get an education. That is why youth allowance will only be paid to under&hyphen;18s who are studying or training. Families will be financially better off, too, because parents will still be able to claim the family tax initiative. The other issue that was raised was in relation to 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. We just do not accept that the youth allowance will treat 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds unfairly, nor do we accept that it penalises low income families, for a number of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not been able to follow the whole debate, but what I have seen so far from the Labor Party is to a very large extent another example of its back to the future approach to solving our nation's problems. Except, I must say, for the shadow minister who is at the table, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), there is not much evidence of new Labor in the policy prescriptions we are hearing from the Labor Party. It is the old Labor Party that is still in control, and consequently we see those old prescriptions. We had 13 years of those old prescriptions and clearly they just did not work. You would have thought that in some of the speeches by opposition members there would at least be a tinge of contrition for the fact that they brought about, on balance, a great deal of angst and a great deal of disappointment for young people who were promised jobs and outcomes which we now know were not delivered. But, as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) pointed out yesterday in question time, the socialist dream lives on. It is still written into the Labor Party manifesto, and that is what is being acknowledged there.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10749">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen as a result of 13 years of Labor government is the creation of a welfare dependency in our society which is endemic. They still believe on that side of the House that the government should solve every problem. The damage to the fabric of our society that has been caused by that is immeasurable. I heard the member for Forde (Mrs Elson) on our side speaking earlier on, and she outlined in very eloquent terms how that had caused so much damage to our society. The Labor Party clearly is good at spending other people's money. They still believe that they can actually solve all of our problems with the sort of interventionist solutions that they have inflicted upon us in the past. But I think there is a growing realisation in the Australian community that there is no such thing as a free lunch for us as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the speakers in the debate that I did listen to earlier I think made a very good contribution by recognising the realities that we are faced with as a  nation. There is a huge unemployment problem, and it is an unemployment problem which has become very difficult to solve. I think there is a need for us as a nation in a bipartisan sense or a multi&hyphen;partisan sense to really come to grips with the extent of the problem and not merely use these debates as an opportunity for an ideological slanging match. There were some contributions that were intended to actually recognise the reality of the situation. But the fact is that there are not enough jobs to go around, and the facts are clear: the better educated are more likely to get the jobs that are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an underlying principle of this particular legislation, because it provides the incentives&mdash;and I use the word `incentives' in the sense that it provides the motivation&mdash;for individuals to gain education and training opportunities rather than taking what was in the past, whether we like it or not, an easier option, which was simply to go on the dole and sit back and navel gaze about what was happening in the world. So the incentives that we are talking about are the sorts of incentives&mdash;not the sort of incentives that I heard the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> talking about; when people on the other side talk about incentives, they are talking about handouts and programs and things that do not lead anywhere&mdash;that essentially will provide people with the motivation to undertake training opportunities, because the better trained and the better educated will have the jobs that are available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bigger problem of job creation is a matter of concern to all of us. If we are honest and realistic about it, I think we all realise that that is going to become more and more difficult to do. In fact, the forecasts that we see indicate that there will be less and less people doing the available work. Even now, there are many companies in Australia that admit that they are overemploying, for a whole range of reasons. What we do need to face up to as a nation is the real challenge of redefining work and looking closely at what will provide fulfilment for people. Until now, work has clearly been a major factor in providing that fulfilment. That is why long&hyphen;term unemployment in particular is so demeaning to so many people. So we need as a society and as a parliament to think more about what the alternatives to paid work might be, and we need to ensure that people have the opportunity to be fulfilled in a situation which we will inevitably face where there are less and less jobs available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, the youth allowance is positive and good news, and it is disingenuous of members opposite to attempt to cloud the issues by talking about a whole range of other things which are not relevant. Youth allowance is about providing consistency, efficiency and flexibility. It is important, I believe, that young people are not better off on the dole than in education or training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was occurring before was wrong in that there was a disincentive for people to continue in education and training. We might argue about the training or the education they were receiving&mdash;and there are some problems, as have been mentioned, with people staying at school perhaps when they do not need to; and there is the fact that I still think senior high school is, in some respects, not appropriate to the needs of young people who are staying on. But the fact is that previously the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10750"> wrong message was being sent out to young people&mdash;that they were better off on the dole than attempting to undertake training or education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular legislation addresses that issue because it makes it at least equally attractive and, in many respects, more financially attractive for young people to remain in education and training. Students now will have the opportunity, by virtue of this legislation, to access benefits to which they were not entitled before&mdash;and those things include rent assistance, pharmaceutical allowance, $500 interest&hyphen;free advances, and so on. So this legislation does contain some major incentives for young people to remain in training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some criticism of the parental means test. I think that criticism is understandable up to a point&mdash;in particular, that parents should maintain some responsibility for full&hyphen;time students up to their 25th birthday. Once again, this is a matter of where you draw the line in these issues. You can argue, as did the member for Prospect, that young people can get drivers licences when they are 17, they can vote when they are 18, and I suppose they can go to war when they are 18. But in the end, in dealing with this matter, I think there has to be an understanding that parents in a lot of cases want to assist&mdash;and understand that they do have some responsibility for assisting&mdash;young people until they can become financially independent. Therefore, the line is drawn at that particular point in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the means test is concerned, there was criticism of the previous Austudy actual means test. It was complex, but essentially it was right. I do not know that there was much argument from the other side about that, other than with the complexity and the way it was brought in. But it was right, because it attempted to get to the bottom of many of the so-called rorts that were occurring with benefits where people were managing to contrive their income situation, particularly where they were self-employed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, my time has almost expired. Therefore, let me say to you and to the House that this legislation is overwhelmingly positive. I commend it to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill</XREF>  and to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I do so more in sorrow than in anger because it really, I believe, is a sad reflection on the Howard government's approach to the people of Australia that this legislation abolishes the unemployment benefits that would have been payable to 17- and 18-year-olds, and has assets tests inflicted on parents of children 18 years old and over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be easy to get very angry with such a mean&hyphen;spirited government. However, I think sorrow is the appropriate emotion to feel, as we observe the economic rationalist policies attacking the welfare of our young people and low income families within our community. I say `sorrow' again because the govern ment has, once again, got its social security policies wrong&mdash;just as it has got them wrong relating to child care, aged care and, of course, the increased costs that are being imposed on older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions of this legislation clearly implement the coalition government's economic rationalist philosophy that parents should support young people until they achieve financial independence. This is a great way to help battling families, I must say!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I just want to make this point in this debate: I would argue very strongly that 99 per cent of all school leavers want to work. I will never accept the argument that has been put by some people on the other side that, because we do have a safety net social security provision, somehow or other young people would prefer to receive social security than to work. That is not the case, and I believe that is where the government's legislation is wrong. I think, as was said by the previous speaker, the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), the major problem is that there are simply not enough jobs to go around&mdash;and I will address that issue a little later.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10751">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation continues the pattern that has permeated the whole government in its short history of winding back government's involvement rather than meeting the needs of a nation with high unemployment by active government intervention. The government has, in its short term, abolished labour market programs; increased fees for higher education; removed income support; and really hurt low income families. I believe that the government has misunderstood the nature of the problem. It is throwing the responsibility of overcoming youth unemployment entirely on our education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a decline in full&hyphen;time jobs by 50.2 per cent for 15&hyphen; to 16-year-olds over the past 15 years&mdash;no matter how many unemployed people are encouraged back into the school system, or how many potential school leavers are encouraged by this legislation to stay on in the education system&mdash;you will simply not find all the jobs necessary to reduce unemployment by any significant degree. In the main, I do not believe that high youth unemployment is caused by our young people's lack of education or training, or their lack of willingness to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The causes of high youth unemployment are set out in a recent report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth employment: a working solution</EMPHASIS>, which has been referred to by several members in this debate already. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes in the composition of the labour market have seen the most severe declines occurring in entry level jobs, once the domain of teenagers entering the labour market. Employment growth for teenagers in skilled trades has been strongly negative, falling more than 33 per cent in about ten years. Banking was once an industry which gave large numbers of teenagers their first job as a teller but technology has transformed the industry and the entry level jobs have disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the insurance industry, the proportion of employment for under 21 year olds has fallen from about 18 per cent of the work force to about 5 per cent since 1987. Technology and policies favouring privatisation, corporatisation and outsourcing have also transformed the state and federal public sectors at the cost of large numbers of entry level jobs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This report has been accepted by the government. The last sentence gives us a clear 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indication of where the major problem is. The issues highlighted in this quotation need to be addressed before we overcome youth unemployment. Let me talk a little more about the problem. We have a nation that daily confronts stagnant youth unemployment and parents are now facing the added burden of having their income and assets included in a means test as their children seek government assistance. Many of these parents are not high income people. They do not enjoy family trusts to avoid taxes, as do some 19 members of the government's front bench. Where this legislation does authorise the secretary to the department to grant exceptions, these are not subject to any scrutiny. Why is this so? The community might well ask this important question. They are entitled to be not only sceptical but also cynical in their view that the unscrutinised exemptions will not assist the low income families and their needy kids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is to force some 27,000 unemployed youth back to school. Has there been any examination by the government as to why these young people left school in the first place? This legislation shows a complete lack of understanding by the government of why people leave school prior to completing their higher school certificate. In most cases it is because they have lost interest in the school environment. This attitude comes about because of a range of issues such as change of school, emotional problems, difficulties at home and drug addiction. I fell into part of the above group as a young person when as a school student I moved to a new school. I did not settle into the new school and my academic performance deteriorated considerably. It was only when my father directed me into a railway apprenticeship that I again started to take an interest in my studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lesson to be learnt here is that once young people have prospects of employment their attitude, and particularly their attitude to study, improves. I believe the appropriate way to overcome youth unemployment is for the government to research the skill requirements of the future and then to fully finance four&hyphen;year apprenticeships in those skills in federal government departments, state government departments and appropriate private industry. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10752"> I again refer to the youth employment report quoted earlier. In relation to skill shortages, the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite this background of high unemployment and substantial structural change in the labour market, Australia continues to experience significant, and in some cases severe, skill shortages in some industries and occupations. Some submissions and presentations to the inquiry flagged prospective skill shortages in particular industries. The Committee sought further information from industry associations about current and prospective skill shortages but did not obtain many responses. What information is available, particularly on prospective shortages, does not cover a comprehensive range of occupational areas. It is a concern to the Committee that young people are not, in most cases, aware of the opportunities indicated by the available information.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report goes on to refer to some 4,000 unfilled jobs Australia wide in the hotel industry and the acute shortage of some 1,000 chefs Australia wide. The  report also found that there was a shortage of welders and other skills in rural areas of New South Wales, and some employers told of difficulties in filling apprenticeships and traineeships in some rural and remote areas. In the manufacturing industry, the MTIA has reported a wide range of skill shortages in occupations such as technicians, engineers, several trades and trades people with technical backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a constructive suggestion, what this government should be doing is matching these skill shortages with our school leavers and potential school leavers. I consider it soul destroying to force young people who have already made a decision to leave school back into the classroom. This move will cause enormous problems for the various education systems, with disruption in the classroom, and will require additional resources to educate the extra students. What this mean&hyphen;spirited government of bean counters seeks is a chance, by sleight of hand, to lower the unemployment figures by removing the income support for young people, forcing them back to school and then exclaiming, `Great. We have achieved our objective. A miracle has happened. Unemployment is down.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that the government seems to be working from DEETYA advice on some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sort of New South Wales data that appear to be flawed in three major areas. They have assumed that half of the current recipients, 15,000, will be exempt and therefore will not seek to re&hyphen;enter education and training. This would appear to be an overstatement. A better guesstimate, I am advised, would be closer to a quarter. The government has assumed that nine persons will return to the school system for every one to TAFE. Bearing in mind that many left school because of bad experiences, it must be highly questionable to now say that only 10 per cent would opt for TAFE. In fact, it is expected that up to some 65 per cent would rather go to TAFE than back to school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has assumed that, by the withdrawal of social security benefits and the availability of Austudy, this will be a strong incentive for people to go back to school. However, for 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds this is now means tested, and many are likely to lose any entitlements to Austudy. Accepting that 15,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 19 will be affected by the Commonwealth changes in New South Wales, and assuming that two&hyphen;thirds return to study&mdash;and one-third do nothing&mdash;and that 65 per cent of these returnees go to TAFE and 35 per cent go to school, some 6,435 would be returning to TAFE and some 3,466 would be returning to school. This is in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on full-time attendance costs, these figures would mean an extra cost of $51.48 million for TAFE and an extra cost of $24.26 million for schools&mdash;a total of $75.74 million. All of this is going to place a severe strain on the funding of both schools and TAFEs in New South Wales. While the federal government is claiming that the cost will be only $36 million and New South Wales is claiming that it will be $75.74 million, it is obvious that there is going to be an unfunded cost to New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this change and the expected outcomes that will flow from this legislation in an economic sense, it seems quite peculiar for the government to then expect states to pick up the tab for policies over which they have no say or input. Sixteen&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and 17-year-olds will be forced to stay at school or go back to school because they have no other 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10753"> income support options, and some will obviously be unruly and disruptive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that within my electorate of Greenway some 308 children will be forced back into the school system. While this in itself may not seem a large figure, I am sure that, if I went to all the principals in my electorate collectively and said to them, `You have to find places for another 308 children,' they would collapse with fear. As we know, schools are already overcrowded. To take that argument a bit further, it is not only the kids who are affected but also the families. If you add to those 308 children the mothers and fathers who are also affected by this extra pressure, you are looking at close to 1,000 people who are affected directly and indirectly by this legislation within my own electorate of Greenway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Receipt of income support should certainly be tied to a range of alternative activities&mdash;not just school education&mdash;which help young people to get work and reach their full potential. To abolish unemployment benefits while also slashing education opportunities is the wrong way to reform the welfare state. This is the negative approach of a government more concerned with winding back the role of government than creating new opportunities through the possibilities of education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young adults who are old enough to vote, to go to war, to get married&mdash;and many do the latter&mdash;and who are looking for work are clearly independent. They should not be forced by the imposition of a parental income, assets and actual means test to rely on their low income families for support. I believe young Australians who are looking for work should be encouraged to take up work opportunities by the restoration of the earnings credits scheme, mirroring the student income bank arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be noted that the government has failed to provide additional funding for sufficient relevant school and post&hyphen;school education. I emphasise that the ALP is determined to broaden the availability and range of opportunities in education and training, particularly for teenagers. The Howard government has quarantined some parts of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth budget from funding cuts, but it is appalling that it has made education and training the major part of its fiscal consolidation program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As stated earlier, with the introduction of this legislation called youth allowance&mdash;which is a misnomer; it should be called the youth non-allowance&mdash;an estimated 27,000 young people will be forced back to school next year. The impact of these new or ongoing enrolments will not be shared uniformly. They will be concentrated in areas of high unemployment, such as Prospect, Greenway, Chifley and other areas in western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the government to reinstate and expand the students at risk&mdash;STAR&mdash;program, which was specifically designed to identify and assist young people at risk of leaving school early. I urge the government to restore the specific equity programs for disadvantaged schools with a commitment of additional resources, specialised programs and Labor's initiative for a parents as educators program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that many young people need counselling support from qualified psychiatrists available in and through the school to address their family and emotional difficulties and to encourage them to stay at school. They need proper work oriented careers education when they are at school. They need expanded work experience opportunities while there. They also need expanded school to work transitional programs which create pathways for them to enter the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, for some unfathomable reason, gives some funding improvements for vocational education and training and then totally negates such actions by other government actions. It chops 117,000 places in labour market programs for young people and reduces case management for the young unemployed, adding chaos to the employment services market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to remember that early school leaving is also connected with homelessness amongst young people. Therefore, the level of resources for the job placement, employment and training program, which aims to help young people overcome problems preventing them from maintaining stable accommodation and entering into full-time 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10754"> education, training and employment, must be considered&mdash;I emphasise `must be considered'&mdash;as part of this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ongoing effects of this legislation will not only affect the 27,000 who are forced back to school; it will not only affect the many thousands of 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and over and their parents who will be forced to take on the financial responsibility that many cannot afford; the ongoing effects of this legislation will also affect the thousands of young people who would always have intended to stay at school. Their lives and classes will be disrupted by unwilling participants. This must, in the long run, lead to a lowering of our educational achievements among young people, and it is another criticism of this legislation and this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the parliament acknowledge that the learning needs of young Australians are exceptionally diverse. One of the challenges this government has is to cope with this diversity of our society, especially in the area of education and training. Clearly, one size no longer fits all the constructions of learning methods. But it is obvious from this legislation that the government simply has no idea and no care for young people. It adopts an ideological approach that says that all kids should be at school and, irrespective of the income of their parents, should stay at school and will not get any financial help from government in this time of massive unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation continues to put in place a sad, uncaring policy that only has consideration for economic rationalist views of balancing budgets and never ever having the well off contribute to assist the not so well off. Who could have believed that a government that promised so much to the voters and received so much goodwill in the ballot box could have descended so low, so quickly and so permanently?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to support a reform that is long overdue in our social welfare system: the enactment of a single income support payment for our young people. After listening to the speech of the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield), I, like previous government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> speakers who have risen today, wonder exactly where the opposition are coming from in terms of their amendments to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997</XREF> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the very things which they have argued this government is not doing are covered not only by this particular bill but also by other corresponding initiatives which this government has undertaken. That is the essence of it all. We on this side are looking at the solutions that our young kids are after&mdash;not in some form of compartmentalised nature, where one initiative in isolation from another will resolve the issues, but rather in the form of building on various initiatives which other ministers are also undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer specifically to the great initiatives that have been introduced by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Senator Ellison) through the jobs pathway program and the one&hyphen;stop shops that have been successfully created in my electorate. I will speak more about that a little later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, along with the member for Greenway, was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. He and I certainly had some very good times as we moved around Australia listening to young kids. I know that he shares&mdash;as I and other members of the committee did at the time&mdash;the despair and the frustration which our young kids have today about their future. This bill is at the heart of what the kids are after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The objectives of this bill are the simplification of the current system; increased flexibility for our young kids; and an investment in the future of these kids to provide them with the opportunity to invest in their future&mdash;something which is so highly demanded. It is interesting that the member for Greenway and I have reached different positions on this issue, even though we both listened to the same evidence, the same despair and the same frustration that took place&mdash;whether that was in metropolitan Australia or in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10755">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The common youth allowance recognises that young people's circumstances often change more rapidly than do the circumstances of people of my generation. They commence and finish study or training, they move in and out of work and, quite often, they juggle a combination of the two to get by. Sometimes they get sick and can neither work nor study. The bill we are debating today will provide for young people in all these circumstances, and it will make it easier for those who need financial support to receive it when  they are moving from one to another. More importantly, it will leave 137,000 young Australians&mdash;or almost one in four young people on income support&mdash;better off than they are now. I emphasise that: better off than they are now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have mentioned, the reasons for this reform are obvious: simplification, flexibility and investment. I want to expand on each one of those points in my contribution today. Firstly, on the surface we desperately need to simplify the complex web of payments available to young people and make it easier to get the support they need when their circumstances change. Under the current system, some payments have a qualifying or waiting period, while others take several weeks before the money starts to come through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the youth allowance, five payments&mdash;Austudy, youth training allowance, newstart allowance, sickness allowance and some forms of family payment&mdash;will be rolled into one. The current 13 rates of pay applicable to people in varying circumstances will be simplified to just five&mdash;13 down to five&mdash;without ignoring the needs of disadvantaged people. There will be no waiting periods for young people who get sick or get better and start or finish study, training or job seeking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Welfare organisations have lobbied hard for this simplification of the current system. A recent open letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) supported the concept of a youth allowance that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . offers the opportunity to simplify aspects of the income support system, to remove anomalies in the treatment of unemployed young people and students, and to offer greater flexibility to pursue different pathways to employment and adulthood. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This letter was signed by representatives of Anglicare Australia, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Australian Education Union, Relationships Australia, the YMCA, the YWCA and 15 other community service organisations. Could they have all got it so wrong? While they have reservations about some aspects of the government's youth allowance structure&mdash;which I will address shortly&mdash;there is clearly widespread support for the basic thrust of this new system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The open letter also raises a second factor behind the introduction of a common youth allowance: greater flexibility for our young adults. Times have changed since most honourable members grew up. Part-time work is more common, new career paths and forms of training have opened up and, perhaps more fundamentally, the vast majority of young Australians complete year 12 before leaving school. The increase in the number of students staying in school until year 12 has been phenomenal. From single figures in some states in the 1940s and 1950s, retention rates rose to 46 per cent in 1985 and now stand at about 73 per cent around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our increasingly complex and technological society is a partial explanation, as is the corresponding drop in the number of jobs previously done by unskilled labourers. More and more people are finding that they need specific training to find work at all. This means that many young people are still studying at an age when their parents were married and possibly even had a mortgage and children. The average age for first-time marriages is now close to 30 for both men and women&mdash;although in my case it was much older than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another key change to our work force is the emergence of part-time work. Since January 1990 the number of full-time jobs in Australia has grown from 6.2 million to 6.3 million. Over the same period, the number of part-time jobs has boomed from 1.6 million to almost 2.2 million. So, for the 120,000 new full-time jobs created, another 600,000 part-time positions have also opened up. The Australian Council of Social Service says that these changes have been emerging over the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10756"> past 20 years. In a discussion paper issued earlier this year, ACOSS reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic structure of the present system of youth payments was laid down in different circumstances to those faced by today's young people. Major changes in the labour market and in family relationships over the past two decades necessitate basic structural changes in youth payments. Further, the new system should be sufficiently flexible and robust to adjust to ongoing changes in the circumstances of young people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is widespread support for this bill not only from this side of the House but also by community groups&mdash;those community groups who traditionally have been reluctant to acknowledge the good work of this government. The government's new youth allowance meets all of these concerns. The bill is above all about flexibility. Young people who do not fit the so-called norm will be taken care of. Young people who complete year 12 at 16 or 17, as is common in most states, will be protected, as will students who are not able to study full time because of illness, disability or other trauma. Young people who cannot find full-time work and whose parents cannot afford to support them will be protected. For the first time the government will recognise that many young people take on responsibilities often shunned by adults and care for ill or frail parents or siblings. These people, too, will be supported through the youth allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps one of the most important features of the common youth allowance is that it will stop giving our young people more money to be unemployed than to study. At present, young unemployed people receive up to $155 a fortnight more than their peers who are studying. One witness told the employment, education and training committee during our inquiry into youth unemployment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem is that you cannot rely on people to work 40 hours a week for $220 when they can get $200 on the dole. That is one of the major problems.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This witness was a student from a New South Wales high school&mdash;not an adult, not an ideologue, not a member of the government, but a kid; one of those kids that are looking to a better future for themselves in terms of their career prospects. They can see the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disincentive in the current system. Kids are looking for an opportunity to invest in their own future. They want the incentive to invest in their careers, education and skill development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current major disincentive to study is a legacy from the former Labor government&mdash;a government that was very fond of glib phrases about the clever  country, but a government that also said to young people, `We will pay you more to be unemployed than to study,' `Improve your skills and help create that clever country,' or of course that ultimate promise, `You will never need to live in poverty.' Under the guise of being a paternalistic, caring, sharing government, it created in fact an environment that has potentially destroyed these kids' incentive and chances of having a meaningful long-term career. Our kids deserve better, not the platitudes they received for 13 years under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the changes to our work force, it is now necessary for most people to undertake some kind of training or study. Unemployment among 19-year-olds is around 27 per cent for those who have left school early, compared to 18 per cent for those who completed secondary school. What is more, just seven per cent of 19-year-olds who have completed some form of further education or vocational training are unable to find work. Other studies show that young people who have not completed secondary school are twice as likely to remain out of work for a year or more than their high school graduate peers. This is why the government wants young people to obtain a certain level of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this government is also concerned with protecting needy students. There are young people who sometimes are forced out of study. We acknowledge that. Needy families in such circumstances will not be turned aside. The youth allowance will be available to 16- and 17-year-olds who are unable to study because of circumstances often out of their control&mdash;illness, homelessness, substance abuse, traumatic home circumstances, inability to secure an appropriate place in education at that time or some other exceptional circumstance. That is real protection for the needy, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10757"> while at the same time creating the incentive to invest in their own future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor brought this situation about, Labor allowed it to continue and opportunities for our young people have suffered as a result. But these kids which Labor abandoned will not be forgotten by us. They will be protected under our provisions. Importantly, homeless people, arguably the most disadvantaged in our society, will no longer be able to fall through the net as they do at the moment. Studies from both state wide and local organisations in my electorate of Deakin suggest that youth homelessness is a growing problem in Melbourne's outer east, with up to 500 young people homeless in our region at any one time. Homeless kids are 46 times more likely to try suicide than their peers, and almost all will smoke cigarettes, marijuana or both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the people that governments are often accused of putting into the too&hyphen;hard basket. They will not be forgotten people under the youth allowance, with young homeless people eligible to receive up to $265 a fortnight, plus rent assistance of up to $98 a fortnight in some circumstances. I am also very proud that, under the Prime Minister's youth homelessness pilot project, in the eastern suburbs we have the Ringwood Extended Family Services, which, with a grant of $220,000, is actively working to help these young kids. This is the whole of government approach that I was talking about earlier on, rather than compartmentalising the responses that our community is seeking. The bottom line result is that the youth allowance will provide a much needed boost to thousands of lower to middle income families, not just those in the most traumatic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new income test, around $41,000 for families with one child at home, is more generous than Labor's $37,000 for the same family. We will also abolish the rule that cuts off Austudy for students entitled to less than $1,000 a year. It might seem like a small thing, a trivial amount; but ask a family earning less than $34,500&mdash;the current cut&hyphen;out for many families&mdash;whether an extra $20 a week will be welcome, and see what they say. What is more, once a student is entitled to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Austudy, they also receive concessions for their health needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new youth allowance also recognises that living away from home, whether to seek work or to study, costs the same for everyone. Up until now, under&hyphen;18s received less to live away from home than those aged 18 or over. I challenge anyone to demonstrate that a landlord, a utility company or a supermarket gives such a discount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the vast majority of cases, parents do have a responsibility to provide for their sons and daughters. Gone are the days when young Australians were working full time at 16 or 17, married by 21 and parents themselves soon after. It is no longer uncommon for people aged 18, 21 or even 25 to still be living at home and in full-time study. Many young people still live at home until they are married, but marry up to 10 years later than their parents did. In these cases the government believes that, if a family is affluent enough to support that son or daughter living at home, they have a responsibility to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it may sound harsh, the concept of parental responsibility versus parental self-interest must be clearly distinguished. The responsibility of parents who have the means does not end when their kids reach the age of consent, the age of being licensed to drive a car or the age when they can legally buy their first alcoholic drink. That is parenting through abdication. That is what the Labor government promoted, and we have made parenting by abdication rather than by responsibility a norm in our society. This scenario holds true for an increasing number of middle Australian families. But the government is also aware that in other families young people become independent much earlier because they are married, are living with a partner, have worked for a year or two before going back to study, or have supported themselves on a part-time wage for an extended period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allow me to give an anecdotal example of one of my constituents in terms of how this new youth allowance assists the independence which young kids are after. I recently came across a constituent, who we will call Anna. She is a 21-year-old nursing student. She has lived away from her parents since she was 16 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10758"> because of irreconcilable problems at home. She spent over two years on the dole before deciding she wanted something better in life. She finished her VCE and began her nursing degree, assisted by the youth homeless rate of Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A little over a year ago Anna began living with her boyfriend, an apprentice. After they had been living together for a year, Anna told the Austudy office about her relationship, as she was required to do. Here her problems began. Anna was advised that, as she was living with her partner, she was not homeless anymore and that, because she was not 25 yet and had been on the dole for two years, not three, she was not considered independent yet. The Austudy office gave Anna a parental means&hyphen;test form to give to the parents, whom she had had virtually no contact with in six years, to see whether she was eligible for Austudy. They refused for the same reasons they had not supported her for the past six years&mdash;the abdication of parental responsibility. So her application was rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure honourable members would appreciate Anna's frustration. By her own admission, she could have lied about her boyfriend or dropped out&mdash;after all, the dole currently pays more than Austudy. But this articulate, determined young woman does not want to trade in her textbooks. She says that nobody is going to make her lower her standards or change her ambitions. Instead, Anna has paid her way this year by working a part-time job that brings in less than $100 a week. She earns so little that her earnings would not even affect her Austudy entitlement if she could receive it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, under the youth allowance, people in unusual circumstances like Anna's will no longer be allowed to fall through the holes in the safety net. Under the provisions being debated here, a de facto relationship of two years is regarded as grounds for independence from parental means. Under the new rules, Anna will be considered independent of her parents' means once she and her boyfriend have lived together for two years and because she has spent two years searching for work. I think most honourable members would agree that, after five years of support 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing herself through job searching and study, this young lady is quite independent of her parents now and has been for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like 70,000 other students around the country, she will also become eligible for rent assistance for the first time under the common youth allowance&mdash;something which was not available under the previous Labor government. My constituent is just one of 137,000 young people who will receive more money under the youth allowance&mdash;more money, not less money, as the other side keeps claiming. For 67 per cent of young people on income support, payments will not change; but they will benefit from increased flexibility as they progress through study to seeking work and in the event that they fall ill. I am more convinced than ever that this long&hyphen;overdue reform will better look after young people in financial need, give them the opportunities to invest in their future and give them the flexibility that they are after in their careers. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speakers and other conservatives would have us believe that they have the power of divinity in creating loaves and fishes. They would have us believe that they can deliver savings measures through the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill</XREF>  and other cuts delivered in the last two budgets and, at the same time, improve the lot of young people who depend upon income support. Clearly that proposition is fallacious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of conservatives in this debate have talked about the desire to stamp out dole bludgers. They have said that people do not want to work. The coalition would have us believe that unemployment is caused by the unemployed themselves. They ignore the fact that unemployment has got worse during the term of their office, and they now want to scapegoat the unemployed for the consequence of the last two budgets. That is what this legislation does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nearly one&hyphen;third of young people currently receiving income support will be worse off under the common youth allowance. It will slug low income families with unemployed kids living at home. It will make life a lot 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10759"> harder for the kids who cannot live at home. It will make many of them destitute. I have met a number of young people in my electorate who will be made destitute by this legislation explicitly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government heralded this package of changes by saying that it would simplify all of the payments which young people are eligible for&mdash;it will roll them into one payment. The common allowance is, of itself, not a bad thing. When it is attached to a savings measure, however, it becomes a problem. This legislation is a savings measure, despite coalition assertions to the contrary. The overall costs and savings for 1997-98 and the out years were not released with this legislation, as they usually would be. The government have already cut Austudy by half a billion dollars in the last budget. That is a fact that is not lost on the students of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government confessed that around 11 per cent of young people will be completely cut off from support under the new arrangements. This is because all young people under 21 who would be entitled to payments under the current allowance conditions will be subject to parental means tests. The government's own figures indicate that 7,700 of those young people who will be cut off from income support live away from home&mdash;that is, they live without parental support and they will not be provided with support from the state. And yet coalition members come into this place and argue their attack on youth incomes is not a savings measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to rent assistance. The bill introduces rent assistance for all independent students. This was not previously available under Austudy, that is true, however there have been cuts in other areas. In their announcements the government touted figures of up to $98.80 per week for rent assistance. However, in order to obtain this amount a young person would have to be a sole parent with three children. Not even the prodigious efforts of the Lyons Forum would see most young people falling into that category! Most people would be single and living in a group house, in which case they would be eligible for up to $50 per fortnight&mdash;just over half the maximum rate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of problems with the definition of homelessness in this legislation. One of the major difficulties in providing adequate income support for young people has been the definition of homelessness  so that young people who are unable to live at home are not disadvantaged. Earlier this year I raised a number of issues relating to homeless students in my electorate who are unable to prove under the Austudy guidelines that they are genuinely homeless. Those guidelines were tightened so that the government could make good their half a billion dollar cut to Austudy. Indeed, I have been advised of cases where a young person has had an injunction order out on their parents arising from violence and Austudy has promptly turned around and told them that they do not fit the guidelines for being independent and that they will be assessed against their parents' income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's safety net for the young homeless hardly exists. The government would rather force young people into less than satisfactory circumstances than support them through education and training or into employment. This proposal does not address the problems that have been previously identified in assessing young people as homeless. The criteria for homelessness are very strict. There are many young people who, for various reasons, cannot live with their parents. However, the government refuses to acknowledge these reasons and maintains that these people have `chosen' to live away from home, that people `choose' to have a life on the streets in preference to an idyllic family version.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the reality for many young people in Australia is that the idyllic nuclear family that obviously a lot of coalition members have in mind simply does not exist and that they do not have a choice but to live away from home. That is why they live away from home. That is why they choose poverty over a home environment. It is the government's role to ensure that these young people complete their education or at least support them through their education and their efforts to get into employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously, those students assessed as not being homeless would not be eligible for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10760"> Austudy. Many of these students would drop out of school because they could not afford to support themselves. Under the previous arrangements, if they tried to find work and were unsuccessful they could at least qualify for some assistance from the Commonwealth in the form of the youth training allowance or newstart allowance; that is, they would not be left utterly destitute. However, under the new arrangements they will get nothing because there is only one payment. Young people will fall through the cracks, and there will be no safety net underneath those cracks to pick them up if and when they fall through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At best, a lot of these kids will get $72.50 a week, which will start to reduce once their parents' income reaches $23,350 per year. For a one-child family, the allowance will be cut out completely once the family income reaches $41,576 if the child lives at home or $58,791 if the child lives away from home. For young people under 18 who live away from home but whom the government refuses to recognise as being homeless, their income support will be paid to their parents. So, in the case of a number of young people in my electorate whom the government refuses to recognise as being homeless but who absolutely are homeless, the money will go to their parents. This means that, even if someone has good reason for not living at home, the government will maintain the fiction that they are at home and thereby leave them destitute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a young person is able to be assessed as being homeless, which is very difficult indeed, they would be entitled to $144.65 per week&mdash;nearly double the absolute maximum rate for those people whom the government refuses to acknowledge as being homeless, at $72.50 a week&mdash;nowhere near the $200 that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Barresi), talked about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to remember that the rate for a person assessed by the government as being homeless is not reduced according to the parental means test. I believe the parental means test is unfair. It is not fair to assess a young person's income support needs based on their parents' income when they are living away from their parents.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth definition of `independent' is very strict and will not be satisfied by a large number of young people currently living away from their parents. The Commonwealth has conceded this and has even put a figure on the number of people who will be knocked off benefit. The government estimates that 12,800 young people under 21 will no longer receive any form of income support because of the parental means test, and a further 33,960 will have their payments reduced once their family's income reaches $23,350 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final effect of this means test is that nearly a third of the young people currently receiving income support will be worse off under the youth allowance. That is a country mile away from the sorts of figures that various government members were touting as evidence that lots of young people will be better off under this legislation. This is a budget savings measure. The government is making good on ripping income support from young people. It is nothing more than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the parental means test will be based on the Austudy means test&mdash;that means test created quite a few problems earlier this year; you might remember, Madam Deputy Speaker, the debacle with the government's previous means test&mdash;and will consist of a parental income test, a parental assets test and an actual means test. The latter test, the actual means test, is the same one which caused huge problems for students earlier this year and which was a complete embarrassment for the government. It meant that many young people did not take up their eligibility for places in education because they were told that they would not be eligible for income support. Later on, when the government changed its mind, they missed crucial enrolment points, had already withdrawn or would not be able to catch up on their studies. Many students did not get determinations until April&mdash;three months after the commencement of the academic year for secondary students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So basically we have a situation where many homeless secondary students who were not granted homeless status by the government will have to complete their secondary studies with a maximum of $72.50 in their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10761"> pockets per week. If they do not go to school they will get nothing, even if they are trying  to find work. That is the bottom line of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, they will not be eligible for rent assistance. For every dollar their parents earn over $23,350 per annum, their income will be reduced until it cuts out completely once their parents' combined income reaches $38,340. To make matters worse, the government will pay this money to their parents. It is just beyond comprehension how young homeless people will get that money when there has been a dramatic family breakdown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people under 18 who do not have year 12 or the equivalent will be required to be in full-time education or training unless they are specifically exempted from this requirement and, if they are not, they get nothing. In the ACT we have one of the highest retention rates to year 12 in the country. However, there are some students in the ACT and in my electorate for whom year 12 is simply not appropriate. They do not want to be in the classroom. It is not appropriate that they be in the classroom. They would prefer other options, such as vocational education, apprenticeships and the like. Many people who do not complete year 12 as an 18-year-old go back and study later, when it is better for them to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a cynical exercise to reduce unemployment statistics without creating jobs. That is, in large part, what forcing students back into year 12 when they do not want to be there is about. It is about taking over 33,000 out of the jobless statistics without creating any jobs. This is an utter smoke and mirrors trick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the extra funding for the education system to support those students? The government has made no provision for additional funding to assist these students, particularly those who must surely be assessed as having special need. Teachers and educational experts across the country have expressed grave concern about the impact this will have on the quality of education. They fear the impact on students who want to study by students who are forced to study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction in the amounts of money that students are able to earn will also create a lot 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of problems. There are explicit disincentives in this legislation for students to find part-time work. Remember that part-time work or any work for students, whether they be secondary or tertiary, is often seasonal in nature. That is why examining their income on a per annum rather than per fortnight basis is so important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed allowance will assess students' income on their gross income rather than their taxable income. This means that, for every dollar that students are able to earn over the tax threshold, they will lose some of their entitlements to income support without regard to any legitimate deductions that they may have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, contrary to its rhetoric, wants to stop young people from working to their full capacity. Currently, students receiving Austudy are able to have their income assessed on their gross annual income and the entitlements over the year. This bill will see students' income assessed on a fortnightly basis, which will create very real problems given the seasonal nature of students' working lives. It means that a student who starts the year as qualifying for income support will not be able to earn more than $230 per fortnight before they start to lose their entitlement. But with the coalition's youth wage plans maybe that is not such a danger. We all know what the youth wage plans are. They were enunciated in Fightback in 1993, and they were brought out again and dusted off earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) maintains that this will not be a problem as students will be able to accrue an income bank of $6,000 per annum so that when they earn less than $230 per fortnight they will be able to gain credit for weeks where their income is higher than $230 per fortnight. This will be a bureaucratic nightmare. There is no doubt about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the experience of many tertiary students is that the first two months of the year are the months where they are most able to maximise their income earning opportunities, as this is when more casual work is available and they are able to fit work in with their studies. Many students use these oppor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10762"> tunities to finance their studies for the rest of the year. For many students who will qualify for the youth allowance for the first time when they enter tertiary education their first weeks of entitlement will be during January, a time of the year when income earning opportunities are nearly optimum for most. This means that a student qualifying for the youth allowance for the first time in January will have no income bank accrued and, if they earn more than $230 per fortnight during that month, their Austudy will be reduced, regardless of the fact that they may have little or no income earning opportunities later in the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept of an income bank is basically the same as the earnings credit scheme, which the government abolished last year because it was a failure, it was unworkable. This proposition of an earnings bank will similarly be unworkable and it will create an absolute bureaucratic mess at the start of the year, when students are on benefit, kicked off benefit and then have to reapply for benefit. Many of those students will arrive in backbenchers' offices to complain about the inadequacies of the Austudy system. In this legislation we have a disincentive for young people currently receiving income support to find work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed legislation has a provision to allow young people who were receiving income on or before 17 June 1997 to continue to receive that support through the implementation period and after 1 July 1998. This is reasonable as it ensures that the young people who are currently in receipt are not cut off. However, there are still some problems for the cohort of young people who are currently in receipt of income support. If a young person in receipt of income support gets a job before 1 July 1998, they will lose their entitlement to receive income support after 1 July 1998, unless they are able to maintain themselves in paid employment for 18 months. That is clearly impossible for the majority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the government's attack on security of tenure under the Workplace Relations Act, moves to contract work and the peeling away of protections against unfair dismissal, some young people may not be confident of holding 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a job for extended periods. The polls show that most people are concerned about security as the No. 1 issue. That is a pretty fair observation. Who can blame young people who believe that their best option for securing an income to feed, shelter and clothe themselves is to stay on income support when the government introduces such a bureaucratic, complex nightmare where you are kicked on benefits, kicked off benefits and have to reapply to get back on benefits&mdash;and around the merry-go-round we go?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, the government is implementing this ideological agenda that assumes most families in Australia provide good support for their offspring and that there are a couple of minor exceptions to that&mdash;and they have some policies characterised in this legislation to take care of the so-called homeless. But the reality is that most homeless students will not be caught by the safety net of this legislation. That is a real problem for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contention of the government that this is not a savings measure, that they are making the lives of young people better with this legislation, is extremely difficult to contemplate when it is a savings measure, when there are real dollars being ripped out of income support by this legislation and by the budget. Coalition members cannot continue to pretend that they are delivering the loaves and fishes for young people. They clearly are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us return to some of the assumptions enunciated by previous speakers on the coalition side where they talked about getting the dole bludgers. The challenge for government has to be to stimulate jobs growth. It has to be about providing employment opportunities for those who want them and supporting them through the education systems so they are able to secure employment opportunities that are available. The priority of government should not be about making young people scapegoats, ripping income support away from them and pretending that young people do not want to work to cover up the government's own inadequacies.</PARA></SPEECH>

The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill</XREF>  legislation introduces a very courageous and appropriate reform of the wide range of confusing and often conflicting allowances, which were often embedded with great anomalies, across Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of those allowances worked against the interests of young people and families and created much resentment and antagonism&mdash;even between families in the one community who saw their next&hyphen;door neighbours receiving allowances&mdash;and set up controversy and rivalry. Unfortunately, in the last few years, the allowances even promoted cheating and people said, `Well, if they're getting an allowance next door, then we want it too and we will cheat to get it.' That is a fact of life, and honourable members of the opposition should acknowledge that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance policy is one of a number of measures which will be designed to tackle some very serious problems in this country. We inherited from the last government's bad policies&mdash;in some cases because of economic change and social change in this nation&mdash;unacceptable levels of youth unemployment. It is our responsibility in government to do all we can to tackle some of the problems causing youth unemployment. One of those is that there has been in Australia too many young people leaving secondary schools in Australia before attaining adequate training and education up to year 12. We all know that by obtaining a good sound secondary education young people will be better equipped to get employment in Australia and the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirty per cent of our young unemployed people can be directly traced as people who have left school early and not completed their secondary education. They then find that they cannot get work because they are not adequately educated and trained and become very depressed. Regretfully in Australia we have a terrible youth suicide toll, particularly in country Australia. I know these things; you know them. We are all members of parliament, and we have to see them too often. I have had people come into my office for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> many months and years asking that the parliament address these issues. This legislation simplifies the youth allowances and treats young people the same way and gives them the same incentives and encouragement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give some examples of what will happen. As a member representing a part of regional Australia, I and a number of other members have fought for years to assist families with young students going away for further education&mdash;to Melbourne, Sydney or wherever else&mdash;because there is not a university or training facility available in the country or region, to get some further assistance on top of Austudy for their accommodation. I am delighted to see that the work of my colleagues&mdash;and perhaps to some small extent my own&mdash;has brought about in the new government a willingness to introduce from 1 July next year rent assistance for eligible students from country towns in my electorate and elsewhere in Australia who go away to pursue their further studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a fantastic reform. I am sure that even members of the opposition know in their hearts that it is going to be a tremendous help. It is a great burden for families in country areas to bring up their children in the home, still have children in secondary and primary schools and have one of their children, or in some cases two or three of their children, finishing secondary and wanting to go on to university and other studies away. Families have been doing without in many cases&mdash;and I know many of them&mdash;in order to cope with the extra costs their family incurs to provide for the board, lodging and rent of their student children in the capital cities. Being a father myself and having had children go away to receive their university and other education after secondary school, I have some idea of the huge  financial burden that country parents and families have to bear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation provides a rent assistance program to eligible students, and it is a wonderful reform. What it also does is make it less attractive for young people to give up secondary school. Many of us know&mdash;as parents or as friends of those with children&mdash;that there have been instances in Australia where young people have come home to their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10764"> parents and said, `Mum, Dad, we're leaving school. We're not staying on. Furthermore, if you don't let us do what we want, we know that we can access, if we leave home, certain support allowances and even apply for the dole.' Fortunately, that did not happen in my case. Although I do remember my eldest son saying that he wanted to join the police force&mdash;he thought that was better. But he was four years too young anyway. We had to persuade him to stay on at school&mdash;and he did, thank goodness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that, in some cases, students in Australia have been saying for a long while&mdash;and we have all heard it; be honest&mdash;with the pressure and stresses of study and the commitment and sacrifices students have to make, `It's not really worth me putting effort into my studies and giving up the good life and the other things I see some of my friends enjoying. After all, their unemployment benefit allowances are more than I get if I am a student.' Students on Austudy or  part Austudy have often said that. We know that is the case. There are a large number of young people who have actually dropped out of school and, unfortunately, put pressure on their families, challenged their families, and gone out and gone on welfare support and gone on to become long-term unemployed&mdash;not all, but a lot. That has to be addressed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This youth allowance policy will encourage students who are so inclined to stay at school and help them. This policy is not our only policy to address these problems. For example, we are implementing in secondary schools across Australia the very new apprenticeship and training programs, which I have been associated with for a long while now. We are going to introduce more interesting and challenging curriculum choices in secondary schools. Seventy per cent of secondary students in Australia do not wish to pursue university education because, in many cases, they have found the curriculum not challenging and engaging and thus lose interest in school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next year we will introduce vocational education and training policies where students can start their apprenticeship training while at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> secondary school. So when they stay on and are stimulated by this, they will be able to do work experience during their holidays and get experience with tradespeople, make contacts and friends for the future. When they graduate in year 12, their certificate will show that they are partly qualified in their apprenticeship training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when they go and ask for an apprenticeship opportunity with businesses&mdash;small business and medium sized enterprise in Australia particularly&mdash;they will be much more attractive to the small business because they will have part qualifications in their VCE certificate for their training and they will also have shown a commitment because they will have achieved. This is a fantastic policy. It is part of the whole refreshing approach of this government to youth policy and improves our performance in education and training and tackles the problem of long-term youth unemployment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also be introducing the very interesting program where schools will become involved in employment programs through the jobs pathway program. I had the pleasure of launching a program, which involved 11 secondary schools in my electorate, the other day where the Albury&hyphen;Wodonga Continuing Education Centre as the broker, with a number of schools in my electorate, will work with schools to help the students find a pathway from school into employment. I recommend members have a read of those policies because they are fantastic policies. There is a lot of enthusiasm about this policy. In fact, I have had schools ring me and say, `Lou, we weren't included in those 11 schools. How can we get into the list?' I have told them that they can apply in the next round. That is an indication of the enthusiasm that is coming about in this country due to these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to also say that an estimate of 70,000 young students will benefit from this legislation by becoming eligible for the rent assistance I referred to earlier in my contribution, which means an average of an extra $31 per fortnight in many cases. We are also improving some of the Austudy allowances that are available to our young students in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10765"> Australia. For example, 41,000 students will benefit from the abolition of the $1,000 per annum Austudy minimum entitlement requirement. It was a stupid anomaly that should never have been there and it has been removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sixteen thousand students will benefit from independence criteria, which are more lenient than those which currently apply when seeking Austudy under the age of 25 and 19,900 former students will gain from the abolition of the education leave awaiting period. Time does not give me the opportunity to explain fully those matters, but members can obtain details of those policies. Above all, many parents will find with the family allowances that they will also be able to better cope with the costs of bringing up young children while they are still at secondary school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth policies deserve the full support of all members. I noted with interest a lot of the comments of members of the opposition. They seem to be wanting to support it, but they have obviously been restrained somewhat by their shadow minister for education and youth affairs, who wants to grandstand and appear to be taking some different role in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just say to members of the opposition: give the government a go. Do not frustrate this legislation. You had 13 years in government and you failed miserably. We have the worst unemployment level for young people in Australia. We have an unacceptable number of young people leaving secondary school before attaining year 12. We had a very low performance level in apprenticeships. In fact, the Labor  government has almost destroyed the apprenticeship system in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Labor opposition: get out of the road, you had your chance and you blew it. The government deserves the opportunity to implement programs for our young people&mdash;our greatest asset in this nation. We want to see those programs available to them from the new year so there is no further delay in that regard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. Yes, I did see this morning's newspaper reports of fresh revelations apparently from files released from the former Republic of East Germany. Some of the allegations in them are very disturbing, not to say very lurid. The House will be aware that the review on foot, established by Athletics Australia, has terms of reference. This is a review that is independent of government. But, that said, I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10766"> would like to state once again that this government is committed to Australian sport not only being drug&hyphen;free but being seen to be drug&hyphen;free. In these circumstances, it is important to examine some of the facts of this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of those is that no appointment has been made. I am advised that there is no contract between Dr Arbeit and Athletics Australia and that therefore the issue of termination of any such contract simply does not arise. But when you look, more importantly, at the terms of reference of the review, the fourth element of those terms of reference has it that the review shall take into account any substantiated evidence coming to light about Arbeit and recommend whether he would be an appropriate person to fulfil the position of director of coaching.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of these allegations this morning, it is plain that Athletics Australia, in their review, have a responsibility to take into account in their assessment of that element of the terms of reference any of these apparent facts that have come to light this morning.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. I am aware that the Labor Party's recently announced policy proposes the abolition of the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act. It is a quite incredible proposition when you think of the implications of this policy from the Labor Party. You only have to look back over the last six or 12 months to see the operation of the secondary boycotts part of the Trade Practices Act, discouraging people from taking unreasonable industrial action which otherwise would be at great cost to export income and to jobs in the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only the other day in the coal industry that the expected 72-hour national industrial action to be taken by the CFMEU was shortcut by the fact that they knew that they would be facing a section 45D action if they did so. As a result, we preserved jobs and preserved export income for Australians, including rank and file members of the CFMEU. It is only this year that we had the Transport Workers Union going off to the Industrial Relations Commission after having done a deal with some big employers trying to use the Industrial Relations Commission to force big pay increases on small operators in the transport business, which would have meant increased costs right across regional Australia, both in businesses and in living costs. That was defeated by the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have since seen the TWU run an industrial campaign by way of secondary boycotts against a whole raft of small and medium sized businesses. Fortunately, because of the operation of the Trade Practices Act, the ACCC has been able to come in on behalf of small business and take legal action to prevent the thuggery of the TWU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people in their policy want to give a green light to unlawful illegal industrial action. If you want a classic case not just from the last 12 months since we have been in office and since these provisions have been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in effect, go back to the time when Labor was in office and they were trying to sell ANL. This country had to suffer a week of industrial action by the MUA preventing the then government of the day  fulfilling and implementing a policy it had outlined. The reason it was unable to do so was because the MUA was running secondary boycotts all around the country, again at the cost of Australian jobs and at the cost of Australian exports. Now these people have the cheek and the gall to suggest that we would be better off if we repealed the secondary boycott provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, the other point to be made about secondary boycott provisions is that they discourage more strike action. Before we were elected, the Labor Party was saying, `Well, if the coalition gets in, there will be a third world war and a lot of industrial strife.' Has there been more industrial strife? No. If anything, there has been less. The figures that came out yesterday showed that rather than there being industrial chaos and mayhem, the reality is that these provisions and others that we have introduced have discouraged illegal industrial action and have worked towards a much more cooperative attitude in the workplace. This is a crazy policy that the Labor Party has announced. They deserve to be condemned from one end of the country to the other.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Probably all Australians will be glad that Telstra has now been floated with such overwhelming support from the Australian public, with nearly five times the subscription applications than the number of shares on offer. Nearly 1.8 million Australians wanted to be part of this and 92 per cent of Telstra employees tried to be part of it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the estimates that was given out by the Australian Stock Exchange was that maybe 300,000 new shareholders have begun to own shares in Australian equities as a result of the Telstra privatisation. The Australian Stock Exchange estimates that this may well have taken Australian direct share ownership to 22 per cent and indirect share ownership to 36 per cent. That would in world terms be quite high, certainly of the level of the UK, higher than Canada and maybe a little less than the United States&mdash;one of the highest in the OECD.</PARA>

The reason the bill was passed is that it gives $4.9 billion over four years for child&hyphen;care assistance in this country; an extra 83,000 places over four years for additional child&hyphen;care places in this country; a $1.2 billion allocation this year, which is an increase of 18 per cent over two years; a school&hyphen;age care policy with an increase of $11 million over four years; better planning&mdash;I heard the shadow minister herself say that the better planning processes were absolutely necessary for future stability in the child&hyphen;care industry in this community&mdash;and continued commitment to quality. These are the issues that are important.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HQ5">Mr FAHEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure all honourable members of the House along with the honourable member for Stirling would be interested to see the activities that have occurred on the stock exchange since Telstra was listed on Monday. Trading amounted to about 308 million shares on Monday and about 260 million shares on Tuesday. There seems to be some slackening, as is expected, some stabilisation, and at about 1.30 today about 78 million shares were traded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10770">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen a considerable amount of speculation as to who was involved in the buying and selling of these shares in the initial period after the listing. One thing I do know is that a number of the trade union investment funds have invested in the Telstra shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding the fact that the Labor Party did not want the Australian people, including trade unionists, to acquire shares in this great Australian company, and notwithstanding the fact that Telstra employees&mdash;all 92 per cent of them who are eligible&mdash;invested in this particular offer, we have seen the trade union movement, on behalf of its members, whom the ALP purports to represent, investing in a significant fashion. In fact, I think in the top 20, at about No. 3, is Axiom, which is the New South Wales public sector superannuation fund, now in private hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They know, for the benefit of their members, that this is a good investment. They know that privatisation very much assists the way in which this country can expand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What we now have is total confusion in the Labor ranks on privatisation. We see that the Labor Party here in Canberra, despite what it said in government, is now opposing all privatisation. It sought to stop the sale of one-third of Telstra, despite the fact that the unionists and employees wanted those shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the New South Wales government wants to sell off the power generation in that state. Who is opposing it? The trade union movement. Of course, we know that most of the decisions here that have been taken on privatisation come from the fact that there is now some Democrats infiltration into the ranks of the Labor Party, and we know that they oppose privatisation at all times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would probably help members opposite to avoid this confusion, to overcome this difficulty, if I referred them to the editorial in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is compelling evidence that the Australian capital market is now sufficiently sophisticated to fund essential infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That could have been a quote from the current Leader of the Opposition a couple of years 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ago. He said those sorts of things on a regular basis. The editorial went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The</EMPHASIS>  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  believes governments do not have the intrinsic capacity to manage infrastructure assets more efficiently than the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, before Telstra went to the market, we had the Labor Party telling all who wanted to listen to them that the Australian capital markets would not be able to absorb one-third of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to overcome any difficulties that might exist, whilst I have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> editorial in front of me let me go on to say what it said about the way in which this particular float occurred on Monday under the guidance of the government. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . evidence of Monday's float shows it got the Telstra listing parameters just about right.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I go to the second part of the honourable member's question. Considerable information will be mailed to all retail investors on 1 and 2 December. That information will contain relevant details about the instalment receipts. There will also be an information sheet which will respond to the questions that were most asked through the telephone share information centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who has shares&mdash;the 1.9 million small Australian investors&mdash;and who is seeking information at this stage can obtain that by telephoning the Telstra share information centre on 1800 18 18 18. We have already put full advertisements in newspapers around the country. The refund cheques will also be sent&mdash;that is, the cheques for those amounts that were not able to be satisfied from those small investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that 75 per cent of all small Australian investors got what they asked for&mdash;up to 2,000 shares and 20 per cent of the residue.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. It is a very serious matter that the Labor Party is now proposing reforms to the industrial relations system that will have a very serious impact on the housing industry and the nature of employment in the housing industry. This country has, for residential purposes, a very efficient and highly competitive housing industry which has meant that many more Australians have been able to enjoy their own home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party, in its recent policy announcements, announced that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the protections of the industrial relations system should be extended beyond a narrow definition of employees to include those in employment&hyphen;type relationships.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is an old favourite within the Labor Party. They basically want to take people who are independent&mdash;small business people working on their own&mdash;and force them, through the award system, to be employees and thus within the reach of the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a step basically to coerce people into the trade union movement and to overturn what has been a tremendously successful system for the benefit of literally hundreds of thousands of Australians. This policy of theirs, which also includes the abolition of the Employment Advocate, removes one of the protections that we built into the system so that, if you are being bludgeoned or coerced by a union to join a union, there is a government body to whom you can go and it can give you some protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the Labor Party want to do? They want to abolish the protection! Why do they want to do it? Because the CFMEU, which has got a very strong grip on the commercial building sector, wants to be able to widen its reach into the residential sector, to the cost of every Australian family. This proposal would crush any sense of initiative and entrepreneurial flair which we have in the building industry; it is the modern day equivalent of press&hyphen;ganging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequences of this so&hyphen;called reform are very grave indeed. We have been in communication with the Housing Industry Association. This is not a new issue to them because they have been fighting Labor Party proposals similar to this one for years. They have given us some figures which give you a sense of the extent to which the subcontracting system in Australia would be affected. They make the point that in this industry alone this proposal could directly affect something like 140,000 people. In terms of the costs which could be imposed on the building industry, this is what they have said to me in a fax which we received yesterday:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10772">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labour costs in the housing sector would rise by up to 30 per cent through the application to trade contractors of award conditions and other industrial add&hyphen;ons mandated by unions such as C+BUS and ACIRT, without any offsetting productivity gains.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As labour costs represent about 50 per cent of the cost of a new house, this would push up the cost of an average house by $18,000 (30 per cent of 50 per cent of $120,000 being the house component of a typical $220,000 house and land package).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This brings home to ordinary Australians the potential impact of this crazy policy. The subcontractors in the housing industry of Australia have done a fantastic job for Australian families. It is a great system. In that industry, it is the heart and soul, if you like, of small business and all that the small business community represents to this country. You in the opposition have announced a policy which is basically to undermine, to erode and to set the trade union leadership on to these good Australians who are doing a great job for our country. You deserve to be condemned for this. This is a mad policy, a crazy policy, that all Australians who want to own their own home or want to add on to the home that they have got will roundly condemn. I say that on this issue alone this government will campaign all the way to the next election, whenever it is, and you will regret the day such a policy was ever announced.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for her question. The House would be aware that Centrelink is the government's new one&hyphen;stop shop for services from five Commonwealth government departments, including the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service. The aim of Centrelink is to provide services that are easy to use and much simpler to access by members of the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to inform the House that yesterday the Australian Industrial Relations Commission certified an agreement for the 26,000 staff of Centrelink. The staff of Centrelink make up 20 per cent of the total APS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement is a win for employees, it is a win for the employer, Centrelink, and, most importantly, it is a win for the clients of Centrelink. What this means is that clients&mdash;members of the public&mdash;will be able to access services from Centrelink after hours and on weekends. This confirms the government's commitment to providing better service to the general community. This is the object of the Public Service reforms which are being promoted by the government: to ensure that members of the public get the kind of service from government agencies that they are entitled to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all those involved in the development of this agreement, an agreement which has been overwhelmingly endorsed by some 75 per cent of Centrelink staff. It provides for an overall pay increase for staff and for the simplification of allowances. Above all&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;it provides a family friendly environment which facilitates part&hyphen;time work for flexibility and provides a school holiday care subsidy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More flexible hours is an example of the innovations in service delivery to the community which Centrelink is pioneering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think members of the public have already been impressed that when they walk in the door they are now frequently greeted by name because they have been able to make an appointment and there is a staff member there 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10773"> waiting to receive them and provide them with services. There is a focus within Centrelink on providing clients with decisions on the spot rather than forcing them to wait for months. One of the indicators of the importance that is being placed on client service provision is the fact that some 1,200 of the most experienced officers in the agency have been put on the front desk to serve clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an example of the new Public Service, which the government strongly supports. It is there to serve the public. It is a Public Service which will be greatly enhanced by the new Public Service legislation which is now in the Senate. It is deeply regrettable that the Australian Labor Party is taking such a negative attitude to improving service to the public in this legislation by the amendments that it is using in the Senate. But this government is going to continue to persist in ensuring that government services are there for the general public of Australia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that the honourable member for Oxley's basic view of the world is that we should disengage from it almost totally and become a country in complete isolation from the rest of the world and the universe, but that is not a proposition. I also appreciate that the member for Oxley is totally opposed to Australian foreign aid, with the sole exception of North Korea as I understand it, from a press release she put out calling for more aid to be given to North Korea. Why the member for Oxley should be so interested in North Korea and nowhere else, I am not sure. If the member for Oxley is so concerned about linking human rights with aid&mdash;and I will come back to that&mdash;you might like to reflect on why you are so much in favour of giving aid to North Korea, which is not a country with an astounding record on human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the government does not link human rights to development assistance. There are exceptions to that, but in the normal course of events we do not do that.

The member for Oxley might be interested to know that the average per capita income in Indonesia is somewhere, I think, off the top of my head, in the vicinity of six per cent of the average per capita income in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I probably reflect the views of the vast majority of Australians when I say that in this country not only do we believe we have a moral obligation to assist people around the world in need as best we can&mdash;and we happen to think that is not a bad thing to do&mdash;but also we think that as a country it is in our national interest to be seen to be doing so and to be improving living standards in countries like Indonesia and Cambodia, which you mentioned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable for Hinkler for his question. We should note the interest of the member in the rail industry in Australia. I will answer the last part of the question first in regard to how that contrasts with the Labor Party's record on rail. They were never able to achieve this sort of an agreement with the states, whereas the Howard/Fischer government has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 142 years of the operation of freight rail in Australia, we have finally reached an agreement where there is going to be one organisation controlling access to the national track network from Perth right through to Brisbane. That agreement was reached last Friday in consultation with all the states and with the agreement of all the states, those states being New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland where the honourable member's seat is located.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process was begun earlier this year in Melbourne by the former minister, the member for Hume, who had the foresight to get a focus on a national vision as far as rail freight in Australia is concerned, and tried to get a far more efficient industry with on&hyphen;track rail services. With the development of this agreement we now move forward with the establishment of the Australian rail track corpora 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion which will control and negotiate track access and train paths all the way from Perth, right through the eastern states and up to Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new company will operate commercially and will generate freight growth on rail. It will create a more efficient rail network and long&hyphen;term jobs in rail. Most importantly, it will create uniformity in operating regulatory systems within the rail network in Australia. It was an historic achievement by the Howard/Fischer government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should contrast that with the Australian Labor Party's record as far as rail in Australia is concerned. They do not have a very good track record on rail. The policy they had with regard to AN saw the loss of 7,000 jobs. We have turned that around. We have privatised the operations of AN and stemmed the flow of jobs out of AN which was bleeding under Labor. That is not just the view of this government; that is also the view of some high profile people within the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to note some comments made by Senator Schacht in a Senate estimates committee hearing last week. When they were talking about the sale of AN, he said with regard to the arrangements set up under Labor:</PARA>

How much money has DEETYA put into the Richells Shipping Line venture to relocate the trainees and back the new program?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is all about expanding education and training opportunities for young Australians. Not only are there 50,000 new places in the TAFE system this year, 43,000 of which are funded by the Commonwealth, but also the states and territories agreed in this meeting last Friday to continue to grow their systems through efficiencies. This is one of the major differences between the government and the opposition. The opposition, as we know, has absolutely no compunction at all in reaching its hand into the pockets of the taxpayers year after year, taking out tens of millions and hundreds of millions of dollars, plunging the country into debt and ripping that money away from Australian families to spend it on schemes when growth can be obtained through efficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian National Training Authority, as you well know, has done an analysis which demonstrates that if every state were to operate its TAFE system at the level of the most efficient, which is Victoria, there would be efficiency gains of some $300 million to be obtained. The Commonwealth is not going to continue to pour hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money down the drain until that growth can be brought forward out of savings from those efficiencies. The ministers of the states and territories agreed to that last Friday. Mr Aquilina, from New South Wales, was unable to be present.</PARA>

I can assure him that `Their Service&hyphen;Our Heritage' has been very enthusiastically received throughout regional Australia. Large centres and small centres, including very remote communities, have displayed great enthusiasm for this program. They are particularly keen to commemorate  their local veterans in their own communities through this commemorative effort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The culmination of much of this year's activity was the widespread observance this year of a minute's silence. I commend all those members of this House who encouraged their own communities to observe that minute's silence on Remembrance Day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In just over six months, approval has been given for 100 war memorials throughout regional Australia to receive financial assistance from this government through `Their Service&mdash;Our Heritage'. That is 100 memorials in communities in locations as diverse as Oakey, Rainbow, Kimba, Jabiru, Bendemeer, Flinders Island and Yarloop which will all now be preserved or restored. In some cases, they will have a new memorial in their community. I am also pleased to announce that that 100 figure is about to become 101 because I know that, in the member for McMillan's electorate, the West Gippsland Vietnam Veterans Association are about to construct a post&hyphen;Second World War memorial in their community in the town of Drouin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional memorials and memorials, wherever they are, are indeed a very valuable resource. They are also invaluable for recording the service and the sacrifice of veterans in local communities. Many of these memorials were built after the First World War and those in many of the communities that we found through this program are in need of restoration and, in some cases, updating. They are very much a focal point for commemorative activities, not only on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day but also during other events through the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the 100 regional memorials for which grants have been approved, over 250 local community commemorative events have also been assisted, including two very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recently in the federal electorate of McMillan. The regional memorial travelling art exhibitions are also travelling around Australia&mdash;an initiative of this government funded through `Their Service&mdash;Our Heritage'.

They have been to places such as Townsville, Renmark, Hamilton in Victoria and the Northern Territory. One particular art exhibition, `Too Dark for the Light Horse', travelled to many remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. They certainly have been appreciated by those communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Their Service&mdash;Our Heritage' is a very important commemorative activity program funded by this government. I would urge all members of this House to get behind the program and make sure that the ex&hyphen;service community in their own electorates are aware of the grants that are available, because we should continue as a nation to honour the service and the sacrifice of veterans throughout Australia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

In the 1996 budget we started the START program of $520 million, which provides grants and concessions to small and loss making companies. On top of that there is the 125 per cent tax concession, which is usable by companies in Australia. We introduced this year the innovation investment fund, which is a new concept which encourages the commercialisation of research and development in Australia. In the very near future we will be moving to announce those first funds under the scheme. I am anticipating a very great success in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Richmond for his question. As I mentioned, I have heard of the NCOSS survey. It was a half&hyphen;day survey&mdash;a phone&hyphen;in. It does give me concern and it gives sensible people concern because the outcome of that survey is misleading. It will cause a continued level of undue concern to some families in New South Wales. The approach taken was to run it for half a day and just ask people to ring in and say what their immediate problem might be. It did not offer any assistance whatsoever. Indeed, it is claimed in the NCOSS survey that the fee increases are between $15 and $40 per week per child. That is grossly overstated. The national data of August 1997 indicates that community sector fee increases average around $14 per week compared with $1 per week increase for the 70 per cent of families using the private centres. The Commonwealth, under my department, has provided $8.3 million to help community service providers identify ways to restructure their operations to minimise the impact of fee increases on parents&mdash;a very commendable decision taken by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If community services choose to have more staff than required by state government regulations and/or pay above award wages, that is a legitimate service decision to make but it is not one that should be funded by the broad range of taxpayers. We are providing them with support to address their management structures and they should take advantage of that. The Commonwealth, as I mentioned earlier, has provided $1.2 billion this year&mdash;a significant increase on last year&mdash;and for the next four years, $4.9 billion&mdash;a huge amount of money for child care in this country. In New South Wales the Commonwealth support is over $300 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You asked in your question how New South Wales are dealing with child&hyphen;care issues. I think this is important, because it underlines the hypocrisy of the phone&hyphen;in that they conducted. I was surprised when I became minister and took advice about these issues&mdash;because personally child care is important to me, as it is for the member for Richmond and any other sensible member in this place&mdash;at 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10779"> the lack of progress by New South Wales to implement the jointly funded Commonwealth&hyphen;state national child&hyphen;care strategy to increase the supply of places. It is indeed quite interesting, because there is a total lack of commitment by the New South Wales government to do so. They rely on Commonwealth funded child care for child development, but New South Wales is the only state in the Commonwealth that does not have a universal policy for access to preschool year for four&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. So many New South Wales families rely on Commonwealth funded child&hyphen;care services to meet the development needs of their children&mdash;all the more reason why this strategy is so important to New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned earlier today, we passed that in this place yesterday, with the support, I might say, of everyone in the parliament. I think that was a major achievement for the government. Almost 60 per cent of the outstanding places under the growth strategy for child care are in New South Wales, and fewer than 10 per cent of those centres allocated to New South Wales have in fact actually been established. So New South Wales have not committed, as the other states have, to providing the level of places that is available under the growth strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another point I would like to make to honourable members. I think the demographics with regard to child care are important for members to understand. There are 3.4 million children in Australia aged 0&hyphen;12. Six hundred thousand of these children use Commonwealth funded child&hyphen;care services&mdash;that is about 18 per cent&mdash;and 330,000 Commonwealth funded child&hyphen;care places were in place at June 1997. Around 300,000 families&mdash;over 70 per cent of those accessing care&mdash;receive child&hyphen;care assistance. As part of the bill that was announced yesterday, the new arrangements will start after Easter, which I thought was an appropriate time for parents for that to commence, and 395,000 families as at June have actually claimed child&hyphen;care rebate. So the number of families accessing the $1.2 billion that is provided by the Commonwealth is a very substantial number. In the issues that I outlined earlier 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> today, the assistance that we provide is quite enormous.</PARA>

This group, however, said that they did not want to come to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This pattern was repeated on the second occasion. There was another boat sighted in the Torres Strait on 5 November; it had some 70 people on board. They, again, were intercepted. I think a report that I saw suggested that it was not seen by Customs. I think, for those folks in the honourable member's area, I ought to say that it was seen&mdash;they were not watching the Melbourne Cup; they were out and able to intercept it. The people, again, were quite adamant that they did not wish to come to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not shirk our international responsibilities in relation to those who have protection claims. Generally, if they are able to meet such requirements, they are able to stay; if they are not, we remove them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is ongoing cooperation between countries within the Pacific rim, including New Zealand. There have been a number of conferences held already. New Zealand obviously&mdash;if it is the destination that these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10781"> people have in mind&mdash;will have to look at the way in which its systems are able to meet the demands. I have met with the minister; I have discussed with him the movement of boat people. My department is certainly keeping New Zealand officials abreast of these developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I think the clear implication is that, in relation to those people who have been seeking to come to Australia before, the message is getting through; and that those who do not have bona fide claims are obviously thinking that they ought to look at other opportunities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The continuing relevance and value of the Commonwealth to its members is well demonstrated by the fact that 51 member states attended the Edinburgh meeting, 43 of them represented by their head of government or head of state. It is a particular pleasure to record that Fiji was among those members, taking its place again at the Commonwealth table with the wholehearted support of my government and other members of the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was my first CHOGM meeting, and it reinforced for me the strengths of the Commonwealth:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> it spans a broad diversity of nations, developed and developing, from all corners of the globe and representing a quarter of the world's population</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> its members share a common heritage of language, traditions and values, which forms the basis for the Commonwealth's ability to reach consensus and work constructively on many issues</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> it has perhaps the widest grassroots support amongst its member countries of any international body, with a vast network of associated organisations bringing together people from all walks of life&mdash;these personal and professional links are the lifeblood of the modern Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth also complements our key bilateral relationships and our focus on regional forums such as APEC and the South Pacific forum. It is the major avenue for our engagement with many Commonwealth 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10782"> countries beyond our immediate region. As the third largest financial contributor to the Commonwealth, Australia has a positive role in promoting the economic and social development of those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcomes of the Edinburgh meeting were good&mdash;for Australia and for the Commonwealth as a whole. I should say at the outset that the meeting's success&mdash;and its harmonious and constructive atmosphere&mdash;was greatly aided by the capable chairmanship of the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair. I was pleased to be able to work closely and effectively with him. The United Kingdom was an excellent host, and the people of Edinburgh and Scotland gave us all a warm welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time, CHOGM focused its discussions on a theme&mdash;`Trade investment and development: the road to Commonwealth prosperity'. That economic focus was reinforced by the inaugural Commonwealth Business Forum, held immediately before CHOGM. I was one of several heads of government asked to address that forum. It was an opportunity for me to argue the case for Commonwealth member countries to open their markets and economies if they are to maximise the opportunities that globalisation can offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcome of CHOGM's discussions on its economic theme was the Edinburgh Commonwealth economic declaration, `Promoting shared prosperity'. The declaration expresses the economic principles shared by Commonwealth members and is the companion to the 1991 Harare declaration, which set out the core political and human rights principles of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The declaration is significant in the degree of common ground reached among developed and developing members on the need for continuing trade liberalisation, the importance of encouraging investment flows&mdash;especially through sound macro-economic policies and financial systems, strong regulatory and supervisory frameworks and good governance&mdash;and the crucial role of the private sector in achieving economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this good outcome reflected wide support for trade liberalisation, the meeting 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> showed that we have some way to go in winning universal acceptance of the value of a new round of global trade negotiations. As I said in my address to the Business Forum, Australia believes that a new global trade round should be launched by the end of the century. There is support for a new round among other Commonwealth members&mdash;but it is not unanimous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The declaration recognises that some countries need help in adjusting to and taking advantage of globalisation. Governments need to facilitate the sometimes difficult adjustments required, and explain and manage reforms in a way which ensures community understanding and support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to advise the House that Commonwealth leaders welcomed and strongly endorsed Australia's initiative to respond to this need by establishing a Trade and Investment Access Facility under the Commonwealth umbrella. The facility will help Commonwealth members manage the potential economic and social impacts of trade and investment liberalisation. My announcement of Australia's contribution of $1.5 million over three years to start the facility was backed up by funding pledges from Canada, Britain and New Zealand. I see this not only as a practical and constructive response to the concerns of many developing countries about the impact of opening up to the global economy but also as a means of helping generate the momentum of trade liberalisation worldwide and opening up markets for our exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcome on climate change was particularly good from the point of view of Australia's national interest. Against many expectations and dire predictions of Australia being isolated on this issue, the economic declaration advanced our interests by recognising that:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> as a general principle, the costs of protecting the environment should be borne in accordance with shared and differentiated responsibilities</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> both developed and developing countries have to play a part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to solve what is a global problem</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10783">
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a successful outcome at the climate change conference in Kyoto would involve realistic and achievable goals. </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I shall have more to say in detail about that issue tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Edinburgh meeting also reinforced the importance attached by the Commonwealth to the principles of democracy, good governance and human rights set out in the Harare declaration. Heads of government confirmed the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group's mandate to respond to situations where the Commonwealth's principles are seriously or persistently violated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We bluntly told Nigeria that it must improve its human rights record and return to democracy. Nigeria remains suspended from the Commonwealth, with the Ministerial Action Group authorised to invoke various measures if it considered these would encourage a return to democracy and respect for human rights. If Nigeria's transition to democratic government is not completed by 1 October 1998, heads of government will consider its expulsion and further sanctions. We also condemned the military coup in Sierra Leone and agreed to continue its suspension from Commonwealth meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcome on membership was also positive in maintaining the integrity of the Commonwealth by emphasising the common threads which unite an otherwise diverse group. Leaders agreed that, to qualify for membership, countries should have a constitutional association with an existing member, comply with the Harare declaration and accept Commonwealth norms and conventions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as our contribution to these outcomes, Australia's strong commitment to the Commonwealth was demonstrated in my announcement of an expansion of Australia's assistance for Commonwealth sport.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is the Commonwealth's largest sports donor, seeing the social, health and economic benefits for young people of participation in sport and the important role of sport in strengthening all Commonwealth ties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will continue the successful Protea sports program in South Africa, which was due to wind up next year, and work with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> South Africa to extend it to other parts of Commonwealth Africa, with funding of $1.8 million. We will also extend support for junior sports development in the Caribbean, with funding of $1.35 million. And, subject to a review, our sports development program in the South Pacific, ASP2000, will be extended until 2006.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's support for the Commonwealth was also expressed in my offer&mdash;which was warmly accepted&mdash;that Australia host CHOGM in the year 2001. It is very fitting that Australia's Commonwealth friends will be able to join us in our celebration of 100 years of the establishment of the Australian nation. One of the great values of CHOGM is the opportunity it provides for formal and informal discussions with a range of leaders, establishing the personal contacts which are such an important part of strong bilateral relationships. It was, of course, a particular pleasure for me to meet President Mandela for the first time&mdash;he kindly invited me to visit South Africa and I reiterated how welcome a visitor he would be to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My discussions with Mr Blair in London, building on our meeting earlier this year, set the tone for our close cooperation in Edinburgh on a number of issues, including climate change. We also had a useful exchange on what is one of the few irritants in our bilateral relationship&mdash;the indexation of pensions paid to former residents of the United Kingdom who now live in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My meetings with Mr Goh Chok Tong and Dr Mahathir allowed a very useful discussion about the financial instability in South&hyphen;East Asia, including appropriate action at the forthcoming APEC leaders meeting. It was also good in the lead&hyphen;up to the Vancouver meeting to talk with this year's chair of APEC, the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr Chretien, and to discuss the Ottawa Treaty on landmines which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, will sign on Australia's behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My meeting in Edinburgh with Mr Haiveta, the Deputy Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, allowed me to hear about the drought afflicting our closest neighbour. I repeated Australia's determination to help the govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10784"> ment and the people of Papua New Guinea get through this very difficult period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My subsequent visit to Indonesia&mdash;my second as Prime Minister&mdash;coincided with developments of crucial importance to Indonesia's future, and to the future of the region. Given the timing, it was both inevitable and in keeping with Australia's deep and abiding interests in the bilateral relationship that the financial situation in the region and its implications for Indonesia were a focus of my meetings with President Soeharto and his ministers. My offer that Australia was ready to participate in any International Monetary Fund package to assist Indonesia underlined the strength of our commitment, as a friend and neighbour, both to the partnership with Indonesia and to the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region whose future Australia and Indonesia share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is not a fair&hyphen;weather friend. Our offer showed that we are a reliable neighbour and member of our regional community, prepared to help out during difficult periods. Moreover, our response has been warmly welcomed by leaders in the region and demonstrates that Australia should be confident about her place in our region and the regard in which it is held by her neighbours. It is in our national interests that the significant economic progress made by Indonesia over the last 30 years&mdash;progress which has meant better lives for the majority of Indonesian people&mdash;is continued. Stability and prosperity in Indonesia and the wider region are important for Australia, for our economic prospects and for the living standards and jobs of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is confident that the measures Indonesia has agreed with the IMF will help stabilise Indonesia's currency and lay the basis for good growth in the medium term. While I was in Jakarta, I launched a joint venture between the Commonwealth Bank and Bank Internationale Indonesia. This enterprise is a timely and strong expression of confidence in Indonesia's economic future. It is also a measure  of the growing commitment of the private sectors in both our countries to work together for mutual benefit.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our commercial relations with Indonesia are now very significant. Our two&hyphen;way merchandise trade grew by 20 per cent last financial year to $5.2 billion, and two&hyphen;way services trade grew to $1.3 billion in 1996. The numbers of Indonesians and Australians travelling in both directions are also growing strongly. About 360,000 Australians went to Indonesia in 1996 and 150,000 Indonesians came here. There were more than 16,000 Indonesians studying here in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our commitment to strengthening the relationship with Indonesia was also marked during the visit by my announcement of:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the opening of six new honorary consulates, four of them in eastern Indonesia&mdash;the region covered by the Australian Indonesian Development Area&mdash;which will give a boost to our trade and investment links</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the provision of a further $44 million over the next five years to fund short&hyphen;term training courses under the aid program</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a further contribution of $360,000 for ground firefighting training and equipment for the Indonesian fire services&mdash;as well as funds for drought relief in Irian Jaya announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When I was in Jakarta, I had the opportunity of meeting the Australian firefighting personnel from various states of Australia who have been performing such a magnificent service to the Indonesian people in their recent responses to the disastrous fires in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strong, constructive and broad based relationship we have with Indonesia provides a solid foundation for us to talk about any differences which we have, and it is important that this be stressed. On the issue of East Timor I said that, while Australia recognised Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor and would act consistently with that, we thought it desirable, both for Indonesia and for Indonesia's friends, for further progress to be made in dialogue and greater control over their own affairs by the people of East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talked about the need to agree expeditiously on arrangements fair to both sides on the exploitation of LNG in the Timor Gap. Progress was subsequently made at a meeting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10785"> between Senator Parer and his Indonesian counterpart, Mr Sudjana. President Soeharto and I also discussed the forthcoming APEC meeting and the importance of working together to strengthen APEC and to achieve its goals of free and open trade and investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude by expressing my gratitude to President Soeharto and the government of Indonesia for the hospitality extended to me and my travelling party. I present the following paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting Edinburgh, United Kingdom 24-27 October 1997 and Visit to Indonesia 28&hyphen;29 October 1997&mdash;Ministerial Statement, 18 November 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Motion (by <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Reith</EMPHASIS>) proposed:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House take note of the paper.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="10785" TIME="3.34 p.m." SPEAKER="Beazley, Kim, MP" NAMEID="PE4" ELECTORATE="Brand" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) views the outcome of his trip with a great deal of personal relief. He does so because this is the first trip that he has made overseas when he has not made a complete botch of it. This is the first trip that he has made overseas when he can come back from it to a reasonable set of headlines instead of `The Last Train to Klutzville', which represented an appropriate analysis of his previous trip overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But as trips go, for a Prime Minister, it was pretty garden average both in its outcomes and in its achievements. With some of those outcomes&mdash;at least his interpretation of them, if not the actual words associated with ultimate decisions of that body&mdash;we have some degree of disappointment. Nevertheless, there are outcomes associated with this trip with which we wholeheartedly agree, so let me start with them in the spirit of some degree of bipartisanship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first was in terms of the decisions that he took on a bilateral basis in terms of mutual development of a variety of schemes such as the consulates, which should deepen our involvement in the affairs of that nation. The second, and more important, was the guarantee that he gave the Indonesians of a preparedness to participate in any rescue package for the Indonesian currency got together by the IMF to the tune of some $1 billion. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Prime Minister, I and others need to be careful about the way in which we represent that. There is an opinion abroad that somehow or other a $1 billion cash donation has been offered to Indonesia. That is not the case; it is a currency swap. Unless circumstances which go beyond thinking in fact occur, the chances of the Australian taxpayer having to `ante up' anything is very remote indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who feel that there are domestic programs and other elements of government activity that are in some way or another at risk, have suffered or have not been appropriately supported as a result of a decision to go down this road, ought to have their fears set at rest. That is not at stake and nor was it at stake with the package that was put together recently by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in relation to Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, the sense of relief that we feel in relation to the performance of the Prime Minister on his second visit to Indonesia has yet to wipe out in the region the consequences of the government's extraordinary indecision, backing and filling and malapropisms, or whatever you like to describe it as, in their relationships with the region around us that have manifested themselves in the 18 months or so that this government have been responsible for the portrayal of Australia to what is now, as correctly identified by the Prime Minister in the case of one country, the region of our most important trading partners, both South-East Asia and North Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a very long way to go. The role as far as the Prime Minister is concerned is central to the outcome that we all desire. He has not managed to overcome the consequences of his persistent and repetitive erecting of a straw man, which ultimately was a straw man which his hosts found incredibly offensive when he denied 16 times on his first visit to Indonesia that Australia was not an Asian country, a proposition never put forward by any government. We used to define ourselves as part of the Asia-Pacific region, which is a manifest truism in geographic terms and also in economic terms. By putting that forward persistently, he put a question mark in the minds of many of his interlocu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10786"> tors as to whether or not he was trying to be offensive on the point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At least on this occasion the Prime Minister did not conduct his visit to the region with a megaphone aimed basically at Australian domestic opinion or what he thought Australian domestic opinion to be. On this occasion he actually tried to address himself to what the realities were in the countries immediately around us. He might well do so. While in the long haul there are enormous benefits for this country and there have already been enormous benefits for this country&mdash;enormous benefits that are of an economic nature apart from security concerns and concerns for our long-term survival in the region&mdash;in an enmeshment with the region, with a dialogue with the region on all levels of our society, for the next few years there is going to be a marked impact on the Australian economy of the economic troubles they are experiencing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IMF is pointing out to a number of these nations the road that they need to go to get themselves out of this situation. They will in their various ways no doubt address what is being put to them, and it is important that those points are made to them. In the interim, they are going to throw up for this country not a small number of economic problems which are going to have to be addressed by us. This is going to impact on many aspects of Australian domestic policy as well as our foreign policy. How it might impact on our foreign policy we have already seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to how it might impact on our domestic policies, you are going to find a greater requirement for activist government in industry policy as industry confronts the possibility of a decline in export markets in the region, as industry confronts the possibility of large&hyphen;scale dumping in this country from the region and as we try to get that in balance with a continuing close relationship with the region. Underpinning their currencies in that regard is not a bad start in terms of ensuring that we have not lost too much competitiveness in relations with them, but we are going to have to look to those other developments as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister also made reference in his remarks to CHOGM, which was, after all, the main purpose of his visit to the area. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Again, we join the Prime Minister in welcoming the decision of his colleagues at CHOGM that they should conduct the meeting in 2001 in Australia. It would be appropriate to have CHOGM here as part of some celebration of 100 years worth of Australian history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the House have devoted a good deal of attention to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting over the years. It has had an important influence in a not insubstantial way on a number of international issues where we have sought to play a role as the years have gone by. Nobody can forget&mdash;certainly Nelson Mandela does not&mdash;the role that the Commonwealth played ultimately in pressure over the years to bring an end to the apartheid regime that existed in South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were steady diplomatic initiatives over a lengthy period of time and a steady holding of the hands by all of us to the wheel on various boycotts that were put in place, both in the sporting area and the economic area, to keep the pressure on and to secure those changes. I guess that, as the Commonwealth did that, nobody would have believed that the outcome which ultimately did occur, would occur in the way in which it did. I think most of us foresaw over the years a picture of bloody horror as likely to be the consequence of a change to that system. But that was not to be the case. One of those international miracles occurred and there was a change of heart. I think the Commonwealth played a substantial role in assisting that process to come to a conclusion. It kept an open arm out there for those who wanted to conduct a dialogue to solve the problems and kept out there a reward for a successful conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Commonwealth is not some sort of antediluvian organisation left over from an era of international politics best forgotten. It has transformed itself into one of those useful organisations in the international community that can from time to time take up issues successfully and provide an umbrella for a series of useful initiatives. Indeed, the Commonwealth has done that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, we welcome again the fact that the umbrella has been utilised by the Prime 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10787"> Minister to extend a number of those small programs that we have in place&mdash;they have been in place since before this government came into office&mdash;which have enhanced our relationship with a number of African countries and a number of others in the sporting area, for example. Those initiatives announced by the Prime Minister today were also welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's principal concern, apart from the trade issues that he mentioned&mdash;we have no basic disagreements with the position that he adopted on that&mdash;was one he took some comfort in: the decision taken by CHOGM on issues such as international commitments, targets and so on on greenhouse gases. This was the only banana skin on which the Prime Minister slipped in the time that he was overseas on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He came out with a most extraordinary interpretation of that position on differentiation. He implied support for the notion and establishment of an international target, despite the fact that he accepted a degree of differentiation. He sought to welcome that with the most extraordinary statement of his appearance, talking about `differentiation in our time'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was perhaps, in the imperial history of this century, one of the most unfortunate allusions that he could conceivably have made, with all the overtones of failure in relation to the last time a Commonwealth&mdash;then empire&mdash;statesman made such a point when he talked about affairs in similar terms. As Gerard Henderson pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Peace in our time' pledge had an expiry date of just under 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The gentleman who made it disappeared ultimately from British politics, but when he made that statement he was saved only by the goodness of his country's citizens and the willingness of the Americans to step into the breach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rather suspect in this area the outcome is going to be much the same. The Prime Minister's position, as far as greenhouse issues are concerned, is such that he will be saved from the consequences of it only by the goodness of citizens and the intervention of the Americans. The Prime Minister's position 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in this area has been a matter of continuing embarrassment to this country. He likes to associate himself with the fact that what is going on internationally at the moment is a bargaining process. People are moving off hardline positions and moving on to agreement and compromise. Yes, that will occur; it should occur; it is very necessary that it occur. It is a process which is inevitable and has absolutely nothing to do with stands that he has taken&mdash;but it should have something to do with stands that he has taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Prime Minister ought to be doing in international affairs on this particular issue&mdash;for the last 18 months he should have been doing it&mdash;is taking out a position internationally, waving Australian tickets and saying, `We don't want a set of targets imposed on us that we cannot meet. We don't want a set of targets imposed on us where, if we find ourselves with various mechanisms in place which could produce an outcome satisfactory in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, you ignore our processes. We don't want that situation. So take a look at our ideas and take a look at what we have done.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Prime Minister invites them to take a look at what we have done&mdash;and they have taken a look at what we have done&mdash;they will see a slaying of a whole range of greenhouse initiative related environmental research programs and initiatives associated with business. They have noted that.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he also invites them to take a look at suggestions we have that make it easier for us to conform, they will see nothing in his rhetoric about things like carbon sinks which we could readily conform with and nothing in his rhetoric about exchanges in relation to the fact that we have energy efficient production of energy intensive goods and we ought to get some degree of credit for that. We have not had a government out there waving Australia's tickets and therefore enhancing our credibility. We will have more of a chance to talk about this tomorrow, so I will conclude here. But that was a most disappointing feature of his visit and we got no comfort as a nation as to any outcome that the Prime Minister managed to secure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regard this as a very serious matter. I have not been able to identify any precedent for the situation that currently confronts the House. On that basis, it requires very careful consideration. The process of debate of matters of public importance is well known and the sub judice convention is reasonably known by that term. However, its terms are not so well known and I think they do require some care and focus in this particular case.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The origin of the convention appears to have been a desire on the part of the parliament, according to the third edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To prevent comment and debate from exerting an influence on juries and from prejudicing the position of parties and witnesses in court proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are a number of cases in which this has been raised, but the essential point is that the restraint is a restraint imposed by parliament itself in order not to prejudice rights that are to be vindicated outside parliament. The situation with regard to Mr Dunn is that he is the subject of some 91 charges in the New South Wales courts and, in respect of those charges, warrants have been issued. The matter of the criminal charges is very much before the Australian courts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next step in the process, going in reverse, is that Mr Dunn has been arrested in Honduras and deported from Honduras to the United States. In the United States he was arrested again and brought before the United States courts on a provisional application for extradition by Australian authorities. He is currently, therefore, before the United States courts and he is due&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I repeat that I regard this as a very serious matter, and I think it is setting a precedent that parliament might go to regret.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter is currently before the United States courts for the purpose of determining whether he should be extradited to Australia. I have been informed today that Mr Dunn has advised the United States court that he intends to contest the extradition process, and the basis upon which he seeks to do that is an abuse of the process by which he ended up before the courts. So there is an issue before the United States courts which is directly relevant to the continuation of the proceedings before the Australian courts as to whether what has occurred in relation to his arrest, deportation, arrest and extradition has been an abuse of process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Looking in broad terms at the possibility of prejudice, I think there are two basic areas in which the possibility of prejudice arises. The fact that the allegations against Mr Dunn are the subject of such notoriety is generating debate and media comment. No doubt it is the wish of the opposition that there be debate in this House on the very issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has the prospect of influencing people within Australia who might end up dealing with the issues before the court if Mr Dunn is extradited and brought to face charges here. They might be members of courts or they might be jurors. That is one possibility. I do not know what the member for Banks (Mr Melham) is going to say, but he is not known for temperate expression.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In order to canvass the subject of whether the government has failed or not failed to take all necessary steps to secure the earliest return of Mr Dunn to face justice in Australia, we have to canvass the very facts and allegations that relate to whether there has been an abuse of process by which he finds himself in the United States facing an extradition order. In order to debate that issue, we have to go into the very issues that the United States court is going to be confronted with because Mr Dunn is going to raise them in the court.</PARA></TALK.START>

We do not go to the merits of the case; we go to the failure of this government. It is about this government; it is about the ineptitude of this Attorney-General. This Attorney&hyphen;General, when it comes to extradition matters, is a repeat offender. This Attorney-General is a recidivist when it comes to extradition matters. This is the Attorney&hyphen;General who called off the chase for Skase until he was overruled by his Prime Minister (Mr Howard).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney&hyphen;General admitted that in the House yesterday. Mr Dunn had been positively identified by a member of the Canadian police force visiting Honduras, and the Australian Federal Police had been advised. In response, the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department got in touch with the department of foreign affairs, which tasked the Australian Ambassador to Mexico and Honduras to take up the issue of Dunn's possible extradition with the Honduran authorities. That was confirmed by the Minister for Justice today when she went on ABC radio. Former Ambassador Broinowski rightly took this very seriously, and he is on the record as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look the urgency of the request to me, the instructions were quite clear indicating that the department itself was quite concerned about the matter, needed follow&hyphen;up taken&mdash;I mean it took me quite some time to get around the traps and make the appoint

I took it seriously myself professionally, my staff did and I expected Canberra would too.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ambassador Broinowski, as he was then, found the Honduran authorities both cooperative and very concerned that they should have such a person in their midst. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I saw the Acting Foreign Minister. I saw various ministers and I also went to see a chief magistrate in the Palace of Justice, had a long talk with her.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was in March. The ambassador reported directly to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and his minister. He sent a lengthy report. He followed that up with a phone call and, when it appeared that his earlier report might have gone astray, he sent a second copy. He took the matter seriously. No&hyphen;one could fault the ambassador's action. What was the response from DFAT? There was no response to the ambassador. In his own words: `All I got was a cone of silence.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What had happened? We now know, from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) yesterday, that the minister simply passed the parcel; he passed the buck. There is a very telling article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph </EMPHASIS>by Malcolm Farr, Chief Political Reporter, on page 17. It is worth quoting:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, that most aristocratic of government functions, cannot shake the accusation that it is soft on child sex abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And nor should it be allowed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revelations by former ambassador Richard Broinowski that he had reported Robert Dunn's presence in Honduras 10 months ago will help see to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Broinowski sent at least four reminders to Canberra from his post in Mexico City and the response was, bafflingly, a bureaucratic silence . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And we have a cartoon in today's paper that has the foreign minister basically tapping around, blind to what is going on around him. The problem is that they flick&hyphen;passed it to this Attorney&hyphen;General, who has form. This is the Attorney&hyphen;General, as I said earlier, who abandoned the Skase chase. This Attorney&hyphen;General has form, and part of it is a result of the cuts that this government has made in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10791"> these areas. This is ineptitude. We had the inept Minister for Justice on the radio waves this morning attacking, by inference, Mr Broinowski:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, well. Why then do we have the ABC saying: "Rick Broinowski hit the airwaves today" that's yesterday, "</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">revealing the Federal Government had sent him to Honduras in February to find out if Dunn was there and if without an extradition treaty the Honduras authorities would cooperate in sending him to Australia." Why do we have the ABC running that line yesterday?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Kelly replied, `Well', and Senator Vanstone went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because Mr Broinowski encouraged and allowed them to run that line.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have in front of me the instructions Mr Broinowski was given. Referring to Mr Dunn, they say, `His whereabouts are at present unknown, although officers of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department told me today that they had heard he might be in  Honduras.' That confirms Mr Broinowski's claims. Senator Vanstone went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And then he was asked to make some general enquiries as to the general extradition climate in Honduras.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The point is that what we have is ineptitude. What we have today is an Attorney&hyphen;General again ducking and weaving. These are not matters that will prejudice hearings in the United States or in court. They are matters that go to the Attorney&hyphen;General's ineptitude and his department's ineptitude and the ineptitude of Foreign Affairs. They go to the ineptitude of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General claims that this might prejudice a fair hearing in Australia. That is not what we are after. We do not prejudge. There is a presumption of innocence. But, with matters in the public domain, we are entitled to test this government as to their competency and their resolve to bring people back before our courts. What we see is that there was no resolve. What we see is a sitting on the hands. What we see is ineptitude by this Attorney&hyphen;General and this foreign minister. This is a matter of public interest and public importance. This is a matter that should have been given priority and followed through. We now have from within the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> department material that shows ineptitude&mdash;saying one thing and doing another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday we had different accounts from the Minister for Justice. She was trying to put it onto the New South Wales Police and was having a go at Minister Whelan in New South Wales. But she could not get the line straight with the Attorney&hyphen;General, because the foreign minister quite rightly, in answering the question yesterday in this House, pointed out that these responsibilities belong to the Australian Federal Police. And the Attorney&hyphen;General is the senior minister responsible for the Australian Federal Police in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone is now the minister responsible in the other chamber, but we do not blame Senator Vanstone because she is only a recent comer to the ministry for justice. This Attorney&hyphen;General was the relevant Minister for Justice at the time. This Attorney&hyphen;General is the person with whom the buck stops.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a cabinet and a government that prides itself on family values, access to justice and chasing down law and order issues. What do they do?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His whereabouts are at present unknown, the missive said, although officers of the Attorney-General's Department said that they had heard he might be in Honduras. This is the same message that the Minister for Justice referred to in her media interview this morning. The department advised that Australia has no extradition arrangements with Honduras either through a modern treaty or through one inherited from Britain. The department indicated that in those circumstances they had some questions which they wanted to put to the ambassador.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first question asked was whether he could give a snapshot of the Honduras legal system. That is, whether it is one which operates fairly from a criminal justice point of view in a human rights' sense and can be expected to give a fair hearing to an extradition request. The second question asked whether he knew if Honduras would be willing to extradite a person without a formal extradition treaty. The department recognised that this might not be an easy question to answer but that extradition on this basis was not uncommon in some parts of the world. A response by a particular method was requested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ambassador apparently did make inquiries and then forwarded a reply to those questions. It is not known to me whether the ambassador had any communication other than in the formal reply, and the formal reply did not refer to the issue of the presence of Mr Dunn at all. He certainly did not confirm his presence, he did not query his presence and he added no evidence as to whether or not he was there. In those circumstances, suggestions that have been permeating the media that the ambassador advised the authorities in Australia that Mr Dunn was present in Honduras seem to have no foundation at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks, in his just completed address, referred to the ambassador asserting in the media that there had been silence from the authorities. I have been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10794"> provided with information that there was a reply to Ambassador Broinowski and, in the reply, his cable was acknowledged. What action had been taken was referred to. He was asked if, in the meantime, anything else should come to his notice about the whereabouts of Mr Dunn that it would be appreciated very much if that news could be conveyed. This was just prior to the ambassador leaving Honduras and leaving the department. That seems to be the end of the story. This does not fit terribly well with what Mr Broinowski has been telling the media. On that basis, it is understandable that, until perhaps now, the member for Banks has not had access to information that corrects what Mr Broinowski has been saying. He might have been misled by the media reports of what Mr Broinowski has been saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that the member for Banks might get some information from Mr Broinowski on what he knew by contacting him directly, because Mr Broinowski plainly, in more recent information&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MELHAM" NAMEID="4T4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Broinowski seems to regard himself as being free to talk to the media. If he is free to talk to the media, I do not see why he could not talk in the same vein with the same consequences to you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of assertions were made by the member for Banks. One was that the ambassador received no response whatsoever. I have just answered that and explained that there was a response to the ambassador before he left his post. It was suggested by the member for Banks, in reading out a newspaper article, that the ambassador had reported the presence of Mr Dunn in Honduras. That is false. The member for Banks should have known, on a proper reading of other material, that what he was reading was false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks also referred to funding cuts, presumably to the AFP, which he asserts have the consequence of the AFP not doing all that was necessary. Let me say quite plainly that the funds available in early 1997 to the AFP for the AFP liaison services were identical to the funding provided by the previous government for that purpose. There 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were no cuts whatever. The funds available to the AFP for the financial year ended 30 June 1997 for Interpol liaison were identical to the funds made available by the previous government in the year 1995&hyphen;96. There has been no cut in the principal areas of operation of relevance to the chasing of a fugitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks sought to suggest that there are differences between the Minister for Justice (Senator Vanstone) and myself in relation to our attitude to the role of the New South Wales Police. There is no difference whatsoever. The New South Wales Police have responsibility for the charges. The New South Wales Police have brought charges and they have obtained warrants. The process involved is that the New South Wales Police then contact the AFP, which has responsibility for Interpol liaison for all police services in Australia. From that point on, the AFP is responsible for dealing with Interpol. But it is not done in isolation. The AFP does not act alone; it acts on the instructions and in consultation with the New South Wales Police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between January 1997 and when Mr Dunn was arrested in Honduras, the New South Wales Police did not send anybody to Honduras; nor, to my knowledge, did they send anybody from any of their offices to any of the other countries in which Mr Dunn was reported to have been sighted. It is not common practice, if someone is reported as sighted in a particular country and that person is the subject of warrants for arrest, for the police to send officers to that country to seek to bring them back. The processes involve the normal Interpol communication and then the person, once identified and apprehended on a provisional arrest request by Australian authorities, is the subject of extradition proceedings in the foreign country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All appropriate proceedings in relation to Mr Dunn were followed in this case. The New South Wales Police produced the warrants and were in close contact with the AFP. The AFP dealt with Interpol and Interpol was in contact with the Honduran authorities. As I said to the House yesterday, prior to the identification of Dunn by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>, the local authorities had not identified Mr Dunn, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10795"> nor had the AFP or New South Wales Police been able to follow up any further leads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does that take the matter? The fact of the matter is that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> spent considerable resources in looking for Mr Dunn, resources that were not available to the Honduran authorities. They acted properly in contacting the Honduran authorities as soon as they thought they had identified him. What was done was done in consultation with the authorities in Australia, principally the AFP, which did send an officer to Honduras in those circumstances. It was all done properly and I hope it will continue to be done properly and that the result will be that Mr Dunn will face trial in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General claims to take the matter seriously and then proceeds not to.

We do not prejudice the case; we do not seek to and we will not go to the merits of the case at all. But we will go to the merits of the government's action, as has the member for Banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen here the signal failure on the part of the government to expedite the extradition and arrest of Mr Robert `Dolly' Dunn. It is now clear that the government has failed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dismally in its responsibility to take all the necessary steps with an appropriate sense of urgency to extradite and arrest the alleged pederast, Mr Robert Dunn. I use the word `pederast' advisedly because the alleged offences against children have none of the loving character the word `paedophile' implies. I never used that. Sexual exploitation of children whenever it is alleged is a violent betrayal of the most vulnerable in our society.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, we have seen a comedy of errors culminating in Mr Dunn being initially confronted and tracked down by a current affairs program to provide infotainment, not by officers of the law through the proper channels reasonably available to the Australian government. People are entitled to ask why that is so. If it had not been for the whistleblowing by former ambassador Broinowski the government's ineptitude would still be hidden from the gaze of the Australian people. The Attorney&hyphen;General attempted to cover it up further today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have since been subjected to the unseemly image of the Prime Minister (Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10796"> Howard) and his senior ministers, including the Attorney&hyphen;General, passing the buck and denying either knowledge of or responsibility for the chaotic treatment of this very serious issue. But we have noticed. The Prime Minister wants us all to keep our mouths shut&mdash;a view apparently shared by the Attorney&hyphen;General&mdash;on the spurious grounds that criticising his government will somehow prejudice the prosecution of Mr Dunn. Far from it. This, from the same Prime Minister who has been prepared to stand idly by while Mr Dunn continued unperturbed in the Honduras with Australian justice unable to fully run its course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Mr Broinowski, the government has known for at least 11 months of the whereabouts of Mr Dunn. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) reluctantly confirmed yesterday, Mr Broinowski was asked to go to the Honduras explicit ly to determine their attitude to the possible extradition of Mr Dunn. It was not, as Senator Vanstone claimed, incidental to the ambassador's farewell tour of the region. As Broinowski put it in an interview with Gerald Tooth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, Foreign Affairs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">were interested in me doing this, and it was top of their agenda. And I must say it was on top of mine too.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At least initially. This was not a likely request if it was, as Senator Vanstone flippantly claimed, only one of a number of sightings and not worthy of concerted AFP action. That is what she was saying yesterday. To compound the grossness of her response, Senator Vanstone went on to compare the sightings of Dunn to those of Elvis Presley. The Prime Minister should remind the senator that, while Presley was a popular entertainer, Dunn's alleged activities hardly have that character, even to the sickest of minds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Broinowski's reports to the minister and the foreign affairs department initially failed to spark a response, as they did subsequently. He was so disturbed by this that he made further contact by phone and was told, `Well, we think we've got it'&mdash;a response which clearly alarmed the then ambassador. So to be `on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> safe side', as he put it, he sent his report for a second time. He needed to send it twice and also phone them. He concluded, and this is very important:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's no doubt that my report, with all my conversations had been received in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, what happened? Nothing. The ambassador heard nothing further about it before he left his post. It had, he said, `dropped into a hole'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When questioned yesterday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs disclaimed greater responsibility than acting as a postbox. He just received it and passed it on&mdash;nothing to do with him. He handballed the problem to the Attorney&hyphen;General, who claims that the `normal processes were followed'&mdash;as if this was not a matter of some urgency&mdash;using Interpol and the Honduran police and that there was no confirmation, according to the Attorney&hyphen;General yesterday and today, of Mr Dunn's whereabouts until the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> team found him. What a joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Broinowski is clear, however, that when the case first came to him there was a `very definite view that he was there'. This was not on spec; there was a very definite view that Mr Dunn was in Honduras. It seems probable that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> team received their tip&hyphen;off about the whereabouts of Mr Dunn from Australian police officers who were frustrated by the lack of government resolve and resources. That is why an inquiry is needed. There is no doubt in my mind that cuts to the Australian Federal Police have affected their ability to investigate and monitor alleged pederasts. The organisation now does not have a single full-time officer working on Operation Mandrake, the operation that monitors about 1,300 known offenders with a further 400 being added each year. For members' information, Operation Mandrake is currently staffed by two part&hyphen;time police officers and one part&hyphen;time staff member. As a result, the Commonwealth's commitment to the national fight against paedophilia is a joke, as has been said by our shadow Attorney&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also appears that the nearest AFP office in Washington only has a travel budget of $12,000. The Attorney&hyphen;General would have us 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10797"> believe that it is only television stations that can mount reasonable pursuit. Despite the excuses by the Attorney&hyphen;General and the Minster for Justice, it was, as former Ambassador Broinowski correctly states, perfectly possible, given the attitude of the Honduran government, for more direct action to be taken. They did not have to wait around for Interpol. The ex&hyphen;ambassador says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we were more determined about this, we could have, through me, through the embassy in Mexico, with instructions, have gone in with the police and found the man. There's no doubt about that, we could have done it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why wasn't it done? Like many of us, he expresses the bewilderment of the whole community about why there was no vigorous pursuit of this matter. To quote Mr Broinowski again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we have such moral outrage at this man and what he's alleged to have done, then I would have thought that something could have happened to speed up the process.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Broinowski is not the only one who thinks that. The government must now tell the Australian people, through a proper inquiry, why and how nothing was done about this matter for nearly a year; and then only as the result of the actions of a current affairs program. It is not sufficient for the Prime Minister to wring his hands in apparent moral outrage at the alleged perpetration, as he puts it, of this most appalling crime. We want action and we need answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that all of this reminds me of the cartoon characters Big Ears, Noddy and Mr Plod. The physical characteristics are not too dissimilar either. Big Ears, Noddy and Mr Plod: Vanstone, Downer and Williams. And Mr Plod could not even raise his own posse&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> had to do the job on their own. This is a disgrace from an incompetent government who are indifferent to this matter, who have shown themselves to be irresponsible and negligent in such an important matter of community concern.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, he ought to be a responsible member of parliament. All of us ought to be responsible members of parliament. This government did hear a report in February 1997 of the possibility of Mr Dunn's presence in Honduras. Although we heard of that possibility, confirmation was not obtained for some time. We did seek from the accredited diplomatic representative to Honduras details about the possible extradition from that country. The ambassador replied to us pointing out that he was not positive about the prospects of extradition, as distinct from Honduras merely expelling Dunn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite that, this government sent to Honduras a request for Mr Dunn's provisional arrest for extradition. But what happened was that he was expelled, not extradited, from Honduras, and he is now facing extradition proceedings in the United States. Mr Dunn has indicated that he will not come to Australia quietly, he will not consent to his extradition and he is not prepared to return to Australia voluntarily. His extradition hearing is set down in Miami for 6 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obvious that the accusations brought forward by the opposition might well obtain publicity in the United States and could undermine not only the chances of a fair trial in Australia but also the chances of extradition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Banks has ridden roughshod over conventions. He has not shown any sincere attempt to get to the bottom of this matter.

Mr Dunn is, however, entitled to justice and he is entitled to a presumption of innocence at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has sought to hide nothing. The government acted expeditiously when the first sightings were made of Mr Dunn in Honduras. We cannot send police officers to any place in the world where any individual may or may not have been sighted. What we have to do is to take every necessary action to verify the presence or otherwise of a person there. But, if indeed we were to send someone&mdash;say, police officials&mdash;to any part of the world at any time when someone may or may not have been sighted, our budgetary facilities obviously would soon be exhausted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, by sending the ambassador to Honduras to ascertain what the law was and to make inquiries, took appropriate action.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point about all this is that, if <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> could find Mr Dunn in Honduras, surely it is not beyond the wit of the Australian Federal Police, as directed, to have been able to locate Mr Dunn and tail him to make sure that he did not leave. I understand that there are difficulties in getting a process with a country that has no extradition treaty with Australia. I compliment the Attorney-General for the government's continued support for the importance of Australia's contribution to Interpol. As members would know, the government is supporting the candidature for the international executive of Interpol of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10800"> Australia's Federal Police Commissioner, Mr Palmer, which is a tremendous step forward for Australia's position vis-a-vis Interpol. As we know, Interpol is under some threat by the creation of regional police intelligence bodies, such as Europol and others, that are perhaps crossing over the role of Interpol and may result in a decline in the resources available to this important body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have called on Australia to beef up its contribution following the visit of the former Secretary-General of Interpol, Mr Kendall, to Australia last year. He called on Australia to take a much stronger role in our region in relation to Interpol's work, particularly as there is perhaps a lack of resources in the Pacific region, an area there have been some considerable concerns of money laundering, drug trafficking assistance and the rest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one thing to say that the process is under way, and former Ambassador Bruinowski has said that he was concerned that there appeared to be nothing going on. Clearly, that would cause concern to the Australian community in relation to this issue because the matter has attracted so much public comment with the recent Wood royal commission and other discussion in the public domain about matters relating to paedophile activity within Australia. Mr Dunn is entitled to a fair trial. He is entitled to a fair process. But what has been brought to the forefront is the problems that seem to be associated with the process, not only of identifying where the person is but of then bringing him to the process of Australian justice. Nobody in their right mind would want to see Mr Dunn's trial&mdash;unless somebody were being mischievous&mdash;thwarted or in any way perverted so that the matter could not be dealt with promptly and justly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the following observation. The member for Fisher alluded to this when he mentioned not being able to send Australian Federal Police to Honduras. He talked about resources. He would know, as a member of the government who has followed the tradition of the opposition in recent years of cutting back on the AFP's resources, that sworn federal agents are now at manning levels almost equivalent to pre-1984. I would say that is a matter of much more serious 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concern. I appreciate that the government, in response to considerable community clamour and the work of members who have brought these matters to the attention of the government, has responded to the drug problem by announcing an $84 million war against drugs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, whatever it is. There was some doubt originally about exactly how much it was. I commend the government for that. I am not for one  minute suggesting that that is not welcome as an addition to the armoury in law enforcement. But back in 1984, which is when the AFP's sworn agent levels were similar to the present situation, there was a problem. Justice Kirby in 1984 said quite prophetically:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until very recently, crime in Australia was virtually exclusively a State Police concern. But in the past decade there has been an increase in Federal involvement in the criminal law which can only be described as dramatic. In little more than a decade the volume of cases arising under the Federal Crimes Act has trebled. Within that time the authorised strength of the Force&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the AFP&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">only doubled.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was a cry of concern back in 1984 regarding the situation that had developed up to that point. Clearly, it has got worse. It has become a matter of serious concern. Now there is, in effect, a rate of sworn officers only equivalent to 1984. In the aftermath of the cuts that have occurred in the last two budgets, budget cuts that the government says were necessary because of the previous government's financial incompetence, the Labor Party shares guilt in this matter because it had been pursuing cuts in the federal law enforcement agencies up until the election of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to resources&mdash;the member for Fisher has acknowledged that maybe it was beyond the resources of the AFP to send AFP officers to tail Mr Dunn in Honduras; I am sure that would not have been an extremely difficult proposition to undertake&mdash;one would have assumed the AFP had the resources to find out exactly where Mr Dunn was so that he could not escape from the long arm of the law.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10801">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the minister: I would appreciate a briefing too so that I can inform my constituents why the government feels relaxed, or certainly not as concerned as the opposition, about the Dunn affair. I would certainly like to learn what has been undertaken in the period between Mr Dunn's original sighting and when he was expelled from Honduras and then apprehended in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, it is interesting that, when the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority was doing an inquiry into organised paedophile criminal networks, there was some evidence from World Vision which was considerably disturbing. The evidence was that World Vision was concerned that its donor scheme was being infiltrated by people who wanted to access children in their target countries for sexual purposes. World Vision said at the time that they got little response from the authorities when they made their complaints in the first instance, and they were surprised at what they saw as a lack of interest. The Australian Federal Police Association gave evidence to our committee that they were disappointed that no on&hyphen;site inquiries were done in Cambodia. There is a sense of deja vu&mdash;although it is a little different in this case&mdash;in the complaints that have arisen, and all I can hope is that, if a briefing is available, the actual process has not been in any way hindered by the lack of resources on the part of the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House insists on disagreeing to the amendments insisted on by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will make a few brief comments about the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996, and that is to say again that this is a landmark development in regard to the way in which elections will be conducted in the future. There is no doubt about that. The charter of budget honesty will change the way in which policies are implemented&mdash;it will give a basis on which elections can be fought with a much clearer understanding as to where the finances of the country are at. At this stage, we do have to reiterate for the Australian people that it was debated and discussed throughout the last election. The government of the day&mdash;the Labor Party&mdash;were saying that Australia's books were balanced, that everything was okay and that things had been paid for, but the fact is that when we opened up the books there was a $10,000 million debt. In other words, the Labor Party left this country putting everything on the bankcard. They were prepared to leave this debt there for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not the coalition that caused that debt, but the coalition has taken responsibility to bring the finances of this country back into shape and into order, and it has done that already. In other words, we are faced with a huge debt which the government of the day was not prepared to tell the Australian people about, and we have taken responsibility to sort that debt out so that future generations&mdash;our children and our grandchildren&mdash;will not have to cope with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This charter of budget honesty is about trying to prevent that ever happening again, because elections will have to be fought on well&hyphen;based financial information coming out of the Treasury if we get this legislation through. But, of course, the Labor Party are opposing opening up honesty in regard to the books of this country when it comes to an election. They want to keep it all hidden. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10803"> They are opposing the charter of budget honesty. I think we need to reflect on the fact that the federal government's debt was $16 billion when Prime Minister Keating came into power. When he left it was $93 billion&mdash;an enormous blow&hyphen;out of money by the previous Labor government. By using their numbers in the Senate, they are trying to defeat this legislation in the Senate so that they can continue that reckless approach to the financial management of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This charter of budget honesty is, as I said, a landmark approach to how we deal with debates during an election. I have to congratulate the Treasurer (Mr Costello) for his work in bringing this forward to the parliament because it will mean that, when the next election is held, the Australian people will know what the state of affairs is. That is quite distinct from the state of affairs at the last election. When we were told that the books were balanced, they were not. Next time we hold an election, the Australian people will know the basis on which the financial circumstances of this country rests. It will be clear, it will be open and the Australian people will be able to judge much more carefully and more fully the merits of both the opposition and the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is beyond belief that the Labor Party would want to keep things secret from the Australian people. This is a charter of budget honesty. They are opposing it, the Democrats are opposing it and other senators in the Senate are opposing it, yet this is about opening up the books so that the Australian people know what the circumstances are. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact that the government is not prepared to accept the Senate amendments reveals the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R425">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996</XREF>  for the sham, the fraud and the stunt that it is. Let us look at some of the provisions of the bill and see why this is so. In the first place, the government has rejected the proposition in the Senate that the charter ought to be legally binding. We are left with an optional charter of budget honesty. What happens if the government does not follow the charter of budget honesty? Nothing. Is this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> going to make governments more honest? Not at all.  It is an absolute sham, an absolute fraud, an attempt to deceive the Australian people. It is a load of old cobblers&mdash;simply a political stunt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there is no estimate of the effect on national savings of the provisions to be set out in this charter of budget honesty. You would think that it is a fundamental objective of budget policy that we increase the level of national savings. That was the second thing that the government would not support in the Senate. Indeed, the government got the support of the Greens senator, Senator Margetts, who I dare say thinks that national savings is a matter of economic rationalism and therefore should not be supported. What an unholy alliance!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government was not fair dinkum about increasing the level of national savings, just as it has not been fair dinkum about increasing the level of national savings in its attacks on superannuation, in the 15 per cent superannuation surcharge, in reducing Labor's proposal for 15 per cent retirement incomes through the superannuation guarantee, in its opting out provision and its `choice of funds' proposal. All of these things show that it has no commitment to national savings. When we put forward in the Senate that the charter of budget honesty ought to have some commitment to national savings, it would not support that either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the specific amendments that are the subject of disagreement between the government and the position in the Senate. The Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) said that we are opposing this bill and we are opposing the charter. This is completely untrue. The parliamentary secretary has misled the House in relation to this. We have not opposed the bill at all. We voted for the bill in both the House and the Senate. In refusing to support these amendments, the government is running dead. If you think that the charter of budget honesty is so important and so worth while, support these amendments and get the bill through the House and through the Senate. The government is running dead; it does not want to see 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10804"> the charter of budget honesty implemented at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the areas of disagreement. The first amendment proposes that the principles of sound fiscal management to which the bill refers should include the achievement of full employment. The government come back and say, `No, we don't want that in a charter of budget honesty. We don't want to have a commitment to full employment.' Like everything else they have done in relation to this issue, their refusal to set the objective of full employment for the Reserve Bank, their refusal to set any targets for employment and unemployment and their miserable lack of action in relation to employment&mdash;it is a national scandal, a national disgrace that unemployment has risen during their period in office, with the number of long&hyphen;term unemployed rising&mdash;reflects the fact that we need to have a commitment to full employment amongst the principles of sound fiscal management. Is that an attempt to scuttle the charter of budget honesty? Not at all. It is an attempt to improve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second amendment requires the Commissioner of Taxation and the Secretary to the Treasury to provide a report on any material threats to the integrity of the taxation system. We say that there is a need to protect the revenue and to maintain the current tax base. The government says, `Oh, the tax base is in a state of disrepair,' so we are all going to have to have a GST and pay taxes on food and many other essentials that previously we have not had to pay because the tax base is in a state of disrepair. Is it not reasonable against that background that the Commissioner of Taxation and the Secretary to the Treasury provide reports on things which threaten the tax base?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is saying in refusing to accept this amendment is, `We like the secrecy. We like the present arrangement where these things are reported to the Treasurer but he doesn't have to act on them and he doesn't have to tell the public that he has received reports on those matters.' If we are talking about budget honesty, we should not be supporting this kind of secrecy. The second amendment is one which would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> improve and enhance the charter of budget honesty and make it a fair dinkum charter of budget honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, we have seen the family trusts tax rort which the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has allowed to continue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The Treasurer made an announcement on 13 May this year, embraced in legislation which we debated in the House subsequently, allowing for the continuation of an exemption for injections of income by non-beneficiaries in family trusts, enabling them to, in effect, traffic in trust losses and pay no tax on income derived by them in completely separate circumstances from those relating to the trust itself. That is an extraordinary and indefensible example of tax avoidance and a loophole which has been left open by the Treasurer. That sort of thing went manifestly against the advice of the Treasury and the tax office. We note that it may well have something to do with the fact that up to 19 members of the government's frontbench do have family trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course it will be the case that future treasurers will still be able to refuse to act on the advice of their revenue authorities, but they will not be able to hide their action or their lack of action. They will not be able to hide the nature of that advice and the fact that they are not complying with that advice. They will not be able to hide that from the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are serious about a charter of budget honesty, that is precisely the kind of provision that ought to be in it; that is precisely the kind of provision that the Labor opposition has put forward. If the government were fair dinkum about this charter of budget honesty, they would be supporting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area of disagreement between the Senate and us relates to intergenerational reporting. The amendment proposed by the Senate would change the frequency of the proposed intergenerational fiscal reports from five years back to three years. That was moved by the Democrats, and it ensures that there will be a report during each normal parliament. Parliament customarily serves for three years so, in  the life of each parliament, we would get one intergenerational fiscal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10805"> report. We think that that is a reasonable proposition, and it is eminently reasonable for the Senate to insist on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments Nos 4 and 5 relate to the pre&hyphen;election economic and fiscal outlook report which the legislation proposes to require. Amendment No. 4 proposes that, instead of waiting until an election is called, reports be published in the normal way two years and nine months after the first day of sitting of a new parliament. We argue in our amendment that, if an election is called prior to that time, the report should be produced not within 10 days but five. We do not want to see a system set up in such a way as to enable this kind of report to be used as a political tactic by the government of the day during an election campaign period simply to advance its own agenda. Obviously, the later such a report is released the less real campaign time or real opportunity oppositions have to respond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would not be good enough to have the opposition, other non&hyphen;government parties and Independent members being denied a reasonable time in which to respond to the issues and possibly adjust policy in light of the issues that such a report would raise. We have concerns and have moved amendments concerning the nature of the outlook report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 5 proposes to ensure beyond doubt that ministers be forbidden from participating in the preparation of a pre&hyphen;election economic and fiscal outlook report. This bill suggests that what is required with a charter of budget honesty is not a political document but a genuinely objective assessment by capable bureaucracy of the economic outlook. If that is what the government is proposing, if it is genuine about a charter of budget honesty, then why would it reject making that clear in a bipartisan way by agreeing to this amendment? The government, in opposing this amendment, is making clear to the parliament and the public that it supports the possibility of political interference. Once again, that is utterly at odds with the concept of a charter of budget honesty and the purported function of this bill in improving the quality of government in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments Nos 6 and 7 raise major concerns with what this legislation is really 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all about. (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Extension of time granted</EMPHASIS>) These amendments are concerned with requests about the costing of election commitments&mdash;whether the legislation is really about improving the quality of public administration and democratic debate in this country or simply about giving partisan political advantage to the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what the government have done in framing these provisions in part 8 concerning the proposed costing regime. The government pretend that they are improving access to the costing resources of the bureaucracy&mdash;the economic departments&mdash;when in fact they are endeavouring to perpetrate a sting on the opposition. The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill says that only publicly announced policies can be costed. That is to say, the opposition has to formally announce its policy before it is entitled to get a cost estimate from the bureaucracy during the caretaker period. There is no provision to get costing advice earlier than during the caretaker period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be that official costing indicates that the financial impact of a policy is considerably different from that which any opposition had assumed. Even the most competent opposition with the resources available to it finds it very difficult to produce estimates of financial and economic impact with the same kind of precision that is possible for a bureaucracy. That is simply day to day reality. The government and the opposition both depend on publicly funded resources. No&hyphen;one could seriously argue&mdash;least of all, us&mdash;that the opposition should get an equal share of them. In the nature of things, it is simply not reasonable to force an opposition to publicly announce a policy when the precise fiscal implications of it are a matter of uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further political dynamic is that if the opposition has publicly announced its policies, the mere existence of this particular clause in the legislation will create&mdash;and I am sure is designed to create&mdash;a source of political pressure for the opposition to seek a costing for it from the bureaucracy. No&hyphen;one will be able to be sure of the outcome of that costing or the political consequences of a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10806"> costing that does not conform to the opposition's own estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am absolutely sure that the government has deliberately crafted this legislation to try to produce that effect. If that is not the deliberate intention, if the government is serious about this being a piece of legislation which will improve the overall quality of public administration, democratic debate and government accountability, then it would not be creating a legislative regime which has these kinds of in&hyphen;built traps for the opposition of the day. We happen to be the opposition at the moment but, based on some recent data, that may not be for long. In due course, the coalition will find itself in exactly this situation and will understand that this is inherently unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government are not in the same situation. They are able to refine to their heart's content proposed policies, with the assistance of costing advice from the departments concerned, without any suggestion that these policies might have to be publicly announced. So they can go through and test them against various models and cost them without being forced, as they would force the opposition, to publicly announce them. Clearly, even if we are talking about the caretaker period, any government, even one lacking in competence, would have these tasks catered for and accomplished by the time that it called the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Our amendments, which the Senate has supported, simply seek to inject some equity and fairness into matters of costing. Amendment No. 8 goes to the question of pre-election costings as well. It seeks to remove from the Prime Minister the discretion in the present bill to decline a request from the opposition for a costing to be made by the relevant departmental secretary and to eliminate the proposal in the original bill that the Prime Minister should be given a copy of the opposition policies concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If we are talking about budget honesty, we say it is entirely inappropriate that the government, through the Prime Minister, should have a discretion on whether opposition policy costings are in fact to proceed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> If this is about budget 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> honesty, we think that the matter should be free of government interference, free of the perception of political interference and in the interests of proper, open, national debate. It should not be a question about what suits the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise that there are some formalities to be observed and that access to economic department secretaries is still via request to the Prime Minister. But we do not support, and the amendment does not support, the requirement that the Prime Minister be provided with a copy of the policies to be costed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Amendment No. 9 adds subclauses which would grant the responsible secretaries a discretion to decline to provide advice where this would include policy advice. I think that demonstrates pretty clearly the opposition's good faith on these matters. We are not proposing that we should be able to get policy advice on the sly or under the guise of costing advice. We understand that it would be inappropriate for policy advice to be provided to the opposition in that way. So that is a further amendment that we have put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, amendment No. 10 talks about how policy costings ought to be prepared, requiring that the assumptions upon which costings have been made be spelled out when a costing is provided. That simply represents an improvement in the transparency of the costings process. Once again, if we are talking about budget honesty, the assumptions on which costings are made ought to be spelt out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary talked about the $10 billion black hole. That is all in the assumptions. That is all in the changed assumptions which the government made regarding the budget once it came to office. So we regard it as important that these assumptions be made public so everyone can see how a policy has been costed, not merely what the cost of it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If the government are serious about getting the bill through&mdash;I very much doubt they are; I think they are looking for a political stunt, not a bill that gets through the parliament&mdash;they will support these amendments which are genuine charter of budget honesty amendments. They are not designed to scuttle the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10807"> bill but to make it a fair dinkum charter of budget honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that this is not the only example of the government being more interested in the political advantage rather than the legislative solution. In the last couple of days government members have expressed concern about the government's hardline position on the Wik legislation&mdash;its refusal to accept amendments in the Senate&mdash;and it is becoming increasingly clear that the government is interested in the partisan, grubby, political aspects of this rather than the national public interest solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) has told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> that he is worried about the government's hard line against amendments, saying that the Senate should not be disregarded in a democratic system. Mr Bradford said he was concerned about the public perception that the Wik legislation was damaging the reconciliation process and that the prospect of a double dissolution was horrendous.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few brief comments, particularly on the legally binding aspect which has been raised in debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R425">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996</XREF> . It is the assumption that the Labor Party wants to have something that is legally binding in regard to taxation measures, budget honesty and openness. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to remind the House that the previous government in 1993 said, `Yes, we'll make it legally binding. We'll make the overall taxation burden less&mdash;$14 billion in tax cuts&mdash;and we'll put it into law.' We put that legislation through the parliament. They told us that these taxes were legally binding. They said, `Yes, these tax cuts are coming&mdash;$14 billion worth of them.' That is what Prime Minister Keating said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party are in here today talking about making something legally binding. Why would you trust them? They will do anything. `Whatever it takes' I think was the saying of former Senator Richardson, wasn't it? Yes, it was. They promised legally binding tax cuts of $14 billion, and what did they do to the Australian people? They put on a tax hike of $13.4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They increased the Medicare levy, they increased tax on motor vehicles, they increased company tax, they increased tobacco tax and they increased PAYE tax payments&mdash;and in here today they are whingeing about the fact that this legislation about budget honesty is not legally binding. Let us get to the heart of the matter. The essence of this is to ensure that the Australian people, come the next election and future elections, will have the information on which to judge both sides. They will be able to judge the policies and the public commitments financially at the next election. This is about openness, transparency and honesty in regard to the budget. We did not have it at the last election; we are going to prevent that situation in the future. This is a landmark piece of legislation. I commend this motion to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prime Minister, we do not live in the same world that you do. We happen to live in the real world. We accept that the current array of income support for young people is complex and in need of reform. In fact, we welcome some of the aspects of the bill. But the improvements come at a price, to be paid, unfortunately, by 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who have not finished year 12 and who are looking for work, and by 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who are unable to find work. Their families will also be paying that price. I do not find this acceptable at all and neither do the vast range of people in my community with whom I hold conversations about this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the government speakers I have heard today on this bill have been boasting that there is protection for some young people in this bill; for instance, if a family cannot afford to support them financially. I would point out that the parental income test clicks in at $23,350 per annum. It is not exactly a king's ransom, is it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is saying that the removal of benefits to 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds sends a clear message to them that the best way to get a job is to stay at school. This statement implies that 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who leave school early do so as a deliberate, considered 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10811"> and rational choice to gain short&hyphen;term dollars. It flies in the face of the reality, demonstrated by research, that these people leave school early for other reasons. They leave because of family or emotional difficulties or social disadvantage, or because they are not suited to the school environment. The reasons why they leave school early are the very reasons they need that extra support, including income support, rather than the extra pressure that this government is now planning to put on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Removal of payments will not address the causes of the problem. Many people forced off unemployment payments are likely to turn to crime and other sources of income rather than go back into the classroom. The government is creating a pressure cooker situation for some of these young people. It is no good blaming the victims of the disappearance of entry level jobs for the fact that these jobs no longer exist. It is a fact that not every young person currently has the capacity for, or is suited to, staying on at school for years 11 and 12.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many young people need counselling support from qualified psychologists, available in and through the school, to address their family and emotional difficulties and to encourage them to remain at school&mdash;to give them reasons they can accept for remaining at school. They need proper work oriented careers education when they are at school. They need expanded work experience opportunities while there. They also need expanded school to work transition programs which create pathways for them to enter the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Expansion of existing programs should occur along the lines of the jobs pathway guarantee program, which was introduced by Labor in 1995 and piloted in schools located in the regions of highest youth unemployment and which was earmarked for expansion prior to the last election. The Howard government has revamped this program as the jobs pathway program and expanded it slightly. However, this funding increase and the other school to work funding initiatives undertaken by the Howard government, such as more money for vocational education and training in schools, and school based apprenticeships, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have been completely negated by other actions of the government. These include the chopping of 117,000 places in labour market programs for young people and the decline of case management for the young unemployed under the new and, I am afraid to say, chaotic employment services market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Early school leaving is intimately connected with homelessness among young people. Therefore, the level of resources for the job placement employment and training program, or JPET, which aims to help young people overcome problems preventing them from maintaining stable accommodation and entering into full&hyphen;time education training and employment, simply must be considered as part of this debate. What was formerly called the young homeless allowance and other relevant social security payments must be considered. General community back&hyphen;up measures to tackle the underlying problems of youth homelessness and family breakdown should also be part of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look for just a moment at what we are talking about when we refer to the withdrawing of income support for 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who leave education without completing year 12. In this legislation, under proposed subsection 543A of the bill, 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who are not in education and who have left school without finishing year 12 or who have not been exempted from this requirement by the secretary will not qualify for an income support payment. As a consequence, they will not qualify for any of the education, labour market assistance or other programs which might assist their transition from school to the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that under subsection 543A(2) these young people may qualify for a youth allowance in some circumstances. The Department of Social Security provided some indication to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee in its recent inquiry into this issue of what these circumstances might be&mdash;I say `might'&mdash;for example, homelessness, family violence or abuse, no education place available and so on. But I also understand that the guidelines under which this will operate are not much further advanced, if at all, than in the original submission to that inquiry. I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10812"> pose the questions: how will the exemptions work? What will be the final list of acceptable exemptions? What evidence will the young person involved need to provide to receive exemption? How will they gather that evidence? There are a lot of questions surrounding exemption  when we look at the legislation in relation to youth allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I imagine that if a young person is in a position where exemption may apply they would already be in a situation of extreme stress. This government intends to increase that stress by expecting&mdash;we are not, at this stage, quite sure what&mdash;that that young person will somehow deal themselves out of it by providing evidence for exemption clauses, none of which we are quite certain about at this stage. I find this appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the current climate of youth unemployment, access to education and the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day pressures that our young people are facing, we should not be considering putting a young person and their family under more pressure than they are already facing. I am afraid that, whatever comments come from the other side in this place, I am not convinced that putting these young people in this position is a good, positive and constructive thing for them or their family. The situation is just appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has already done terrible things, such as saving $90 million by reducing the number of children who can qualify for child disability allowance&mdash;in another piece of legislation, admittedly. The whole theory of this government is to save money. We do not know what the projected savings of this whole piece of legislation are; they have not been made known. I cannot for one moment imagine that there will not be savings attached to this. There is not one thing that this government does that does not have a savings motive. But we do not know what the savings are; the government has not confessed to the level of savings measures. I wonder what our poor young people will be doing in the meantime to survive in the real world&mdash;not the Howard world&mdash;facing the pressures that exist each day. I do not know how they are going to get through this and survive well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that Labor wants to see young Australians off welfare&mdash;we have no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> question about that&mdash;but not in the way being proposed by the Howard government with its common youth allowance. To abolish unemployment benefits for 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds whilst also slashing educational opportunities is the wrong way to even begin to imagine how to reform the welfare state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the income test being placed upon families with 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, members opposite made the comment earlier in this debate, `Don't worry, if families can't financially afford to support them then that will be okay.' That income test begins to come into effect at $23,350. That is pretty drastic&mdash;an 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;old who is somehow trying to make their way in life having to go cap in hand to a financially stretched family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know about your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, but I know that in my electorate there are an enormously unacceptable number of families who are financially strapped. They are finding it very difficult. The economy and security around those families is very tenuous. In my electorate and in the ACT at large the number of people who, if they are in employment, have no future job security at all is far too high. They have fairly pessimistic views towards their ability to gain employment in the future should they be unemployed right now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth unemployment in this town is very high. It bounces between 30 and 50 per cent. It has not been up to 50 per cent for a few months but it is bouncing around 30 to 40 per cent consistently. And what do we see? We see the government say to these young people, `If you do not want to stay at school, we are going to force you to. If you need financial assistance to survive, you go to your family. We are not interested in the circumstances of your family. We do not want to know whether there are reasons why it may be difficult for you to do that. We do not care whether you believe that your family may already be facing financial stress. We are just going to withdraw that support, immediately. We are going to save money. We are not yet telling how much. In the meantime, you get back to school. You'll be happy during it and you'll be successful at the end of it.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10813">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I deplore the government for their actions on the youth allowance. As I have said, there are some clauses of this bill that we welcome, there is no doubt about that, and we are on record as saying so. But I deplore the major thrust of this bill: the withdrawing of financial support for those aged 16 to 20 in our community. I condemn the government for it and I predict very strongly that it is going to come back to bite them on the tail in the not too distant future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997</XREF>  is yet another example of this government's good policy and of the much needed reform that only a coalition government is prepared to embark on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came into government we had to deal with the most horrific fiscal situation left to us by our Labor predecessors. I do not have to remind people&mdash;but I will anyway&mdash;of just how horrendous that $10.3 billion deficit, which was supposed to be a surplus, was. It is not chicken feed; it is not $10 it is $10.3 billion. We were confronted not only with the horrific fiscal situation but also with a particular culture in the social welfare area that had got progressively worse over the previous 13 years. The genesis of this culture can be traced back to the Whitlam years in government. This culture of dependency on the state, of not accepting your responsibilities, is part of the reason we have seen the share of the federal budget spent on social security rise from about 20 per cent nine years ago to over 30 per cent today. What that means is that a smaller percentage of Australians are increasingly having to pay for everyone else. That cannot go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's answer was to just keep on spending, putting it on the bankcard, putting it on the never&hyphen;never, for the future generations to pick up the tab. We are taking a very different course. Through good fiscal management, we will turn that $10.3 billion loss into a profit within three years. This is producing a solid foundation for growth, which we are now starting to see is translating into investor confidence and wealth creation and therefore jobs; that is the only way you will create real jobs. We are providing some real hope for our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> young people, not the false hope we  have witnessed during particularly the Keating years of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Speaking of hope, I have returned only half an hour ago from attending a very sad affair, a memorial service for the two schoolgirls who were murdered in Bega just recently. Probably the positive thing that came out of what was a very sad few hours for many of us in the community of Bega was that people talked about hope and hope for our young. They could see that things are changing and that there is hope and that there is great confidence in our young people, who were there in force at that particular service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me come back to the legislation, and in particular the contribution of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who moved an amendment. It is interesting that I mentioned the Whitlam years being the genesis of this welfare dependency culture, seeing that is where the member for Werriwa got his political training. The member for Werriwa said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The welfare state needs reforming.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At least he admits that Labor created a welfare state. It is nothing to be proud of, though, I might say. Then he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to move from a residual system of income support to whole&hyphen;of&hyphen;life support. We need to move from passive to active systems of welfare . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not really sure what all that means. I hope it does not mean that he wants government to actively provide whole&hyphen;of&hyphen;life welfare support for all and sundry. But maybe he does. It seems to fit with Labor's actions of the late 1980s and early 1990s where they actively&mdash;I say `actively', remembering the recession we had to have&mdash;brought people onto welfare dependency. However, perhaps I am too tough on the member for Werriwa, because he does go on to talk about encouraging risk and rewarding effort as well as improving skills. Looking positive, isn't it? He must have read some of our literature, because risk and reward are not words you would usually find in Labor Party rhetoric. This might be new Labor, although there seem to be a few versions of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving a bit further along, the member for Werriwa also gives an interesting insight into how he saw society in the 1960s and 1970s, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10814"> and probably therefore how he sees things now and for the future. The interesting quote about the 1960s and 1970s is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A young male would probably aspire to the career path that his father held.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is certainly not how I saw those years. In fact, the mums and dads of that era were a generation who wanted their children to have something better than they themselves had. That certainly was the case in my family. I know my father did not want to see me starting work at 4 a.m. at the fruit and vegetable markets in Sydney as he did throughout his working life. No, that generation wanted a better education and better employment opportunities for their children, and they got it. It is very different from the 1980s and 1990s, where for the first time in many generations we saw a generation that was not handing on a better standard of living and more opportunities to their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa does talk about choice. He talks about broadening educational opportunities and catering for diversity. I support that, because that is the area that we have been moving towards since we came into government, and the proof of the pudding is in the eating. It is interesting that the word `incentive' is used at various times not only by the member for Werriwa but by other members who have spoken in this debate on this particular bill. But it seems that it has a variety of definitions. Part of the problem that we inherited, that culture that I talked about before, was the fact that there was an incentive there for young people to drop out of school and go on the dole. It was so easy to do. There were rent assistance and all sorts of things virtually thrown at them. The number of people in various communities that will attest to that is quite incredible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see incentive in a different way. We see incentive as something that must be more positive, not a negative. But it has been used as a negative for far too long, and I want to see that work the other way. Certainly many of the things that we are doing in education and training are providing that incentive in a positive way. I do not think it is such a bad thing that if a 16&hyphen; or 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old is not in school, not in education or training or not in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employment, that it should be their parents' responsibility to be looking after them. That is what we are saying in this particular bill. But currently a 16&hyphen; or 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old living in a family situation which can quite easily support him or her, can drop out of school, walk down the street, get on the dole and get all sorts of assistance. All that has done has been to add to the number of family break&hyphen;ups that have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course there will be exceptions to the rule. But there are safeguards in this bill that will pick those people up. It is possible to have 16&hyphen; and 17-year-olds receiving assistance in circumstances where it is really necessary. But there should not be an incentive there for 16&hyphen; and 17-year-olds to walk out of home, walk out of school, simply because they can get a whole heap of money from the welfare system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One aspect of this bill that I particularly want to speak on is assistance to rural students. As my electorate is predominantly a rural electorate, except for the area of Queanbeyan, it does not have the universities which are taken for granted by people in the big cities: `Which university will you go to? Will it be Sydney or New South Wales or Macquarie? Which particular type of vocational education course will do you?' There are enormous opportunities for people in cities which do not exist for people in rural areas. So many people who live in rural areas are required to move away from home to continue their study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the changes that we propose with this youth allowance, those rural students will be the ones to benefit greatly from the changes. For those students, Austudy disappears and they come into the youth allowance. But they will be eligible for rent assistance. I will give an example of how this will help a family living in rural and regional Australia. Fred is a 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old student living in Cooma, Bega, Batemans Bay, Moruya or Narooma&mdash;it could be any of those towns. He is enrolled in a full&hyphen;time TAFE  course in Sydney and has found a house to share, costing him $80 a week. Under Austudy, he could get up to $240.07 a fortnight. But under the new youth allowance, with the new rate for under&hyphen;18s 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10815"> living away from home, he can get up to $265.50 a fortnight; also, because such students will be eligible now for rent assistance, he can get the sum of $49.80 for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was a great inequity which existed previously. Many of my families in rural areas would say to me, `It's okay for those kids in the cities whose parents are on reasonable sorts of incomes'&mdash;and they could even be on similar sorts of incomes to those of rural people, but usually those in rural areas survive on something less&mdash;`it's all right for them, their kids can live at home, they can travel on the bus to university or TAFE, or whatever the course is, and back home again; it's an enormous saving for them to be able to do that. But our children can't.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inclusion of rent assistance for those students from rural areas means greater scope for them, greater opportunities to make that decision to travel to the city to attend university or TAFE. I think that is an aspect of this particular bill which will be very well received right throughout Eden-Monaro and many other rural and regional seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish with some comments on the contribution made by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). In concluding her contribution, she made the charge that the government does nothing on the employment side&mdash;nothing to get them a job. When you listen to that sort of contribution, and many of the other contributions by those opposite, there seems to be this assumption that government can provide all: at the drop of a hat, any old time, you do not have to worry about where the money comes from; you just keep providing it. There is also another assumption that those on the other side seem to make: the only jobs that get created in this economy are the jobs that are paid for by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A good example of that occurred under the former government where they talked about the so-called many hundreds of thousands of jobs that they or the so-called Working Nation created. But let us delve into what equalled the creation of a job: if somebody was placed on one of those three-month labour market programs, that was the creation of a job. If they then went off that three-month or six-month course and had a break 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for a while, and were then shunted into yet another one of those courses, that equalled the creation of another job. They were not jobs. That is not creating jobs. That is playing with numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People opposite need to understand that the only way you will create long&hyphen;term jobs is by having some wealth creation, someone making a profit, someone willing to use some of that profit to invest in something new, take a risk, `risk and reward' as mentioned by the member for Werriwa&mdash;and we will have to keep reminding him of that; it is a good phrase that those on the other side should use more often. That is the only way you will be able to create proper long&hyphen;term jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proper long&hyphen;term jobs will not be created by the government writing out a cheque for a program that lasts three or six months, and then saying, `That's a job created.' What a load of rubbish. It is just an interim place to park somebody. Basically, all of these so-called jobs that were created were parking lots which were established to stick people into for a period of time. That was not the creation of jobs&mdash;because those jobs were not and are not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I take some offence at the honourable member for Jagajaga saying that we on this side are doing nothing for employment. What we have done in the fiscal area in the short time that we have been here is remarkable. At a chamber of commerce meeting recently in Bateman's Bay I made the comment that the situation we took over when we came to government would be like somebody going out and saying: `There is a business for sale. That business turns over about $1.3 million a year, and has done for the last five years. But that business has made a loss of over $120,000 a year for every one of those five years.' If you were looking at buying a business and that was its record, you probably would not buy it. Anyway, we bought it because we got elected to government. We bought this business, or the equivalent thereof, that had been turning over about $1.3 million a year but with a loss of over $120,000. We have turned that loss around to a profit in the third year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10816">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody who has had anything to do with business&mdash;I know there are not too many on the other side&mdash;would know that it is a remarkable achievement to turn a small business that is losing over $120,000 a year into a profit venture in three years. That is what we have done and that is what is going to create employment. It has given us very sound foundations in Australia. The evidence is all over the place that the rest of the world is praising us for the solid foundations we are creating through the changes we have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business investment is skyrocketing. Anticipated business investment over the next few years is on a very steep, climbing graph. That will create the real jobs. We are putting our efforts into training people before they fall into unemployment. We have put an enormous effort into the apprenticeship schemes, the school apprenticeship schemes, the school to work schemes. We want people to come out of school ready and able to work, with the necessary skills. That, combined with the business investment that we see coming around the corner, will put these people into real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a very good bill. It is the right way to go. It takes away the incentive for young people to fall out of the family unit, to fall out of school, to fall out of education and training and go on the dole, but the safeguards are there to look after the people who really need to be looked after.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong, (Mr Howard) must cringe every time he thinks about the ease with which he won the last federal election. You would think he would be happy about it. You would think 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he would be delighted to have had such a large victory. But I do not think he is. Not only has it delivered for him an unmanageably large and unruly back bench&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8K6">Mr FITZGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. I thank my honourable colleague for interjecting. We had a 10-point plan once upon a time that wasn't too bad, but things seem to have changed with a little agitation from the government back bench. It must cause him to wonder, following that large election win, why he made so many promises, why he raised community expectations so high, why he promised the world. Members will recall that prior to the last election the world, according to the member for Bennelong, was one in which the sky was falling. Everything was a disaster and it was all Paul Keating's fault. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> More importantly, John Howard was going to fix the lot. He must now wonder how things might have been if only he had taken a more responsible approach to electioneering. But he wanted it so badly. He knew he would only get one chance and he was fed up with life in opposition after 13 long years. So what did he do? He promised the world. He undid years of hard work by members on both sides in this place in terms of selling the hard decisions Australian governments needed to make in the face of globalisation&mdash;things like tariff reform, financial deregulation, competition policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But his worst crime was his over-simplification of the unemployment problem, the problem the now Prime Minister was going to fix overnight. Members will recall that the member for Bennelong and the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), now the responsible minister in this area of public policy, travelled the length and breadth of the country prior to the election bleating about unemployment and, in particular, youth unemployment&mdash;it was a crisis. With respect to youth unemployment they exploited that silly method, as I see it, of measuring youth unemployment that takes no account of the fact that the overwhelming majority of 15- to 18-year-olds are in some form of schooling or training and, therefore, are not part of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10817"> labour force. This gives us an inflated base figure and an inflated youth unemployment rate in percentage terms. But there they were, Chicken Little and his mate. `The sky is falling', they were crying, `so you had better follow me.'  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community expectations were very high by the time the Prime Minister took office. But what has he done on the unemployment front? What is the government's record? Generally speaking, unemployment has gone up, both in terms of the overall rate and the youth unemployment rate. That is one of the reasons the Prime Minister has slumped so badly in the opinion polls. That is one of the reasons he has managed to reduce what was about a 10&hyphen;point lead to about a four&hyphen;point deficit. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997  is another reason for that slump.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new youth allowance will replace a number of existing benefits for younger Australians. It replaces Austudy for 16&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, newstart allowance for 16&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, youth training allowance for 16&hyphen; to 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, sickness allowance for 16&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year olds and the more than minimum rate of family payment for secondary students aged 16 to 18 not receiving Austudy. The rationalisation of the payments, as so many speakers on this side have already said, is welcomed by us. But what the changes basically mean&mdash;and this is my greatest concern&mdash;is that parents will now be financially responsible for their children until they reach the age of 21, whether they live at home or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are almost 30,000 young Australians aged 15, 16 and 17 and almost 100,000 people aged 18, 19 and 20 receiving an unemployment benefit of some sort. These figures are, of course, unacceptably high and, as a result of the changes announced, more than 30,000 of them will have their benefits reduced and another 14,000 or so will lose their $147 per fortnight benefit entirely because of the parental income test. The benefit will start to cut out when parental income exceeds $23,350 each year. What an appalling level! It reminds us of the nursing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> home assets test, Madam Deputy Speaker, doesn't it? It rings a bell indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the most curious measure of all is the one that dictates that 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds will be eligible for the new youth allowance only if they are in full&hyphen;time study, if they are studying part&hyphen;time while also looking for work or if they have completed year 12. Given the fact that more than 60,000 young people in Australia missed out on a TAFE place last year, what is to become of all those who cannot get into education, particularly when the government has made no additional commitment to host those students who will be forced back into school education?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely we do not want all young Australians to go on to sit for the higher school certificate. High school classes are already overflowing because there are so many students attending who do not really want to be there but do not have much choice. The new rules will exacerbate the problem at a time when the government is cutting education funding. The desire to improve the skills of our young people is an honourable one but, in the absence of a commitment to additional funding for education and training programs, it certainly rings hollow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, under the guidelines of the new service delivery agencies, which basically replace the CES, to receive labour market assistance and training, young people must be in receipt of some sort of benefit. So it now appears that those who do not quality for benefits, either because of the parental income test or because they are less than 18 and do not fit into one of the categories I mentioned earlier, will be denied access to training programs. Of course, the thousands of youth who will lose their benefits will drop off the unemployment list and, therefore, no doubt, the government will be making a claim or boasting about a drop in the youth unemployment rate. But let me share with the House the direct impact that this bill will have on my electorate. More than 200&hyphen;odd students will be forced back to school in the lower Hunter area alone&mdash;the lower half of my electorate. These are working&hyphen;class areas where average family incomes are much lower than the national average.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10818">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the election of the Howard government, we have seen so many pieces of bad public policy driven by an obsession with the budget bottom line. The government has been at pains to point out that the particular measures contained within this bill will not result in savings for the government. This bill is driven by something worse than a fixation with the budget bottom line. The motivation behind this bill, just like the work for the dole proposal, is driven by opinion polls and with a particular eye on the lagging results for the Prime Minister in those opinion polls of recent weeks. It is an attempt to capitalise on a view in the community that there exists too great an incentive not to work in this country. But I ask: is this an informed view; and, if not, are governments elected to make informed decisions for the benefit of the country or to blindly pursue popular causes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister wants things to be just like they used to be. He wants to take us back rather than forward. But the world has changed and, as a nation, we cannot afford to sit back and be relaxed and comfortable. John Howard obviously remembers with great fondness the days when young people could leave school early and walk into a job, but they were largely unskilled jobs that simply do not exist any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side will support any properly considered policy to encourage greater rates of school retention and further education and training. We did that pretty well in government, taking year 12 retention rates from one&hyphen;third in the early 1980s to around two&hyphen;thirds by the early 1990s. But this bill is not worthy of such support. This is the big stick approach. Its message for young Australians is: stay at school regardless of your intellectual capacity or regardless of any adverse family or social circumstances you may find yourself in, or go and get a job. As if the jobs are out there! Indeed, as a result of so many of the policies of this government, there are fewer jobs out there now than there were at the time that they came to government. It is an unrealistic demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course this bill is discriminatory. It discriminates against those regions where family incomes are low and job opportunities 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are almost non-existent. The 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds lucky enough to have a family to support them will get by okay. Those who do not will not be so lucky. Many of them live in my own electorate. In Cessnock more than 73 per cent of students leave school by the age of 16. The New South Wales average is just 55 per cent. But forcing them to do the New South Wales HSC will not change the value they place on the HSC. There will be a total of 363 of them in my electorate. As I mentioned earlier, 298 of them live in the lower Hunter, where average family incomes are well below the national average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Has this government not been watching the horrific growth in youth suicide in this country? We have just had a report from a standing committee on that matter. Has the government not noticed that the incidence of youth suicide is greatest in the regions where unemployment is high? Does it not understand that this tactic is going to exacerbate that problem? These are regions where labour market programs have already been slashed and where, as I said, there are fewer jobs available now than there ever were before, certainly than there were before this government came to office. Public sector jobs are largely gone, as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does this government not realise that pulling $145 out of a struggling family's fortnightly budget is a recipe for disaster? Like the work for the dole scheme, this policy does not represent a serious attempt to address the unemployment problem in this country, nor does it seek to really be serious about fixing the school retention rates or getting people into training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is really about conservative ideology. `When all else fails,' they say, `get the big stick out to those dole bludgers in working&hyphen;class areas.' We should have a look at the work for the dole scheme and look at where the projects have gone, Madam Deputy Speaker. I do not know how many you got in your Labor electorate. You indicate that you got none. Guess how many we got in Hunter. Youth unemployment rates in the lower end of the electorate are at least more than 30 per cent. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10819">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that the youth unemployment rate is 19 per cent, but that is the average across the electorate. In the lower Hunter the rates are in excess of 30 per cent. How many projects came to the Hunter electorate? Not one. Yet I heard Minister Kemp on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair </EMPHASIS>being asked about the number of projects that went to the Hunter. He very cleverly said that 19 projects went to the Hunter and the North Coast. He just threw in the bit about the North Coast.

That is the approach of this government in terms of addressing the youth unemployment problem in this country. Some will say that the Labor Party opposed the work for the dole scheme, and we did.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, most of his speech, whilst worthy in intent, missed the mark in many aspects and I will take the opportunity through my delivery to address some of those. The first point is that the whole reason for this <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997</XREF>  which is being debated is to give a real incentive for younger people to further their education and training, which is the greatest thing you can give a young person to ensure that they do not join the ranks of the unem 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10820"> ployed. The previous government were in power for more than a decade&mdash;13 years&mdash;and saw an enormous rise of youth unemployment. Indeed, I am sure that if they had been in government today a similar youth allowance would have been introduced by them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I propose to give honourable members a description of the bill, its benefits and whom it will cover. Youth allowance is one more initiative down a positive path of reform that this government has embarked on. Youth allowance is an important positive social policy reform and we do not step aside from that. It is an initiative which the government is undertaking, but not in response to the hypocritical, superficial rhetoric regrettably coming from my colleague on the left. Those opposite were expelled from office, not least because youth unemployment increased to a staggering 32.3 per cent. Worse still, youth unemployment in the Richmond&hyphen;Tweed mid&hyphen;North Coast region was over 50 per cent prior to the 1996 federal election. There is no question that all members of this House would agree that high levels of unemployment are one of the principal causes of despair, lack of self&hyphen;esteem and regrettably, in many parts of Australia, a totally unacceptable and tragic level of youth suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has consulted widely on this bill. Back in 1996 when we went out to the community, young people, their families and the general community told us that the current arrangements are unfair, inefficient and far too complex. We inherited a system that treats the young in a similar situation very differently according to whether they are students or unemployed. What is a youth allowance? Essentially, it is an income support payment for young Australians which integrates payments irrespective of whether they are for education, training, unemployment or sickness. I note that the opposition does not have a problem with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The job market is very difficult for inexperienced people. As the member for Hunter said, unless you have training, your prospects of getting a job are significantly diminished. This is particularly so for young people. The facts are that if you do not complete secondary schooling, if you leave in year 10 and do 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not go on to year 12&mdash;I acknowledge there has been an increase in the number of people going on to year 12, but it is not enough&mdash;you have a three times higher probability of being unemployed. They are the facts. One in five Australians coming out of school today is technically illiterate, according to the ABS. A further 30 per cent do not reach the standards a modern society requires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What chance do these young people have of getting a job? This is yet another problem we have inherited from 13 years under the ALP. It is another problem which is not of our making but which we intend to fix. Full&hyphen;time and part&hyphen;time employment for 15&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds has fallen by three per cent since 1982. By comparison, total full&hyphen;time employment has grown 16 per cent and total full&hyphen;time and part&hyphen;time employment&mdash;which is the trend in our labour market now&mdash;have grown 31 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance is intended to send a clear message to young people that the best pathway to a job is through education or training, and is intended to encourage them to take advantage of increased vocational, education and training opportunities before they look for a job. That is quite sensible. The youth allowance is based on a philosophy of family values where the responsibility for children is the responsibility of parents first and the state second. It has also become self&hyphen;evident to all except the Labor Party that we need competitive young Australians who are well skilled and confident and who can take us into the next century as our most valuable resource, particularly as we compete with Asia. Wasn't that what the previous Prime Minister meant when he said `looking at the big picture'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The common youth allowance offers a wide variety of benefits compared with current arrangements. It offers incentive to study rather than to go on the dole. It offers a greater coverage for those young people who need assistance as well as simplification, equity for rural Australia and a consistent parental means test. I propose to address these issues. With respect to more incentive to study: as I have demonstrated before, under the system we inherited, as many on this side 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10821"> would realise, you are better off going on the dole. It is easier to go on that than to go to school or university. It is harder to get Austudy to further your education than it is to go on the disgraceful system we have now, where it is easy to go on social security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, the common youth allowance will remove disincentives to study. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> accurately laid the blame on poorly designed incentives and labour market rigidities as well as a failure in schooling and vocational training. This government has done much to improve this over the past year by focusing on literacy and basic skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance complements these achievements. It will encourage people to complete or further their education by removing undesirable incentives to leave school early or to choose unemployment over education and training. One particular improvement which I welcome is the increase in rent assistance for students. This will benefit a massive 70,000 students who, on average, will gain over $30 per fortnight&mdash;a very positive response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has massively increased funding towards apprenticeships, traineeships and TAFE places. It has  increased funding for schools by $14 billion over the next four years. This will cater for some of those who stay at school. But in the area of apprenticeships and traineeships there will be 100,000 places. Under the previous government, numbers of apprenticeships and traineeships were at their lowest level since World War II as people were funnelled into, in most cases, unworkable labour market programs which distorted the market and did not give those people some elementary training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the New South Wales coast, traineeships in the last year have taken off, particularly in the areas of tourism, new forms of agriculture and retail. We have seen expanded places now in TAFE colleges at Kingscliff and Wollongbar, and an upgrade is now happening at Murwillumbah.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We inherited from the previous government great structural problems within the labour market. We need to redress this problem. We still have an unskilled, uneducated 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> work force. When you look at the gospel of Beazley, it is interesting to see that in many ways those opposite are still wishing to encourage this by a throwback to the early policies of the eighties and, with some of their other policies, the fifties. The electorate is far more sophisticated now, as certainly are young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We are addressing labour market problems by trying to foster a climate for training and education&mdash;and we are being quite deliberate about it&mdash;which will attract young people. One of the other areas has been the changes we have made to industrial relations and our industrial reforms. It is a shame that there was not unanimous support, certainly by the opposition, regarding the cry over unfair dismissal reforms, particularly to small business. We particularly wanted to ensure that small businesses with under 15 employees could put a person on knowing that, if things did not work out, each of them had an adequate exit route within the first 12 months. This would have been of enormous benefit to young people because employers would have given them the chance to have a start. In most cases that is what they are looking for&mdash;a start in the employment market. Regrettably that was denied by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The common youth allowance will apply to 560,000 young people who are currently on income support. Of these, 416,000 are students aged between 16 and 25. The other 144,000 are unemployed people aged between 16 and 21. Precisely the point that we are trying to focus on is giving them greater education and greater skills to get them into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is not, as the dilettantes opposite vainly try to portray it, a savings measure. In fact, this government will be spending more&mdash;$25 million more, or $50 per receipt, on program costs alone. However, as with any major reform, not everyone will be better off. Of course, there will be some winners and losers, but there will be three times more winners. That is a key point in this youth allowance policy. Of the 560,000 young people who will transfer into the new system, 378,000 will receive the same money as they currently are receiving. A staggering 137,000 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10822"> additional young Australians across the country will receive an increased amount, compared to 45,000 who will receive less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Another benefit of the common youth allowance is that it will replace the exceptionally unwieldy arrangements that this government inherited. The introduction of this new payment thus fulfils our election promise. As opposed to what the member for Hunter has said, we have fulfilled an enormous range of our election promises which go to simplifying income support payments. It is exactly what we have done with Centrelink.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The youth allowance will be replacing the five differential payments&mdash;namely, Austudy for students aged 16 to 24, the youth training, newstart and sickness allowances for 16&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, and the `more than minimum' family payment for secondary students aged 16 to 18 who are currently not getting Austudy. Contrary to the hysteria generated by the Labor Party and other minority parties, the youth allowance does not affect Abstudy, the assistance for isolated children's scheme, the pensioner education supplement, the disability support pension, the sole parent pension, the parenting allowance and the veterans' children education scheme, and on it goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What it is doing is bringing 13 schemes into five. At the same time, the reform recognises that there is a growing number of young people who do not follow the traditional pathway from full-time study to full-time employment. Under the new system, young people whose personal circumstances change slightly  will no longer have their payments cancelled and be forced to reclaim another&mdash;a positive measure. Australians, irrespective of their political persuasion, are sick and tired of red tape. This government is trying to cut through it, and it will achieve that with the youth allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> More importantly, this bill gives equity particularly to rural Australia. The government recognises that educating and finding jobs for children&mdash;my children are very young and will be looking for employment in years to come&mdash;is very difficult. Rural families will benefit from the youth allowance because, as I have said before, rent assistance will be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> available for the first time to young people who live away from home and who are in an educational course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is especially important to the electorate of Richmond, where over 10 per cent of the population is between the ages of 15 and 24. Most of them, if they are continuing higher education, will need to travel out of the electorate. I do not have the luxury of a university in my electorate, although we have some very good ones nearby&mdash;Southern Cross University at Lismore and Griffith University on the Gold Coast, and we have access to other universities both in Brisbane and, further afield, in Sydney. So rent assistance will be a major benefit to these people. Contrary to what the member for Hunter said, enrolments at Southern Cross University, even with the increase in HECS fees, have actually increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the issue of who qualifies for the new allowance. To qualify for the youth allowance, young people aged 18 and over will need to undertake full-time study, training or job search. For those under 18, the payments will be linked to their participation in full-time education or training. But there will be some buffer zones and exemptions&mdash;for those people who are homeless, ill or unable to access appropriate education or training. There is a safety net for those people who are not able to obtain it or have disadvantaged situations at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Consistent parental means testing will remove one of the major anomalies between existing support programs for young people. It will encourage parental support and also ensure that young people in similar circumstances have similar entitlements. The parental means test component of this bill measures the parents' capacity to take financial responsibility for the living expenses of their dependant children. The test will consist of a parental income test, a parental assets test and an actual means test. The parental means test reinforces the government's message that families which are unable to support younger members will be treated fairly, which is very different to the type of culture that was encouraged by the previous government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10823">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key concept in means testing is fairness and the bill recognises that many young people will be exempt from the parental means test, as I have demonstrated before, as will those young people who are married, have children or are disadvantaged. It comes into place on 1 July 1998. It has already received considerable praise outside this chamber. I quote:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> &mdash;not a paper well known to be supporting the government&mdash;in its editorial entitled `Without dole, responsibility'. Another good article, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> &mdash;also not a great advocate of the government&mdash;was even more effusive in welcoming the changes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government's decision to ditch the dole for under-18s and tighten access to benefits for 18 to 21-year-olds should be vigorously applauded. So should its move to replace a range of youth benefits . . . with a single payment, and its efforts to push the young jobless to improve their skills rather than remain idle. . . The changes . . . are weighted towards solid Australian values and hard work . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Exactly what the battlers of your constituency advocate. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  went on to say that the `changes help engender a culture of self-improvement rather than the welfare-dependence and dole culture which has crept into the Australian life' and ethos. Even an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily News</EMPHASIS> , which is my local paper in Tweed Heads, said under the banner `Dole overhaul long overdue':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the scheme appears to be built around a desire to see our young people either in a training program, furthering their education, or at home with their families who love and support them. Surely, this is a preferable scenario to the dole.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course the government is embarking on other measures to assist with this tragedy that we have of high youth unemployment: the JPET program, better known as the Job 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Placement Employment and Training program, the work for the dole scheme and the hugely popular Green Corps, which have all been warmly welcomed by the people on the North Coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that the JPET program in Richmond, where over $250,000 of Commonwealth funding went into a program which is aimed at helping disadvantaged young people with accommodation, employment, education and training, was actually introduced by the previous government. The JPET program in Byron and Ballina, run by the Byron youth services, does a fantastic job. It is delivering help for under-20-year-olds to tackle the problem of getting full accommodation, training and employment and the problem of self&hyphen;esteem. It is also trying to reduce the heinous proliferation we have now of drugs&mdash;a situation not unique to Byron or other parts of Richmond but right across Australia. It is a very worthwhile program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, we have a number of work for the dole projects in the Richmond electorate ranging from Cabarita, west to Murwillumbah and south to Ballina. The New South Wales North Coast has been given great support in these projects by Centrelink&mdash;another major initiative&mdash;through getting volunteers for that work for the dole scheme. These organisations are Tweed Shire Council, Ballina Skills Development Centre, Tweed Training and Enterprise Co. and Environmental Training and Employment. All are doing very worthy projects: getting young people and  giving them some self&hyphen;esteem and getting them some training under that mutual obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Green Corps has been another hugely successful project. I have had the benefit of going along to see, witness and explore what they are doing, particularly at Fingal Head, Hastings Point, Kingscliff&mdash;that is one Green Corps project&mdash;Broken Head near Byron Bay, and Wollongbar with its restoration of the Big Scrub remnants. The Green Corps project has given incredible self&hyphen;esteem to those young people who do not necessarily have to be unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other organisations in my electorate I would like to thank for giving their support to youth services are the Tweed Valley Family 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10824"> and Youth Support Service; the Tweed Heads Police and Citizens Youth Club; the youth groups in Tweed Heads, Tweed Coast and Murwillumbah; St Joseph's Youth Hostel; Byron Youth Centre; Ballina Youth Centre; and Recovery 2000 run by a very remarkable lady called Shel Hillman. I would also like to thank all the local volunteer organisations in Richmond for the tireless work they do in aiding the young people of the Northern Rivers&mdash;organisations such as the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul and the church groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future of the young people of Australia should not be a political battlefield. I urge all members to support this bill, which is geared to encourage young people to better themselves through further education and training so that we can reduce that huge level of youth unemployment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In many ways the contrast between the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997</XREF>  and the former government's Working Nation program sums up the differences between the Howard government, with the support of the Liberal and National parties, and the Labor opposition. It is quite an interesting contrast. In the legislation before the House, we have a government, through its common youth allowance, trying to take away the support which has been provided in the past through newstart to 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Australians who, unfortunately, are out of work but are actively seeking work&mdash;that, of course, being the central obligation before people are eligible for support from the government. This government is seeking to take away support from those 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Australians who are unlucky enough to be out of work and it also seeks to impose quite a harsh new means test on young Australians who are under 21.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contrast between a government trying to force people, through this common youth allowance, to return to school or become dependent on their parents for support and the alternative of the former Labor government is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quite remarkable. It is quite remarkable when you consider that the alternative the former Labor government had in operation was a massive injection of federal funding to provide training programs&mdash;training opportunities&mdash;for these very same young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate is on the New South Wales Central Coast, and through quite a large number of organisations who receive funding under a wide range of programs under Working Nation we were able to work together to see if there were ways that we could find new opportunities for young Australians who were out of work and even new opportunities for some of the older Australians who had been out of work for longer periods of time. Through groups such as Wyong Workwise, the local Skillshare operation in Wyong shire, and Wyong Council, through one of the jobskills programs, we were able to ensure that there were many opportunities for our young local residents who were out of work to improve their opportunities for employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opportunities were improved by giving them opportunities to do practical training that was relevant to them in their career desires and also gave them the greatest opportunity to develop practical skills that would make them potential candidates for employment in the local community. The alternative which this government is offering is a common youth allowance which seeks to say to Australians under 18, `You must return to school or you will be denied any of the entitlements you have received in the past through the newstart program.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the date the new common youth allowance takes effect the people living in the electorate of the previous speaker, the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), are going to face some difficulties. One of those difficulties will be that a large number of families in that electorate are going to be denied the income that was coming in through the support that was flowing to the 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate of Dobell on the New South Wales Central Coast our calculations suggest that there are going to be a lot of families who are going to have to reach into 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10825"> their pockets to provide this extra support to their young kids. These will often be families who are already doing it very tough. Families who are trying to live on very tight budgets are now going to be expected to provide the extra funding to their kids for bus fares, clothing, food and lodging. That is going to be very difficult for those people on tight budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response to these criticisms is that there is no need for these 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds to depend on their parents. If they go back to school and finish year 12 they will continue to receive the same amount of support as they would have received when looking for work and receiving support from the government. The difficulty is that that is going to place enormous pressure on our local high schools in areas like the Central Coast. The figures for the New South Wales Central Coast, which is covered mainly by the electorates of Robertson and Dobell and partly by the electorate of my colleague the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), show that we are going to see a return of about 693 students to Central Coast high schools. Basing your calculations on where people live&mdash;according to their post&hyphen;codes&mdash;you can estimate that approximately 320 of those students will be in the electorate of Dobell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not expect you to know how crowded the high schools are on the New South Wales Central Coast, Mr Deputy Speaker, but they are already extremely  overcrowded. The two high schools at Wyong and The Entrance and the high school in the neighbouring electorate of Shortland and that at Gorokan in my own electorate have all already reached their quotas for students. Northlakes High School, just over the border in the electorate of Shortland again, has already exceeded its quota of students. Further south, The Entrance High School alone might be forced to take about 150 new students, based on post&hyphen;code information. Most of those students may not wish to be at school. If you have massive overcrowding in the high school, it is certainly going to be extremely difficult for the teachers at those schools to try to provide the sorts of educational opportunities that all of us would hope could be provided.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, difficulties have arisen in the past with students who are plainly uninterested in continuing their studies at high school. Whether because of parental direction or instruction, students return to school when they do not wish to be at school. Unfortunately, it is often the case that a single student who is not finding the courses relevant or stimulating and is not paying attention and is distracting not only the teacher but all the other students in the class can deny all the other students the opportunity to learn additional skills and to learn something about the curriculum courses in years 11 and 12.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This problem is going to get worse as this government seeks to force larger numbers of 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen; year&hyphen;olds, if not all 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, to return to school to finish year 12. One of the ways we can try to ameliorate this problem is to encourage all the state departments of education to continue working on new subjects and curricula that provide skills and training that are relevant for 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who may currently be unemployed but may be forced to return to the education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the current Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, (Dr Kemp), has sought to conduct an illegitimate debate about the standards in many of our schools, but I certainly believe there is strong support out there in the community for additional courses which are relevant for young people who may be forced to return to high school because of this government's legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This overcrowding problem on the Central Coast will to some extent be addressed by the activities of two of our state members. Jill Hall, the current state member for Swansea and the future member for Shortland in this House has been very active in lobbying the New South Wales Minister for Education, John Aquilina, for the funding for a new high school at Lake Munmorah. My state colleague, Paul Crittenden, the member for Wyong has been successful in obtaining approval for a new high school to be built at Warnervale, an area which is already starting to undergo very rapid population growth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10826">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The massive increase in the number of students in high schools on the Central Coast can be contrasted with what is going to happen in some of the areas such as the North Shore of Sydney. I mentioned before that 693 people in the target age group who receive unemployment benefits currently live on the Central Coast. If 693 are encouraged or forced&mdash;depending on which verb you wish to choose&mdash;to return to the local schools, that can be contrasted with what is going to happen in suburbs to the south of us. In places like the North Shore you can see quite clearly that there will be a much reduced effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An analysis which has been done by my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) indicates that in places like Gosford 127 young people who are 16 or 17 years old will be forced back to school, but in places like Manly there are three, in Cammeray there is one and in Killara there is one. In Campbelltown there are 226 and in the western suburbs of Sydney at Mount Druitt there are 282. It is quite clear that the additional overcrowding problems are going to occur in the outer metropolitan suburbs&mdash;in places like the Central Coast, the western suburbs of Sydney, the Campbelltown district and Wollongong. It is these areas that will bear the brunt of this government's decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the federal government has not been prepared to provide additional funding to the state departments of education to cater for the additional 27,000 students that this new common youth allowance is expected to force back into schools right around the country. If the government were serious, it would have increased the funding to the states by about $140 million to ensure that there were  sufficient resources in our state education system to cope with the influx that will result from these particular measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker in this debate, the honourable member for Richmond, also trumpeted the success of the government's work for the dole program. I always appreciate it when members of the government bring up the work for the dole program, because I think it will go down in the Australian community as one of the Howard government's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> worst mistakes. One of the reasons why I think it is a mistake is that many members of the Australian community are not aware of the quite limited nature of John Howard's work for the dole program. Under this Prime Minister, a work for the dole program&mdash;which was clearly the result of Liberal Party polling rather than any serious attempt to assist young unemployed Australians&mdash;was announced on the weekend that the government was facing enormous pressure as a result of a series of newspaper articles about former Senator Bob Woods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is this work for the dole program? It is two days a week, not five; it is available only to a limited number of young Australians; and there is no provision for funding for proper skills training as part of the work for the dole program. If the government were serious about providing young  Australians with proper skills and training, there would be something which we in Working Nation called reciprocal obligations. There should be obligations on young people receiving support from the government that they work for a local community organisation or they undergo approved training or a combination of the above. If they are not prepared to meet that obligation to the community, they should lose the support they are going to receive from the government. That is the obligation that should be placed on the young person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The obligation on the government is to provide young people with the support they need for five days a week of work or training and to provide funding for the training to take place. The government should make sure that such a scheme is available to all young Australians who are in need of additional skills or additional opportunities, not just the lucky 10,000 or 20,000 that the Prime Minister has decided should be eligible for his work for the dole program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other difficulty I have with people like the member for Richmond trumpeting the success of his projects under the work for the dole program is that it is quite clear these projects have been chosen on a party political basis. I am pleased that the member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) has chosen this moment to walk into the chamber. I was not

In fact, it is higher in the northern half of the Central Coast than it is in the southern half of the Central Coast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Isn't it a coincidence that, of the electorates that cover the Central Coast that happened to receive work for the dole project funding, two of them just happen to be Liberal electorates and no projects at all were funded within the electorate of Dobell? Isn't it a coincidence that an analysis of the 25 electorates that have the highest rates of youth unemployment in the country shows that, of the 13 that receive no work for the dole project funding, 10 happen to be Labor electorates? I am sure that the government can come up with proper analyses that explain why it is the Labor electorates that have had Medicare offices closed and why it is the Labor electorates that have missed out on project funding to help young unemployed people. We would like to hear the government bring forward those explanations. We would like to hear the government try to explain how they have reached these decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to touch on a couple of other comments made by the member for Robertson in his contribution to this debate. He was quite critical of the contribution of the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) in this debate. He made a number of allegations that she had incorrectly claimed that large numbers of people would be worse off, especially large numbers of young unemployed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it will be quite a rude awakening for people such as the member for Richmond and the member for Robertson when this common youth allowance takes effect, when large numbers of people in both of those electorates find out that families on very tight budgets will be expected to support their young people when in the past the government has provided some modest assistance as long as they were actively seeking work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When these families, many of whom are on low incomes, have their support from the federal government reduced or abolished, I hope they pick up the phone and ring the members for Robertson and Richmond to let them know that it has affected them and that decisions which we take here affect people out there in the wider community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very interested to listen to the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) as he said that this legislation made the great contrast between this government and the previous government. He talked about Working Nation, the massive injection of funds and the training programs. I recall a little bit of that as a member of the opposition, and the frustration of those people who had been long&hyphen;term unemployed. They went onto these programs, worked for six months and then came into my office more frustrated than when they began because there was no employment waiting for them after they had been recycled through one of these so&hyphen;called training programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was another issue that caught my attention during the week in a poll that was done&mdash;I think it was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>&mdash;where 57 per cent of Australians believed that welfare was too easy to get. The most remarkable part of that poll was that 47 per cent on welfare itself believed that it was too easy to get. The great fallacy of what the member for Dobell has tried to convince us of tonight is that somehow or other this massive injection of funds is plucked from fresh air, that it comes from nowhere and that it is created by governments, ministers and politicians. Most Australians know that is nonsense. They know that it comes straight from the taxpayer's pocket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of teenagers in full&hyphen;time jobs in 1966 was 59 per cent. The number of teenagers in full&hyphen;time jobs in 1984 had nearly halved to 33 per cent. If we trace back the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issue of unemployment benefits, which were introduced in 1944, we find that from March 1973 to November 1975 the youth rates of unemployment benefit were the same as the full adult allowance rate. That was, of course, during the period of the Whitlam government. We know that levels of unemployment increased dramatically from the early 1970s. In 1972 there were about 70,000 unemployed aged from 15 to 25, growing to 320,000 for the same period by 1983. In the 1970s, at the time of the Whitlam government formulated policy, concerns grew that the income support rates were providing too much of a financial incentive for the unemployed. Support for this view was generally agreed to emanate from the increasing youth wages relative to those of adults in the period 1972 to 1974. There was a significant jump in youth unemployment rates in 1975 and a continuance of high youth unemployment through to the 1970s. I remind the House that in 1966 almost 60 per cent of teenagers had full&hyphen;time jobs but in 1984 just over half that number had full&hyphen;time jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell makes the point that there will be some people who will need to go back into the schooling system and that the federal government should provide for that extra income. I am happy to have a look at that but I think we will find that the federal government has been extremely generous in its funding of the state school system in the forward estimates into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my part speech tonight, I would remind the member for Dobell that Tony Blair, the new Labor Prime Minister of the UK, said that the most important thing that a government can do is provide a job provided by an employer&mdash;not a job provided by the government and not a job supported by the taxpayer, but a job provided by the employer. That is the full purpose of this Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also remind the House that the youth allowance is to replace numerous payments, including the youth training allowance, the newstart allowance, the sickness allowance for 16&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year olds and most 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds receiving these payments.</PARA>

We have received representations from a number of people who are keen to make representations to the committee but who are worried that if they do so they may be in breach of secrecy obligations and provisions entered into by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them in the course of their war service or in the years immediately following.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of those approaches, the honourable member for Moore and I raised this matter of concern with the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who is of course the father of the House. He has replied to me in recent days and I would like to take the opportunity, so as to encourage those members of the public who have an interest in this matter and may wish to make a submission to the Defence Subcommittee's inquiry, to read the letter in full into the record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 14 November 1997 seeking advice on the position of individuals who may wish to give evidence to the Committee's inquiry into the loss of HMAS<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Sydney</EMPHASIS>  in 1941, but who fear prosecution because, in the giving of such evidence, they may breach secrecy undertakings made during or after World War II.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a general principle you would be aware that, once a submission has been received by a parliamentary committee and authorised for publication, parliamentary privilege extends to that submission, protecting the author from prosecution or adverse actions by others because of the submission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a prospective witness was apprehensive about the giving of evidence, notwithstanding the protection made explicitly by the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, they could request that their submission be confidential, and that the Committee consider taking evidence in camera.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee prefers that as much evidence as possible be on the public record, and would consider such requests on a case by case basis. It should be noted, however, that the Committee (and indeed both Houses) retains the power subsequently to authorise the publication of evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to the possibility of restrictions on individuals because of statutory secrecy provisions, such secrecy provisions have no effect on the powers of the Houses or their committees to conduct inquiries.

Mr Rose, the former secretary to the Attorney&hyphen;General in the Labor government and now chair of the LRC, has chosen to continue his partisan links by colluding with ALP members by backgrounding the member for Banks and Senator Bolkus and extreme elements of the Aboriginal industry. In fact, Mr Rose's actions confirm his increasing status as a Labor Party apparatchik.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be made clear that there are other opinions which support the constitutional validity of the government's 10-point plan.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to express my concern for the Australian tourism industry. Some have leapt, and no doubt still will leap, to their feet to try and make political mileage out of tagging me as being responsible for the number of international visitors not increasing as much this year as last year. This, of course, is of no substance and simply opportunistic, just like everything else I have been blamed for by my political opponents in their bid to make me appear bad for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all know, I have been held to blame for just about every ill that has befallen our country. Many of my fellow Australians have been left wondering about just how perfect Australia must have been before my election in March last year. I must say, with my tongue firmly in my cheek, just how amazing it is that one small red&hyphen;headed Australian woman from Ipswich could in such a small space of time destroy our trade, foreign relations, exports, jobs and, of course, tourism, to name but a few. Next year I am planning to make it rain for 40 days and 40 nights, so I suggest the members of this House start building their arks and gathering their animals two by two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I have done nothing else in this House, at least I have allowed our politicians to hone

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw it. Tourism is one of our country's most important employers, with one in nine jobs in Australia found in this industry, but for many reasons it is becoming clear tourism cannot be our lone saviour. While I do not in any way wish to detract from my support for tourism, I must acknowledge it will never replace the many jobs lost through the treacherous policies of successive governments. So I will, of course, continue to push the need to revitalise the many industries devastated by the destructive push for globalisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will always welcome law abiding visitors from everywhere and I am proud that so many people are able to experience the magnificent uniqueness of Australia. I hope more Australians will have the opportunity of owning tourism businesses and offering our young people rewarding careers in this exciting industry. There have been many setbacks for the industry but none of these things relates to me, rather they are more plausible issues: too high an expectation by the Tourism Forecasting Council, currency fluctuations, marketing errors, the humbling of the tiger economies of Asia, competition from so many other destinations around the world and quite simply the fact that you cannot stay on top forever. There is only one place to go from number one; even the Beatles and Bing Crosby were eventually outsold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very disturbing that outgoing tourism is growing at 15 per cent while domestic tourism is essentially flat. I cannot speak too loudly in encouraging Australians to spend as much of their holiday dollar as possible in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10832"> Australia. Please see our own country first&mdash;there is so much to see. The sights and sounds available here in our country range from beauty to adventure and are so diverse in nature it is difficult for other countries to compete with the splendour and magnificence of the Australian experience. Our Australia, the greatest island in the world, is host to Australian businesses and jobs that need and deserve the support of our own people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that it is unfortunate that so much of the profits from tourism have left Australia through foreign ownership as in many cases we failed to invest in our own natural showcase. I hope Australian investors buy up the current bargains and therefore help to keep profits here in Australia. It would be nice to fully reclaim somewhere like Hayman Island. In the meantime, Peppers in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, the Coconut Beach Rainforest Resort at Cape Tribulation in Queensland and the Wilpena Resort in South Australia's Flinders Ranges are just some examples of the different styles of Australian owned properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an appalling situation that the federal government does not provide any funding to promote the concept of Australians seeing Australia. The growing exodus to see the world must be balanced by a campaign that will promote the best destination in the world, our own home.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to pay tribute to two wonderful people in my electorate who passed away last week. I talk about George and Doris Ladhams. George Ladhams was very well known to me, as of course was his wife, Doris. George suffered from kidney failure late last week, and his wife had been battling poor health for some time. They were both in the same hospital. Within two hours of George's death, Doris died from the shock of it all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to talk about these two people tonight because I believe that they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were the type of Australian whom we all aspire to live up to. They were the type of Australian we should have more of in this country of ours&mdash;rather than perhaps the sort of Australian from whom we have just heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">George and Doris Ladhams had always been hard-working people. For much of his life George was involved in the timber industry, building mill cottages for the Karri Timber company. Eventually, through very hard work, he became the manager of Whittakers timber mill in Serpentine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">George and Doris first started off as farmers in the farming area around the outskirts of Perth. But, of course, we all know how difficult it is to make any money out of farming. So, rather than blame governments, they packed up their bags and decided it was up to them to make a future for themselves. They then went to settle in Northcliffe and later in Serpentine working in the timber industry. Whilst they brought up their family and George was busy earning a living, Doris of course involved herself in the traditional women's activities of those days, such as the Country Women's Association, the Red Cross, and she worked for the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At some stage George decided to become involved in local government. As I said before, he was the sort of person whom we should all look up to. He felt that it was up to him to give back to the community that had given to him. Not only did he participate in the shire's affairs, but he rose to become the president of the shire. At that time he decided also to become involved in politics. I understand that, since approximately 1950, George had been a member of the Liberal Party. Indeed, he was a very active member of my division of Canning, taking on executive positions and becoming a member of state council. Eventually George and his family moved to Kelmscott, another suburb in my electorate, where they stayed until this recent tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was something special about George: he was the type of person who, when he committed himself to something, did it 120 per cent. I first met George back in 1984 on my first campaign. At that time he was a little sceptical of this slip of a girl who was going 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10833"> to have a go at federal politics&mdash;because, after all, women did not go into politics, and certainly not into federal politics! He sort of looked at me in a slightly sceptical way. But I think he very soon recognised that I had the determination, the talent and the desire to do something for this country. George and his wife, Doris, and I became very, very good friends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">George kept on working in the community. Regardless of what knocks there were in life, he pulled himself up again and did what he could for others. He became a member of the Freemason lodge; he was very much involved in that. Approximately two years ago, George lost his leg as a result of diabetes. But this did not stop him from being committed. In 1996, when we went to the election, there was George, sitting in his wheelchair, minus half of his leg, manning his polling booth, just as he had done since 1953, or whenever. That is the sort of person I think this parliament should be paying tribute to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, we should be paying tribute to his wife. She suffered at times because George was absorbed in his politics and community works. And he was not always there when he should have been. I can honestly say that George and Doris were people I came to know not only as my friends; if not for my own parents, whom I love dearly, I would have been proud to call them my parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">George and Doris leave behind a son and daughter-in-law and three wonderful grandchildren. The grandchildren now all have jobs, an issue which worried George and Doris for some time. But they kept on having faith in the ability of their grandchildren to succeed. They had faith in the future of our country, and they knew that those kids would eventually get a job. To the loved ones whom they left behind, I pay my deepest respects tonight. I do hope that the world produces more people like George and Doris.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10833"><TITLE>Hunter Region: Steel Making

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to say something about the great opportunities that exist for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> new steel makers to come into the Hunter region. BHP has made it clear that they want to end steel making in the Hunter in 1999. The point I want to make is that the Hunter region and Port Newcastle is the prime location in Australia to make steel. It is ideally placed to service domestic and overseas markets. It has reliable and cheap energy. It has skilled and dedicated workers. It has good deepwater access and good existing port facilities. It has excellent access to the national road and rail grids. We have an established network of the latest steel making services, and Australia's best and strongest steel making know&hyphen;how.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need now is to market those advantages and those strengths around the world. The time used to be when BHP to this country was `the steel manufacturer'; today BHP is `a steel manufacturer'. Sure, BHP wanted a power of veto on steel making in Newcastle; they do not want another steel maker in Newcastle. That is the world they would like to have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we have a quiet achiever in the Hunter in ANI. At the moment they are producing about 200,000 tonnes of steel with an electric arc furnace; they want to increase production. We also have Mr Clive Palmer and his mineralogy process&mdash;his company with which he is associated. From my understanding and reading of his technology, it is good technology; it certainly needs capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I want to contrast the attitude being expressed by some people in the Hunter that steel making is finished. Steel making will only be finished in the Hunter if we allow it to be finished. I say that because, on the other side of the continent, we see the efforts in Western Australia to set up a $1.4 billion steel making plant 23 kilometres north of Geraldton. We, on the eastern side of the continent, are better placed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the reasons I have outlined, I want to see every possible effort being made now to market the strengths and advantages of the Hunter and Port Newcastle to steel makers&mdash;and to do that around the world. I am talking with my federal colleagues the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), the member for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10834"> Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). We will be undertaking our own efforts to get that information out around to all potential steel makers across the globe. Also, I have approached the state government for them to do similarly. We are the best, we have the best know&hyphen;how and we are the best placed, for all the reasons I have outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not a time to end steel making; it is a time to add to the steel makers. It would be a most regrettable mistake if business leaders in the Hunter were to let pass this opportunity to find a new steel maker to take over from the role of BHP that was prepared to utilise the opportunities that we offer there. That would be a dreadful mistake for the region. We will be doing everything possible to ensure that that mistake does not occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP's efforts in the post-steel making period in Newcastle focus on what is going to happen there, on remediation of site, on development of the Hunter 2000 site, and on attracting new operations there. Indications are that they are probably spending up to tens of millions of dollars. Forty per cent of BHP's work force live in the City of Lake Macquarie, a large part of which is in my electorate of Shortland. We in Lake Macquarie want to see some equity from BHP in investing and in generating jobs and activity not just in Newcastle but in Lake Macquarie, where almost half of their work force is domiciled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the contrary situation at the moment, Mr Speaker, which you have heard me mention in this House before, where the only coastal wetlands in our region is in Lake Macquarie, which BHP is trying to rape, seek possession of and subdivide for housing development to, in effect, generate money which it can spend in Newcastle to cover its departure from steel making. I want to see fairness for my electors and fairness as between Lake Macquarie City Council and Newcastle in the treatment that is accorded them by BHP.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on a project which is happening in Murwillumbah&mdash;the World Heritage Rainforest Centre. This project will have a significant impact on the town of Murwillumbah. It is the rebuilding of the tourism centre. A major expansion is being instigated by the Commonwealth&mdash;with $270,000 from the Commonwealth in addition to $50,000 from a state grant. The World Heritage Rainforest Centre, I believe, will act as a major catalyst in the rejuvenation of Murwillumbah's tourism potential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Murwillumbah has been going through testing times of late because of a change in industry. The dominance of agriculture no longer has a direct bearing on the town, as it used to in the past, there are far more recipients of social security and there have been changes in education and in lifestyles. The World Heritage Rainforest Centre can act as a beacon for attracting tourists from south&hyphen;east Queensland, particularly day trippers from Brisbane, and also from the Gold Coast, and as a hubbing centre to the five world heritage parks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no other place in Australia where we have this concentration of world heritage parks. They have magnificent tourism potential for the Tweed Valley and for the north coast of New South Wales. Those national parks are Springbrook, Lamington National Park, the Border Ranges, Nightcap and Mount Warning, which is in the middle of the Caldera, a mountain of about 3,300 feet. The World Heritage Centre will act as a conduit for tourists coming to Murwillumbah. There will be CD interactive ROM there, there will be lectures, there will be discussions and, hopefully, in due course it will be a transport 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10835"> hub where buses can leave for Murwillumbah for the different national parks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Murwillumbah it is significant because of the flow- on effect that it can give to the town, not just from the tourism angle but to help rejuvenate a town which needs to be upgraded, particularly its main street. I applaud the Main Street Committee, and Tweed Shire Council, which is contributing $600,000 to updating Murwillumbah so it can benefit from the huge commercialism we have seen on the Gold Coast and to a lesser extent in Tweed Heads, which has the cultural and heritage values of what was originally a timber and agricultural town. If this can be developed in conjunction with the World Heritage Centre, which backs on to the Tweed River, then it has immense opportunity to attract people to Murwillumbah as a destination, particularly to our best features, which are the national parks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one project which I feel very passionately about&mdash;and I hope that in due course it can link up&mdash;the Caldera Trail. My vision is to link up the five world heritage parks with a 200&hyphen;kilometre trail, which would start at the water around Currumbin and the Tumbulgum tick gates and travel through these national parks, which could cover a 180 degree arc from the Queensland border through to just north of Mullumbimby, or down near Byron Bay, for those who do not know the area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S145">Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  applies new arrangements to procedures for establishing an interception capability for telecommunications services in Australia and the funding of this interception capability. The bill also deals with minor technical amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997, including aspects of industry development plans, labelling of equipment and ACA industry reports. I will deal firstly with the interception aspects of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Part 15 of the Telecommunications Act 1997, which largely carries forward the arrangements under the Telecommunications Act 1991, telecommunications carriers and nominated carriage service providers must ensure they can execute an interception warrant. The only exception to this is when the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts grants an authorisation. Carriers have also been required to consult with agencies on new technologies before introducing a telecommunications service. Agencies have borne all the costs associated with developing those interception capabilities required to be able to execute an interception warrant and the costs of executing individual warrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the existing arrangements for interception capabilities are no longer suitable. The introduction of some new telecommunications services has been significantly delayed with obvious adverse consequences for business and consumers. On occasion, services have also been introduced without an adequate interception capability impacting adversely upon the operations of law enforcement and national security agencies. The funding of all interception requirements by the agencies, with no industry assistance on the establishment and maintenance of this essential service, has been a large and continuing drain upon the agencies' resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These problems will not go away under the current framework. One of the effects of the opening of the telecommunications market to full competition will be to increase the difficulties and expense faced by the agencies in attempting to negotiate interception capability arrangements with each and every new entrant. Add to this the escalating speed of technological change in telecommunications, and the obvious outcome is increasing delays to the entrance of new market participants and to new services, with implications for the growth and development of the Australian telecommunications market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best long&hyphen;term hope for retaining a cost effective interception capability into the longer run is through international cooperation directed at getting telecommunications equipment vendors&mdash;especially manufacturers of switches&mdash;to include common interception capabilities into their equipment. This will ensure that capabilities are maintained while keeping costs down by sharing them among all user countries and achieving economies of scale.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10838">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill therefore provides for a new level of interception capability based upon the relevant international standard or guideline. The Attorney&hyphen;General will be given the power to determine, via one or more disallowable instruments, the specifics of the new capability. The Attorney&hyphen;General will base this new capability requirement on the international user requirement, IUR, developed by most OECD law enforcement and national security agencies, including Australia, under the auspices of the International Law Enforcement Telecommunications Seminar, ILETS. I have tabled a copy of the IUR with the bill for members' information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, to ensure there is no lapse in the requirement for an interception capability, carriers and carriage service providers will be required to be in a position to execute an interception warrant issued under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 until the Attorney&hyphen;General has made a determination, that is, the `fallback' position will be a continuation of the current capability obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Law enforcement and national security agencies will be able to authorise the operation of a service with a lower or no level of interception capability. This is reasonable given that these agencies are the users of the capability and are in the best position to determine when it is no longer required. The minister will continue to have a reserve power, exercisable with the agreement of the Attorney&hyphen;General, to also grant authorisations. The Australian Communications Authority, ACA, is to be given a limited power to provide exemptions for trial services after appropriate consultations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill continues the current requirement for carriers and nominated carriage service providers to notify the ACA of relevant changes to technology, with the ACA ensuring relevant agencies are consulted. In order  to make sure that the introduction of new telecommunications services is not unduly delayed, the ACA is now required to specify reasonable time frames within which agencies can consider new technologies for each new technology notification. If agencies do not comment within this reasonable period they lose their ability to specify particular delivery requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also introduces new funding arrangements for interception. Agencies will continue to be liable for the costs of executing individual interception warrants, as well as most other matters of `help' that are in addition to the basic listening and recording of a communication. They will also be liable for the costs of establishing capabilities they have specifically requested. The ACA has been given new audit powers to ensure that the most cost&hyphen;effective solutions are adopted. However, carriers will now be required to pay for the costs of providing the interception capability determined by the Attorney&hyphen;General, or the costs of the `fallback' capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to allocating the transmission costs of an intercepted communication, a new concept of the `delivery point' has been introduced in part 14. Individual carriers and carriage service providers, and the agencies, will be required to agree to the location of the `delivery point', with the carrier or carriage service provider paying for the costs of transmitting the intercepted information to the delivery point, and the agencies paying for the transmission costs from the delivery point to the final destination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another new concept, the interception capability plan, is also introduced with this bill. These plans are intended to provide a strategic communications and planning tool for the industry and agencies. Carriers and carriage service providers nominated by the Attorney&hyphen;General will be required to submit these plans on an annual basis and their content will include the policies of the carrier or provider in relation to interception generally, of their strategies for compliance 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10839"> with their interception obligations, a statement of any relevant business developments, and a description of strategies for minimising long run costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill therefore introduces a new framework for the accomplishment of a cost&hyphen;effective and relevant interception capability within Australia. However, we recognise that technologies, the communications market, and the needs of agencies are continuing to evolve rapidly. While telecommunications interception remains for the present a cost&hyphen;effective tool for agencies, it is important that we keep our approach to this issue under review. The bill therefore requires the minister, in consultation with the Attorney&hyphen;General, to cause a review to be conducted before 1 July 1999 into the longer term cost&hyphen;effectiveness of the arrangements provided for in parts 14 and 15 of the act that relate to the funding of telecommunications interception. A copy of the report from this review is to be laid before each house of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also several other matters in the bill which I will now discuss. The bill provides for the labelling requirements for customer equipment and customer cabling under division 7 of part 21 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 to apply not only to manufacturers or importers of this equipment or cabling but also to authorised agents acting in Australia on behalf of such manufacturers or importers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will allow overseas manufacturers and importers to revert back to established agency arrangements whereby their Australian agents take responsibility for ensuring that the requirements for labelling telecommunications customer equipment and customer cabling are met. This will ensure the supply of equipment and cabling to Australia and facilitate the introduction and growth of competition in the supply of goods and services in the Australian telecommunications market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the ACA is currently required to monitor and report each financial year to the minister on all significant matters relating to the performance of carriers and carriage service providers. The bill builds in additional flexibility by giving the minister the power to direct the ACA in relation to the preparation of periodic reports as well as special reports on particular matters that may arise during the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Technical amendments are also proposed to clause 27 of schedule 3 to the act dealing with the carriers' powers and immunities. This clause sets out the matters that the ACA must be satisfied about before it may issue a facility installation permit. It also sets out the things that the ACA must take into account in deciding whether the grounds for a permit have been made out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 27, as currently drafted, requires that, before a facility installation permit can be issued for telecommunications installations other than designated overhead lines, the ACA must be satisfied that both the landowner and the relevant local authority have not consented to the installation. This has the peculiar and unintended consequence that a consent by either a landowner or relevant authority will prevent the ACA from issuing a facility installation permit. The bill amends clause 27 to address this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The re&hyphen;draft makes it clear that the ACA can issue a facility installation permit for non&hyphen;designated overhead lines infrastructure where either the landowner or the relevant authority refuse or withhold consent. The bill also includes an amendment made by the Senate to the bill as introduced to require carriers to negotiate in good faith with both the proprietors and administrative authorities before the ACA can consider issuing a facility installation permit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains minor amendments to part 2 of schedule 1 which covers industry development plan arrangements. The amendments correct shortcomings in the legislation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10840"> relating to when industry development plans are required and when the approval of the industry minister is necessary, as well as clarifying the notification of government policies which carriers must have regard to in preparing their industry development plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first amendment will require all carriers to have a current industry development plan at all times, rather than only when applying for a carrier licence, as currently provided in the act. The second amendment will see amended industry development plans requiring approval of the industry minister, treating them in a similar manner to original plans. The third amendment will require the industry minister to notify carriers and applicants for carrier licences of government policies that are to be taken into account in preparing their plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes a number of other minor and technical amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997, the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1997 and the Trade Practices Act 1974. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="N36">Mr MARTYN EVANS</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Bonython)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.13 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S145">Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , as the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) has just enumerated in his second reading speech, broadly covers and extends the law in the area of telephone and telecommunications interception. This of course has been a time&hyphen;honoured way for law enforcement agencies and national security agencies around the world to ensure that they are abreast of any potential or actual criminal activity. In some countries this has been extended to include a definition of national security which Australians would not agree with and which has been used to support totalitarian regimes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context in which the minister and the government present this legislation, though, it is quite clear that it is in the ordinary course of events for Australian telecommunications interception. It continues the tradition which both major political parties have supported in Australia of allowing this kind of interception in certain specific and regulated cases so that law enforcement agencies can have accurate and up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date intelligence. I am sure that it is of considerable benefit to them in pursuing those who would commit acts such as dealing in narcotic and other dangerous drugs, in cases of child abuse and paedophile activity, and in a range of other criminal and anti&hyphen;social activities which include no lesser crimes than treason against the Australian state and a variety of other activities which we would all want to see curbed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one wants to place any barriers in the way of telephone interception which is done at a reasonable level with reasonable and prudent legal safeguards and where the public can have some confidence that it is for proper and reasonable purposes. That has always been the case in the Australian community, and I have no reason to believe that it would be otherwise under this government. In that context, we in opposition would certainly support the basic thrust of the legislation, which extends the law in that area and imposes some new requirements on telecommunications carriers to fund the costs of some of this work and to provide more convenient delivery point access to agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing fundamentally objectionable in those parts of the bill, and the opposition will not be opposing that particular aspect of the legislation, which is the fundamental thrust of the legislation before us. However, the legislation does raise some other issues. The government recently understood, in part at least, some of the further implications of this kind of legislation when it made the minister for communications also responsible for the development of the information economy. The opposition had recognised this important area 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10841"> some months before. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), I am honoured to say, appointed me as shadow minister for not only science but also information technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both political parties have now recognised the significance of the development of the information economy and of the information age in Australia and indeed globally through their recognition of ministerial and shadow ministerial appointments. However it would seem from this legislation, and from the policy which underlies it, that the government has not yet recognised, unfortunately, the importance of encryption and interception to the development of a sound information based economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are to enter the information age, if we are to have electronic commerce as a substantial part of our economic  activity, then it is essential that legislation like the legislation which we have before us recognises that fact, is cognisant of it and is surrounded by underlying policy in the encryption area in support of electronic commerce which the government integrates and balances against the reasonable needs of law enforcement agencies when they seek to pursue the tasks which I have already identified on behalf of the opposition and which the government endorses they should be able to pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why is that important? Even the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston), in a speech on 14 October, said electronic commerce: . . . over the Net is forecast to increase more than four&hyphen;fold to $6.3 billion by 2001, with more than 1.5 million Australians expected to be using the World Wide Web to purchase goods and services by 2001.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are some other statistics which I will share with the committee shortly. That one snapshot&mdash;$6.3 billion by the year 2001 and 1.5 million Australians using the Internet to purchase goods and services&mdash;within that same time frame highlights dramatically how serious an issue electronic commerce is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Electronic commerce will allow people to make purchases globally, so we are truly entering the age where you can make it anywhere and sell it everywhere. For example, purchasing music on-line&mdash;with the bits that represent the song or the track someone is interested in purchasing being transmitted down the Internet and stored by them on compact disc or on tape for their own pleasure, and they pay for that with their credit card or by electronic cash&mdash;is one form of the information economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It can be anything from music to books, magazines, information generally, research articles&mdash;an enormous area of commerce in the future. Whether people are ordering clothing, food, wine or any other normal commodity, or indeed whether they are ordering accounting services, auditing services, architectural services, legal services, computing services or computer programming talent, these things can be provided from anywhere in the world and the results transmitted electronically. People will pay for those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the minister has said, this will be a massively increasing area of the Australian and global economy in the years to come. That change will take place rapidly. We should not underestimate the rate of change which will occur in this area. It was only in 1969 that the Internet was first developed by the US government, initially as a military facility but subsequently taken over by the civilian population and the academic university groups because of its value to them as a means of communication, as a new means of enhancing global trade and as a means of advancing global culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The change since then has been dramatic. We have gone from a time, only some 20 years ago, where no-one was using the network, where no Internet existed, to a time now where millions of people around the world do. We have an Internet growth rate which exceeds the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10842"> growth rate of any other aspect of our economy or indeed of human society. If we do not make plans now, if we do not have policies now, if our legislation in 1997 does not incorporate and understand the implications of electronic commerce, we will be behind the eight ball when those days come&mdash;in too few years&mdash;when so many people are using the Internet that it is a significant issue for us. That is why I would like to turn to the specific provisions of the bill today to highlight where they fail to recognise that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although ostensibly the bill deals with the simple routine interception of the plain old telephone service, the new digital mobile service and other forms of common communication, we have significant implications for electronic commerce and the new information society which surrounds it. This bill will impact on nominated carriage service providers, such as Internet service providers. In my own state, Camtech is a major regional supplier, but there are others such as Ozemail and Big Pond, which is run by Telstra. A number of these very large Internet service providers are likely to be required to be covered by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue will be what kind of impact that will have on their broader service provision. These people do not sell simple telecommunication services. They do not sell end to end, point to point voice communication. They sell the movement of data and information&mdash;commercially valuable information, financial information, health information and personal data. It is much more than a simple telecommunications network. These people often have value added networks which are associated with it. A number of those agencies&mdash;Telstra not the least and Camtech in my own state&mdash;are providing a variety of secure additional services as part of their network which people are joining in order to offer electronic commerce not only in Australia, although the domestic market is substantial, but also throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can access the Internet from anywhere in the world. You can access an Australian supplier and you can do business. Increasingly, people will do business in that way. If these service providers are required under this legislation to provide agencies on demand with decrypted data flowing over their network, this will have a number of effects. It will fundamentally undermine the confidence which people have in Internet commerce and in the security of that commerce. That is an important psychological factor, and it is an important real impact on their ability to undertake large financial transactions in a secure way. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that, without secure encryption, there will be serious difficulties for electronic commerce in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implications go beyond that. The reality is that it is very important in electronic commerce to be able to identify exactly who you are and exactly whom you are dealing with. There is a famous saying on the Internet that on the Internet no-one knows you are a dog. The reality is that you can be sitting at home or in your office and dealing with a company or a person thousands of miles away who has no concept of whom they are dealing with. This is not traditional commerce where you have clients whom you know well who come into your shop or who ring you over the phone and may have a personal relationship with your salesman or with the company at large. This is an entirely anonymous system of electronic commerce where people from anywhere around the world on a one-off basis can deal with your company or with you as an individual, and it is very difficult for you to establish their bona fides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Barriers which are put in the way of that, though, will severely cripple the international and reliable nature of that commerce. If people have the ability through strong encryption to work out that the person whom they are dealing with is exactly that person and no other person, then of course that enhances the prospects for electronic commerce.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10843">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is encryption important there? Encryption does two things. It not only provides secure communications&mdash;that is the obvious and important aspect of cryptography that we are all familiar with; it also allows you in an entirely separate way to identify people. If we have a system of public and private key cryptography, which is the one widely used throughout the developed world at the moment, the system provides a basis for you to understand that the person you are dealing with is the very person you know their public key represents them to be. If they are not, then the communication will not be able to be decrypted by the public key that that person has published. That is a very important issue in electronic commerce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commerce generally rests on identity. If there is no individual, if there is no I in commerce, then you cannot safely conduct trade with that person; you cannot have a person to own the goods or buy the services; and you will be unable to sue for payment; you will be unable to validate the contract; you will be unable to establish beyond any doubt that the person who communicated with you is liable for that payment, is liable for that contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So strong encryption permits not only security of communication; it also permits non&hyphen;repudiation. It permits a legal basis of identification which is certain in law and certain in fact. If we move to a situation where everyone is aware that law enforcement agencies have access to the keys to the encrypted data, then it is quite clear that other people could steal those keys, other people could represent themselves falsely to be the person that they allege they are dealing with. And of course that would undermine the certainty, it would undermine non&hyphen;repudiation, it would undermine the very basis of electronic commerce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are complex issues but ones which I think the parliament needs to come to grips with if it is to understand a very fundamental part of commerce in the 21st century. Australia has failed to develop policies surrounding this. We now have a minister for the information economy. Coincidentally, he is the minister for communications. That is an important link.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is also responsible for interception traffic, and you would expect that a minister who is responsible for both areas here would have it within his capacity to produce a sound and sustainable policy for electronic commerce which incorporated strong encryption as a fundamental cornerstone. And that balance has not been struck in this legislation. This is simply&mdash;and I think the minister's own speech indicates this&mdash;a linear progression from past days where all that mattered was the ability to intercept telephone conversations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have moved beyond that and, instead of taking the legislation to a new paradigm, instead of having policies which address those important issues, the minister has simply advanced past telecommunications interception legislation in a linear fashion to account for new technologies such as digital mobile phones, but not in a way which addresses this fundamental and rapidly rising issue of electronic commerce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Internet service providers and those who provide secure networks are going to have the obligation on them to provide decrypted data to agencies on demand, then no&hyphen;one will be able to rely on the certainty which they have previously been able to provide. The kind of encryption which is readily available in this country now is some 40&hyphen;bit encryption. The American munitions export control regulations prohibit the export from the United States of stronger encryption than that and, unfortunately, 40&hyphen;bit&mdash;or thereabouts&mdash;encryption is no longer particularly secure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, only in recent months groups in the United States operating through university computers have been able to decrypt messages which were so encrypted, and they have done it in a matter of hours. I think that 3&half; hours was all it took them to decrypt the message, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10844"> which was the test message, if you like. The message they decrypted is significant, because it said, `It's time we moved to stronger encryption.' And that is indeed the very point I want to make. If we can break that kind of encryption in 3&half; hours, then people will not have the confidence&mdash;nor should they have the confidence&mdash;in those systems. It is only if we have systems which are substantially secure against any rational attack&mdash;that is, 128&hyphen;bit encryption&mdash;that we will have a proposition which is defensible for the public, for commerce, and in a way which people can take account of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that has implications for law enforcement. I do not back away from that, but the reality is that we cannot allow law enforcement issues&mdash;for a small percentage of the community who undertake criminal activity&mdash;to hold back the 98 per cent of the community who are honest and law abiding and who wish to advance Australia's commercial interests in the world. That is far too important an interest for the whole of the population. A small group of people who are bent towards criminal activities cannot be allowed to prevent the rest of the community from embarking upon those interests. We often have to make trade&hyphen;offs between law enforcement and personal rights of privacy and security, but in this case there is no public debate about those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the government resisted every attempt to release the report by Walsh in 1996 on encryption policy in Australia. The government refused to release that report until a freedom of information request was made. Until the government finally honoured that request, we did not have access to that policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy made it very clear that there should not be further strengthening of laws against encryption in this country without adequate public debate, yet the government has not sought to advance that debate in any way. Indeed, it is progressing the legislation in a subtle, almost quiet fashion, avoiding the public debate on this issue which we should reasonably have by including this legislation in the basic telecommunications legislation which we have always supported in this parliament. This policy should be highlighted in a separate piece of legislation which deals with encryption and electronic commerce so that the public can debate these issues sensibly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just criminals who use secure communications. The reality is that business and individuals have every right to secure business and personal communication; they have every right to conduct electronic funds transfers, financial transactions and home banking in a way which is secure and private to them. They have the right to communicate their trade secrets and contractual data over networks which are secure and on which they can rely to know they are dealing with the individuals they say they are dealing with. They have the right to have crucial infrastructure such as air traffic control and the power grid. All of those things are now very important to our society and, if they cannot be protected by secure networks and if we cannot have confidence in those networks, then certainly Australia's growth is undermined. They have the right to have health records, their personal files and sensitive personal data protected by secure encryption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Computers are a very important way of transmitting and securing data. They are vital to government and business in pursuit of commerce and public policy. But, also, individuals and agencies have the right to secure data from inspection and false use by people who might wish to misuse it. Just as there is a law enforcement interest in eavesdropping on some conversations and some data traffic, so there is a law enforcement interest in protecting our health records, our power grid, our telephone network and our banks and electronic funds transfers from attack 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10845"> by those who seek to steal or misuse that data. Those things are criminal as well. Encryption will prevent that kind of attack on those very sensitive and important commercial and private institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So encryption serves both purposes and, like many things in our society, we have to strike a balance and come to a public understanding, a social contract, about what sacrifices of personal privacy and network security we will allow to occur. Indeed this government has, critically, failed to introduce that debate. Critically, it has failed to highlight those issues in this legislation. It is very much failing the public and business in this country by refusing to participate in international efforts to mandate privacy legislation to ensure that people have those rights, and that those rights are protected, both in law and in technical terms, through the use of encryption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those Internet service providers in the community who have established their businesses and who are promoting their business on the basis of their ability to deliver a secure network have the right to know that this government will have policies which support their role in the community, not policies which undermine them. At the moment I am afraid all the legislation we see here today and the lack of government initiative in this area indicate to me that the government is not about to support business and private individuals in their pursuit of that kind of cryptographic security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many issues which we could raise in relation to that, but I think they could more adequately be covered in a wide&hyphen;ranging inquiry by one of the committees of the House of Representatives. It is for that reason I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not opposing the measure, the House is of the view that the bill should be referred to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology so that a public inquiry can be conducted by the Committee and the House given the benefit of the committee's advice on the effect of the bill on the future development of electronic commerce in Australia with particular reference to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the development of an encryption policy that promotes public and business confidence in the security of financial transactions conducted electronically;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the requirement for secure digital signatures;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the impact on business of the Government's failure to support legally binding privacy standards for Australian companies.".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All of those issues are very sensitive. They are issues which could feasibly be bipartisan, and I would support such a move. But for that to occur, the government needs to have a proper public and open inquiry and discussion of these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things are no longer just the province of the national security agencies. They are no longer just the province of the law enforcement agencies. There is a temptation to view cryptography simply as something  which is enjoyed by the spooks and the National Security Agency in the bowels of its Fort Meade headquarters outside Washington DC, wherein resides, we are told, some of the world's best computers for breaking code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not something to be kept in the dark like that. This is something which now needs to be in the open. There is now a significant public interest in having an open and full debate about that and reaching conclusions on that trade-off between security of commerce, security of identity, guarantees of non-repudiation and the availability of billions of dollars in trade in electronic commerce in the next century. Those are the things we need to debate and offset against the need for law enforcement agencies to tap some communications.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10846">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I also advance the view that, if we seriously believe that those who engage in international terrorism and that those who engage in international drug trafficking will choose to use cryptographic products which they know the government has backdoor keys to, then I suggest we are fooling ourselves. We will always catch those at the bottom end of these trades through their use of ordinary phones and insecure communication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite feasible now to download from the Internet very strong encryption products which you can use. There are hundreds of cryptographic products available for commercial purchase and others which are simply given away by those who believe in the freedom of communication and in the secure nature of communication. Those products are readily available. If we believe that those who wish to engage in international criminal and other activity will use products that they know the government has a ready access to, then we are certainly deluding ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an area where ordinary citizens and ordinary businesses should be allowed to benefit from the rapid advances in technology. Unfortunately, this government is not laying the framework for it. So while we as an opposition do not oppose the fundamental nature of this bill for what it deals with on the face of it, we certainly demand that the government come forward with policies in this area which will support community confidence in electronic commerce and which will provide a sound framework for people to build their investments, their networks and their personal business around in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's place in the world and in the region in electronic commerce will depend on the government's ability to do this in the next couple of years. Any longer and the opportunities will be lost. We do not want to see those opportunities lost. I only hope the government can learn that lesson in time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I first came to this House not 18 months ago my office had a hot paper fax and a 386 computer. That was the previous government's dedication to this industry. Today, we have the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) getting up and proposing this second reading amendment. One part of the amendment is to refer the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S145">Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  to a standing committee. In light of that proposal, I would like to quote our honourable Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) from his response on the fair trading report. He said something that is equally applicable today:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's approach was to raise small business hopes by promising reviews, reports and recommendations only to have those hopes dashed by inaction, by reports shelved, recommendations ignored and issues deferred to the too&hyphen;hard basket.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all, 17 fair trading reports, reviews or draft proposals and 13 years of Labor. Nothing achieved.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was life for small business under Labor, where Hawke&hyphen;Keating cabinets rolled small business every time because they never really understood the non&hyphen;unionised small business community in Australia. It is laughable that Labor would now have you believe that they suddenly care about this and want to act. That is exactly the same in terms of information technology and small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Bonython spent the majority of his speech addressing encryption devices. The point of this legislation&mdash;and I think he missed it completely&mdash;is that the carrier will provide the information to our policing services in the form that it is transmitted. It is then up to those agencies to decode that. That is something that has been going on in this world since radio first went to air in the First World War, and in the Second World War; we have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10847"> been coding and decoding and competing, in a defence sense, with that sort of technology. That sort of encryption and decryption will carry on and is quite separate from this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about the ability to intercept what is, in fact, transmitted in the form that it is transmitted. The agencies that we are talking about are: the Australian Federal Police; a police force or service of a state or territory; the National Crime Authority; the New South Wales Crimes Commission; the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales; the Criminal Justice Commission of Queensland; the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation; the Police Integrity Commission; and a prescribed authority established by or under a law of the Commonwealth, a state or territory. We are talking crime; he wants to raise trade&hyphen;offs between personal privacy and the public benefit of apprehending crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was quite obvious in their responses to our efforts in terms of the drugs task force that they do not understand how criminal apprehensions occur today. It is generally a tip&hyphen;off, and you generally catch the trading in money&mdash;the financial transactions. It is very hard, in terms of organised crime, to launder those  amounts of money that we are talking about. That is where this sort of surveillance, this sort of capability with our policing service, is absolutely essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill needs to go ahead. It is actually transferring the costs of those telecommunications devices, or the gathering of the information, to the carriers and the end users. That is in line with our user&hyphen;pays principle. Given where this industry is going, if we left that with government the costs would be exponential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think you can really understand this bill unless you have some vision as to what Australia will look like in the future. In the future we will have a focus on the Internet. You will be able to trade stocks on the Internet; you will be able to look up the current price in the stock market immediately, as you already can; banking will be occurring over the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is education: you can get a master's degree on&hyphen;line&mdash;a master of professional accounting straight away at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> page on the Internet. You can submit papers for marking, you can e&hyphen;mail, you can get into chat shops and you can have tutorials. It really can all happen in the virtual world. So you get education. You have got EFTPOS transactions and smartcards. That sort of technology is coming up on us very quickly. You can do your shopping via the Internet. You can download music and videos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Video clips will not be just a little curiosity on an Internet site, they are going to be the whole video. If video store providers are not watching out for the future of their businesses they are going to be caught on the hop the same way that camera shops that did not stock the digital camera were caught out. Today, with the lifestyle of people moving in such a direction so fast, businesses must keep up with what is happening in their industry and how it will affect them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very good case is the Encyclopedia Britannica. An excellent article on this was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harvard Business Review</EMPHASIS>. The people at Encyclopedia Britannica looked at Microsoft Encarta and they saw it as a toy. They did not see what Microsoft Encarta meant to Encyclopedia Britannica and, consequently, their business went downhill until they quickly switched to that technology and came up with Britannica CD. That was a rescue mission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If businesses do not see what this is going to mean to their businesses then they should not stay in their holes, with Labor, seeking protectionism and saying, `Government, save me. Let's send it to review and let's keep things the same. Let's not change anything because government is going to save me.' I am sorry, the technological world does not work like that. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10848"> Our government has ministers and a Prime Minister who know where this industry is going. They are on the ball and are making an effort now, not only with this piece of legislation but also with calls for submissions into improving business to government interaction for regulatory and compliance purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That process is coming up with a proposal where businesses, via the Internet, can access government to register business names, to deal with the tax department, to link through to the industrial relations boards, to link back to social security payments and child support payments, to link through to garnisheeing wages and link back to pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be possible in the future for someone in Australia, via the remote control on their digital TV, to link up via a video link to their social security provider, answer questions, make any changes to their status, change their pension rate and be paid automatically, and then spend that money by electronic bill paying or by shopping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are watching ads on TV you can almost press a button on your remote control and download how much that particular item will cost, where it is available closest to you, who has it in stock, how many are left, and who is running a sale this week. And, you can probably then order it and have it home delivered. The Internet is going to become an integral part of our lifestyle. It is going to be like the telephone and the TV.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are going to see businesses that are no longer hierarchical in structure where the CEO has all the information. You are going to be dealing with businesses&mdash;and again I refer to that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harvard Business Review</EMPHASIS> article&mdash;that are integrated. Companies will have interconnectivity. Everybody will have all the information on that business. You will be getting companies with a very flat business structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will be able to do a lot more. It does not mean a loss of jobs, and that is something Labor always jumps up about and says, `Oh, but jobs, jobs, jobs.' It means you can be more efficient, you can do more. I know that if I had this technology now, today, in my office, rather than in two years time, my office would be three times more productive.</PARA>

If you want to put your head in the sand and say, `It is not going to affect me,' you are ignoring reality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was much to our cost that Labor delayed addressing these issues, and it is about time that something occurred. We were swept into government with such a mandate because we have a leader who can see this. He was talking with Intel just yesterday about getting some sort of investment infrastructure into this country where we will see the clustering of this sort of technology occurring.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10849">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing you will notice in the industry terminology is scaleability. The cost of ownership is coming down and it will be in every home. We are now getting connectivity speed through optic fibres. The roll out of all of this cable is all about getting connectivity speed into people's homes to support this type of transaction of the future. Business could see it but the previous government could not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that speed of technology, we need to be churning this legislation through very rapidly to give our law enforcement agencies the ability to keep up. They were already left in the dark ages by Labor. Do not let us refer this to some committee and delay it for another 18 months so that when we come back the criminals have got away with another $5 million haul of heroin and have laundered all the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are even seeing a situation now where we are addressing rural Australia: we are carrying this technology out into rural Australia. For a nation like Australia that is incredibly important. Finally we have a government with vision, a government that knows that we can use this technology. In fact, Australia is best placed in the world to be doing this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that Bill Gates is continually pushing and searching for is simplicity. We are looking at voice recognition capabilities. You will be able to dictate letters and open your e&hyphen;mail by voice command. You can listen to it and then reply to it. You can take a little hand&hyphen;held device, a pocket notebook, with you and download your schedule on it&mdash;your messages, notepads, shopping lists&mdash;and away you go. You can link up via wireless technology while you are out so that you can update whatever it is you had to do. You are organised. You are talking a lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implication for government is incredible. If we got this technology into every home, we could almost hold a referendum on every issue instantaneously&mdash;as if government would not be worried about that! It is a matter of having a government with a vision that can see where this is going. People will be able to keep personal photos, play video games, get an education, grab information, stay in touch with friends or just organise things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, I run programs called Tracker and Quicken but all of these are coming together on a great little program that Microsoft has come up with called Intellimirror. You will have information stored on the Net and, when you want to use it, you just download the software to play it. You will no longer have to upgrade your software every time. At the moment, if you want to upgrade your software, you have to save the data, load the next upgrade and then reconfigure it to the little icons that you like. Now you can have that done for you, automatically, instantaneously, by a little box on top of the television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact that this has for personal information is incredible, and they are worried about privacy! It astounds me. They have no idea, no concept of what this means to the future of the world, to the future of this country. Privacy! Sending an e&hyphen;mail today is like using an analog phone, and people know that, users know that. We are ahead of the Labor Party there. This is not about privacy. It is not about encryption devices&mdash;I mean, you can use all of those codes. The Internet is already getting very secure in terms of doing financial transactions. You are looking at major organised crime where you have to spend the bucks to decrypt this information, to use it and to track it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you now that the agencies listed in here do not have the resources or the time to go chasing after little Miss Smith's shopping list. I think that is perfectly safe. If Labor is alleging that organisations such as the Australian Tax Office and the Department of Social 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10850"> Security will abuse the information that is given to them in the electronic age, I think they have more to answer for regarding the downloading of DAS tapes&mdash;travelgate&mdash;than we do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are running in a world that is going incredibly fast. We are talking about seeing, within the next two years, this sort of technology in everyone's home, on everybody's person. Look at the rate at which Australia absorbed the mobile phone. And it does not matter which language you are using. It really is becoming the very simplest thing for people to adopt and use this technology. The government is talking about providing the budget savings to come up with this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that we keep up with the International Law Enforcement Telecommunications Seminar, which we are an active player in and which has come up with the international user requirements. In the future, this sort of interception device will be available in the switching devices for electronics. I do not know if anyone here saw the latest gun, like a Phalanx, which can send a million rounds a minute. It is all done in the circuitry, on that little switchboard. Your mobile phone, your PBX systems, everything is coming down to switching.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have in my electorate one of the Utilux group companies, which employs 500 people making these sorts of switches. They make them for everything. It is companies with that sort of manufacturing ability that have the ability to put in a generic interception device, which reduces the cost of this. That is why we are going with the ILETS and the IUR. It is perhaps the only cost&hyphen;effective way of managing the situation and keeping up with our law enforcement obligations to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that we are supporting those sorts of industries and those sorts of manufactures here in Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is already considering a holistic view of this technology in terms of the manufacture of switching here in Australia, the manufacturing of the appliances that go on top of that switching&mdash;the plastics, the tooling, whatever Intel is producing&mdash;and everything that flows from that, right through to the actual net, be it an intranet, the corporate net, or the Internet, and right down to the content on it. Pornography is something that we will have to monitor. I think it is severely in the public interest that we have some sort of interception ability to monitor that sort of transmission over the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of keeping up with technology. We are doing that&mdash;as fast as we can, but technology is even faster. But thank goodness we have got this government. I certainly would not want to be facing the next 10 years with Labor, who sit there and are worried about things that are not even the issue&mdash;who miss the point completely, who have no idea of what this can do in terms of productivity and the future lifestyles of Australians. After coming out of Defence 18 months ago, to walk into an office with a hot paper fax and a 386 computer: this was the government that Labor was running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments are ludicrous. They show a complete lack of understanding of this technology. The bill as proposed goes some way, but obviously as technology changes we will have to respond quickly and keep reviewing our legislation. We have the ministers in place who can do that. We have the Prime Minister with a vision of what Australia is going to look like. At least somebody in this country knows how Australians will be living in the year 2010. Thank goodness we have somebody who is actively bringing all of these things together through his office of government information, through his outsourcing of IT, through his support of local service providers, manufacturers and software companies. Those industries 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10851"> are where the jobs growth has happened in America and in Japan. In 20 years of protectionism under Labor, still the number of agricultural workers went down; the number of manufacturers in automotive industries went down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Electronics is the name of the game. If we do not do it well, if we do not have a strong industry like that here in Australia, then we may as well close up shop and resign ourselves to never again making it back into the top 10 of the OECD nations, where we were when Labor was in power. That is our goal. We have a Prime Minister who is taking us there. He is talking to the right multinationals. He is looking after this country in a way that Labor never could or never would.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S145">Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  provides for new interception capabilities and funding for those capabilities. Let me say at the outset that Labor supports the execution of legitimate investigation and the necessity for telecommunications interception to achieve this end. There have been some rather fatuous suggestions to the contrary. It has been made clear by the mover of the amendment that we do support the execution of legitimate investigation and the necessity for telecommunications interception. That is very clear. What we are going to, however, are some unforseen implications of the legislation currently before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent revelations by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper about the legitimacy of some interceptions do raise real concerns in the community about whether investigations are always legitimate; however, that is a separate debate from this one. It is interesting to note that the vast majority of intercepts under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act are related to drugs and not to murder or fraud. For the year ending June 1996 there were 216 taps for drugs and 15 for every other type of crime put together.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the emphasis of agencies, in what they use taps for, is on drug related crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New technology and the deregulation of the telecommunications industry introduce for policing some new challenges that must be fully considered. I do not believe those implications have been as fully considered in this legislation as they ought, and that is what I intend to address in this speech. As I said, the bill responds partly to the effects of deregulation upon the cost&hyphen;effectiveness of interception. Naturally, as you deregulate and there are multiple carriers, it becomes more expensive to endeavour to intercept communications through those carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill demands that carriers must ensure that communications passing over their network can be intercepted in accordance with a warrant issued under the act. Then there are all those sorts of underlying international memoranda that go to the capacity to understand what is communicated over those networks. Some communications that we have talked about this morning are, of course, encrypted. The functioning of the modern domestic and global economy is predicated on secure communications. We do not have, any more, the world where trucks were loaded up with buckets full of cash to go and pay people, nor do we have truckloads of cash that go to effect major financial interactions. It is all electronic, and those electronic transactions and the local and global economies themselves are predicated on secure communications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No financial institution, market or business would be reliable if secure electronic communications were unavailable. The implication of the legislation is that network providers, such as financial institutions and Internet service providers, may be required to provide access not only to the encrypted data packets themselves but also to the decrypted data itself. That 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10852"> is what is not clear in this legislation, and that primarily is what requires us to refer this to committee, to explore the implications of what is proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If what is proposed is that providers need essentially to provide the data decrypted, then we have a range of serious difficulties on our hands. It is a bit like the Stasi opposition to the invention of the photocopier, whereby they did not want people to have photocopiers on the basis that they might photocopy ideas and distribute them. There are some curious parallels with the introduction of older technology. What is being sought in terms of network providers providing decrypted packets to agencies could be achieved essentially in two ways. One is that backdoor decryption keys or master keys are made available so that agencies can essentially read the contents of packets that are transmitted over the networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this approach is that it is essentially not possible to provide backdoor keys for technology involving public and private key approaches. That is, those technologies, such as PGP, have a public key and a private key, where the interaction of the two electronic keys enables the algorithm to decrypt the content of the message that has been encrypted. Some will use only that private key/public key approach for that specific reason because it is not capable of having a master key to unlock what the user wants to be a private interaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other complication is that the ISP&mdash;Internet service providers&mdash;really have no way of knowing or controlling what the users send or receive, or what client programs are used by the user. So, essentially, it would be extremely difficult for those ISPs to comply with the requirement implied in this legislation that they are able to furnish agencies with the decrypted data. I will talk about the implications this has for commercialisation for the Internet in a moment. But first I will talk about the second option which is available to ISP and financial institutions to allow essentially weak encryption products on the market, or to allow the use of only those weaker encryption products so as to enable agencies to decrypt the contents of particular packets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only approach would be using the sort of 40-bit key approach which the Americans have allowed for export. They will allow a better key internally but they will not allow firms to export anything more than, I think, 40 bits. You can download from a range of sites in Europe much more sophisticated public key/private key encryption products. It is pretty easy if you want to secure for yourself an encryption product which agencies would have some difficulty in dealing with. We are not really talking about locking away the photocopier so that people cannot exchange information&mdash;as the Stasi would have wanted us to do in earlier decades. We are talking about technology being available for those people who really want to use it. But there is a lack of technology for legitimate users, such as Joe Blow citizen, who wants to use reliable encryption to relay his credit card details over an unsecured network. That capacity is not available internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of studies, including those conducted by Belcore and the Weisman institute, show that 40-bit keys are wholly unreliable. Students at MIT&mdash;which was mentioned earlier&mdash;showed that information encrypted with this standard can be decrypted in a matter of hours. Yet this is the standard that the United States has essentially locked Australia into supporting for international encryption on the Net. They will not let us export reliable encryption products to deal with the lack of consumer confidence in using credit card details on the Net, and that is causing us a real problem. Consumers know that their activity on the Net can be intercepted. In fact, we are essentially reminded of it every time we use one of the more popular browsers, like Netscape or Explorer, where we are given a little prompt saying, `You are about to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10853"> transmit some information over an insecure network. Do you really want to do that?' Every consumer on the Internet is reminded every time he or she uses the Internet that they are using an unreliable network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implications that has for commercialisation of the Internet are profound. People who are concerned about the very real prospect of the misuse of their credit card details are not prepared to disclose their credit card details on the Net. That means that we are retarding the Australian domestic take up or commercialisation of the Net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also retarding the capacity for domestic firms to trade internationally with larger markets for that reason. Essentially, the Americans have locked up their market for those people who are concerned about releasing their credit card details. They are essentially locking them out of trading with Australian firms and locking them into trading with American firms because they can use reliable encryption to transmit their credit card details and the like with an American firm, but they are prohibited from using a reliable encryption product to transmit their credit card details to an Australian firm. America is a larger market than Australia. So the net loser in this arrangement is Australia, not America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been endeavours by local firms to address the problem but they have been blocked. For example, there is a company in Sydney called Nexus Solutions&mdash;it is a small start-up. It developed a 448&hyphen;bit key encryption product which the Office of Defence Signals Directorate refused to let them export. They won a major site licence with the World Health Organisation, but because we are locked into an arrangement with the Americans that says that we are not allowed to export reliable encryption products, we could not let them export that product to the World Health Organisation. That gives rise to all sorts of speculation about why the heck Australian intelligence organisations might be interested in the internal e&hyphen;mails of the World Health Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We essentially have here, I would posit, some unforeseen circumstances presented by this legislation. If the legislation is talking about access to packets per se, whether decrypted or encrypted, the government needs to explicitly make that clear in this legislation, which it has not yet done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of making that clear, it needs to be referred to committee so that those issues can be explored and resolved. This is not, as the previous speaker, the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) would have it, a troglodyte approach or a point scoring approach. This is about ensuring that both the national and private interest are served. If we can ensure that organisations which have a legitimate interest in or a legitimate activity in intercepting data are able to go about their business and do so effectively&mdash;and cost&hyphen;effectively as well&mdash;then all well and good. But if we are talking about expecting ISPs to deliver up the impossible, such as decryption products and the like for agencies, then we have a whole range of other difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wrapped up in this debate is the real concern that consumers have about the insecurity of the Net. It is often publicised that some young Net nerd, with a reasonable command of UNIX, will pipe out someone else's transaction to their terminal and they will have access to the contents of e&hyphen;mails and all the rest of it. As long as that concern is there and legitimate, Australian firms are disadvantaged. I would not have thought it is in the interest of either the opposition or the government to see that disadvantage perpetuated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In seconding the amendment, what I am seeking to do is to suggest to the government that the implication of this legislation is not quite as simple as the previous speaker would have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10854"> it. Yes, the Internet is an exciting and cute sort of place, but there are some very serious things that are going on in terms of the future of the Australian national economic interest which this bill impinges upon.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S145">Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  before us today handles the technology which is required from time to time for law enforcement agencies to intercept telephone calls, telecommunication transactions, perhaps even the Internet or whatever might be necessary for them to detect and gather evidence relating to criminal activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of speakers have contributed to this debate so far, raising matters which are probably better addressed through legal and constitutional attorneys&hyphen;general committees of this parliament and which really do overexaggerate this bill's particular role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is certainly concerned about the technology and access to the technology that is required by law enforcement officials. But how that particular technology is used is a completely separate matter and how an investigation is commenced and what is a legitimate investigation is a completely separate matter. I would like to come back to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interception of communications between two people, two parties, two businesses, two sides of a war or two battalions on the one side has really been a matter ever since somebody trained eagles to intercept carrier pigeons. It has really been something that has occurred ever since man&mdash;in a generic sense, not a sexist sense&mdash;used any particular implement to scratch some words on paper or papyrus, or whatever, and sent it off to somebody else. So let's get to what this bill is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1997  is going to apply the new arrangements to procedures that are necessary to ensure there are ongoing and up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date interception capabilities of telecommunications services in Australia and also to fund this particular interception capability. There are a number of minor technical amendments to the Telecommunications Act involving industry development plans and labelling of equipment and also the requirement of the Australian Communications Authority to convene and obtain industry reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is going to tighten up a number of arrangements that govern the interception of telecommunication services so they are, in fact, keeping pace with the digital age. As technology expands and grows in this  country&mdash;and we have heard plenty of contributions about that today&mdash;it is important that law enforcement agencies, if and when it is determined by the proper authorities, must be able to keep pace with those changes and must be able, if and whenever necessary, to intercept transactions or communications involving that new technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is vital that police and security organisations are able, on occasions, to intercept people's calls conducted on carriers' networks. With the multitude of carriers now coming on stream in the new technological and telecommunications revolution that is in this country, inspired by Minister Alston, it is vital that we have in place legislation which is relevant, legislation which has built into it the ability to conduct reports, to order reports, to ensure that we are always up to date. The existing arrangements are just simply no longer up to date. In fact, there have been services that have been introduced on occasions without any adequate interception capability and these are starting to impact adversely on the operations of law enforcement and national security agencies.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10855">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that speaking on a digital mobile phone&mdash;and I know that, in your particular electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, you are perhaps not so blessed with this brain&hyphen;searing technology&mdash;is supposedly far more secure, as conversations between two digital mobile phones cannot be easily detected, or it is, I believe, virtually impossible under current arrangements. These sorts of matters are, of course, a concern where there are illegal activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems will not go away under the current framework. As well, opening up the market to full competition has increased the range of difficulties and, of course, the expense faced by various agencies that are attempting interception capability arrangements with each and every new entrant. There needs to be in place a standard approach for these new entrants to ensure that the equipment they install and the technology they embrace to offer the services that they do to the consumers of those services have a sympathetic treatment of the possible need for interception of those calls and transactions over their networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is all about getting the various vendors of telecommunications to cooperate in a cost&hyphen;effective interception capability way. A lot of that will come through international cooperation in the longer term. We need to get telecommunications equipment vendors, especially people who manufacture switching equipment, for instance, to include some common interception capabilities into their equipment. We need to ensure that those capabilities are maintained. We need to ensure costs are kept down by sharing them amongst all user countries, and that will help achieve economies of scale. So this bill provides for a new level of interception capability based upon relevant international standards and guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of this technology is not an area that the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) is going to arbitrate on on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis. Rather, the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) and other proper people in law authority in this country are, of course, going to look at the specifics of the applications of these particular technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General, of course, will also base some of the requirements that he would have as the chief law officer of this land on the international user requirement, IUR, developed by most OECD law enforcement and national security agencies, which includes this country, under the auspices of the International Law Enforcement Telecommunications Seminar, ILETS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also contains, as have a number of other bills that Minister Alston has introduced into the parliament during his time as minister for communications, mechanisms which will ensure that we can constantly keep ourselves up to date. It will require the ACA to be notified of any relevant changes to technology and it will require that relevant agencies are consulted by the ACA. This is a good thing. It is important in this ever changing technological world in which we live, as gimmicks come and gimmicks go but as some things become hard and fast mainstays and must haves of our economy and our community, that we keep up to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the criminal elements in this nation and in this world that will always keep themselves one step ahead of the law. If technology provides them with an escalator to keep one step ahead of the law then we have to respond. As legislators, not to stop them from doing that would be irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We may express some grave concerns, justifiably, about the privacy aspects for the bulk of the citizenry but I suspect that most Australians have absolutely nothing to fear from the enhanced interception capabilities that law enforcement agencies may have as a result of this bill passing. I say that simply because all we are doing is ensuring that the standard capabilities 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10856"> that law enforcement agencies have are able now to be executed through the new technologies. This is a reasonable, straightforward, easy to understand bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also looks at new funding arrangements for interception. Various agencies will continue to be liable for the cost of executing individual interception warrants as well as most other matters that are in addition to the basic listening and recording of a communication. They will also be liable for the cost of establishing capabilities that they have specifically requested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand a few of the communications carriers will probably be a bit miffed by this because a greater share of the costs of interception are being placed upon them than was previously the case. But these are the  carriers that are participating in a vigorous, growing industry, an industry where, as the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) said before, every year the cost seems to halve while the capability seems to double. It is an industry where there is exponential growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the take&hyphen;up of this industry, in a commercial sense, has meant that profits are substantial and potential profits are even greater. Therefore, it is quite fair and reasonable for the national good and for our role as a good international citizen for these telecommunications carriers to play their part in sharing some of the costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the interception capability plan, it is also wise that this bill requires that the Attorney&hyphen;General is able to nominate carriers and carriage service providers who are then required to submit plans on an annual basis to ensure that the Attorney&hyphen;General, as the chief law officer, is up to date with any technological changes which may occur from time to time and which may prevent him and his agencies from conducting the proper business that they do conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset of my contribution today, this bill is all about technology. It is all about ensuring that there is a certain amount of flexibility within the government and the law enforcement agencies, as well as within the industry, to comply in a good citizen sense with changing technology affecting interception capabilities. This bill is about ensuring they comply with the need to update our capabilities to intercept calls, intercept transactions of data, and intercept various things that criminals may embark upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, with regard to the moral issue&mdash;the civil liberty issue&mdash;I have a great deal of sympathy for that, and I think the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) and the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel) touched on elements of that. When I look at my own state, at the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland which is a law unto itself, I see that it has embarked on some very curious tapping of telephone conversations and, as a result, it has been found wanting, and quite rightly. I worry that there is always a question of ensuring that telephone interceptions and technological interceptions, when they take place, are done so for the right reasons. So I say let us give strength to the civil liberty groups and to the members of this place who always keep those particular decisions accountable. Let us make the people who make these decisions always accountable for them. But, in concert with making those particular decision makers accountable&mdash;those who decide to order these interception procedures&mdash;what we cannot do is tie one arm behind their back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been introduced because technology has been hamstringing law enforcement agencies for years now. It is important that this bill not only address the technological change in recent years and does something about it but also that it leaves open the door for future technology changes and allows the authorities, both in the communications area of this government and in the law enforcement areas, the flexibility they need.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10857">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we all want to see criminal elements rooted out. While we have heard contributions today about the concern of legitimate commercial transactions being encrypted&mdash;coded so that the transactions are protected from others who may accidentally or incidentally, or quite deliberately, obtain that data for their own commercial advantage&mdash;there is no doubt that the criminal element will also embark upon encryption of their own activities. Therefore, unless we allow law enforcement agencies the opportunity and the flexibility they need to keep up to date with technology to deal with the technological changes and to be able to intercept, if necessary, particular encoded information, we are doing the wrong thing by the citizenry of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this bill as it stands is a good bill. It is a straightforward bill. It provides the technological changes. As I said, for those who want to argue the moral questions, I do not believe the venue of this bill is the appropriate place to do that. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been described by the previous speaker, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S145">Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> was introduced in the Senate on 2 October. It passed the Senate on 30 October 1997 and entered the House in November. As I understand it, the bill is being unanimously supported subject to minor agreed Democrat amendments in the Senate. The intent of the bill is to create new arrangements for establishing interception capabilities for telecommunications services and for the funding of interception capabilities. It makes a number of minor technical amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interception of telecommunications services is an integral part of today's law enforcement work and has become an increasingly useful tool for this nation's security, intelligence and police forces. However, as the use of such interception has increased in importance, we have also seen a mammoth increase in the use of telecommunications services by business and other consumers, as well as a proliferation of new technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the extraordinary benefits these innovations have provided to us, as Australians, there have arisen some problems with the use of interception services. At present, law enforcement agencies are able to obtain information in connection with the investigation of certain offences by interception provided they have an appropriate warrant. Furthermore, as it presently stands, all telecommunication carriers are obliged to cooperate with agencies by ensuring that all communications on their service can be intercepted by authorised agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This requirement is subject to exemptions granted by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) in consultation with the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams). Carriers are  also obliged to consult with agencies, as directed by the Australian Communications Authority, about the development of new telecommunications technologies. This is an obvious requirement because of the need to ensure that new servers are able to be intercepted in the interest of law enforcement, public safety and national security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, with the deregulation of the Australian telecommunications industry this year it has become apparent that all new carriers entering the market must painstakingly negotiate these arrangements with the relevant agencies. In short, everyone stands to lose&mdash;the agencies, because their resources are tied up in these negotiations, and consequently the people of Australia; the carriers, who lose valuable time and money when they get caught up in this process, and, as a consequence, their customers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10858">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already the introduction of some new telecommunications services has been significantly delayed. Other services have occasionally been introduced without adequate allowance for  interception use. Thankfully, potential solutions to this predicament have already been canvassed by Mr Pat Barrett, in his 1994 report on telecommunications interception. In fact, many of his ideas were incorporated into the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Act passed in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most appropriate answer in the long run is to participate in internationally cooperative efforts to ensure the vendors of telecommunication services, particularly switch makers, include common interception capabilities in their equipment. Costs shared amongst nations are substantially reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation introduces a new level of interception capability based on these international considerations. More precisely, the Attorney&hyphen;General will base the new capability level on the international user requirement developed under the International Law Enforcement Telecommunications Seminar. To ensure continuous interception capability, this legislation allows for the continuation of present arrangements until the Attorney&hyphen;General has made his determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise also that law enforcement agencies are not simply interceptors of telecommunication services but also users of services. Their particular roles mean that they are often required to use services which are incapable of interception, or have a lower level of interception capability. Under this legislation, the minister&mdash;in consultation with the Attorney&hyphen;General&mdash;will continue to allow the operation of such services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to overcome the problems associated with carrier-agency consultation, the ACA will be consulted by carriers who change technologies and the ACA will then consult the relevant agencies. The ACA will be required to specify reasonable guidelines for agency considerations, to ensure that there is no undue delay of service introduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation aims also to overcome the funding problems associated with interception. In the past, these problems have severely impacted on the work of agencies. While those agencies will continue to be liable for the cost of executing individual warrants, carriers will be required to pay the costs of providing the relevant interception capability. The cost burden is therefore more equitably shared. There are a number of other changes made which will further strengthen the sharing of costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, there is a recognition that future consideration of these matters will be required. As such, the bill requires that the minister, in consultation again with the Attorney&hyphen;General, review&mdash;before 1 July 1999&mdash;longer&hyphen;term cost&hyphen;effectiveness in the funding of telecommunications interception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To touch on the comment by the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), I share that concern about the potential breach of civil rights and mischievous use of interception. I think we will need to be forever vigilant in that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rest of the bill simply deals with a number of other minor amendments&mdash;to labelling requirements for customer equipment and cabling, the reporting requirements of the ACA, the regulation of carriers' powers and immunities, and industry development plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With pleasure I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;We are now concluding the summing up of debate on the Telecommunications Legislation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10859"> Amendment Bill 1997. I take the opportunity to thank honourable members who have contributed to the discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is agreed to by the opposition, although I understand that there is a proposal that there be a division on its amendment. I will talk about that amendment. Under the procedures, I understand, the division will actually take place in the main chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to some of the matters that have been raised by the shadow minister for science, the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans). I acknowledge his level of interest in this area. He did indicate that he supported the basic thrust of the legislation, and the government is pleased about that. Both sides of the parliament recognise the basic importance of the information economy, but I think his summation of some of the issues relating to encryption missed the point of what the intent is with regard to this piece of legislation, which in the main could be described as reasonably complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government fundamentally agrees that electronic commerce is vitally important for the nation and we are indeed developing a range of approaches to this. The recent announcement by my colleague Senator Alston, as the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, gives effect to the concern in relation to this issue and to the importance that the government places on it. Indeed, the National Office of the Information Economy will focus on the issue of electronic commerce and will work closely with Australian business and relevant agencies to ensure that the broader issues raised by encryption, security and privacy issues, which I will discuss in a moment, are addressed in encouraging the overall development of electronic commerce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister misses the point. It is not true that the act fails to adequately address the information economy: that is clearly a red herring from the Labor Party, and that is regrettable. It is indeed important, in a national sense, to embrace across party lines the benefits that can accrue to our economy from developing a purposeful approach to the information economy, and the government is certainly committed to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contribution from the shadow minister fundamentally misreads part of the bill. What the bill requires is for carriers, including ISPs, to give information to the agencies&mdash;and the agencies I refer to are the security agencies&mdash;in the form in which they actually receive it. If the information comes onto an ISP or independent service provider network in an encrypted form, the ISP is merely obliged to deliver that information in the same encrypted form to those agencies. The bill is not, as I understand the shadow minister to have said, requiring those people to deal more substantially with that encrypted form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Referring the bill to a committee, as is the genus of the amendment, is not in our view appropriate. Indeed, I heard the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) eloquently outlining why it was not appropriate and certainly not a matter that ought to be sent to a committee. This legislation needs to be passed to enable the issues to proceed. As I outlined earlier, there is a cost consequence here. We do not want to limit in any way, by derailing and delaying this bill, the development of the emergence of service providers and the development of this industry&mdash;particularly when the Labor Party has already said it supports the general thrust of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is basically about the capacity of law enforcement agencies to carry out their tasks by ensuring that they have the resources to conduct interception of telecommunication services. We are all aware, in the broad, of the heavy reliance that individual communications have on utilising the telephone system and of the increasing capacity for and take&hyphen;up of digitisation, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10860"> both in the exchanges&mdash;and I referred in the second reading speech to the importance of switching points and, indeed, we have talked about that in some detail&mdash;and in mobile  telephony. They are, obviously, all matters which security agencies worldwide are dealing with. Indeed, I outlined some of the international arrangements in the second reading speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is not about the ability of business to conduct commercial transactions or digital signatures. Indeed, the matter of digital signatures, which I note is in the amendment, is not even mentioned in the bill. The shadow minister, whilst he does know a little about this area, would probably benefit from taking some more detailed briefings. With regard to the requirement for privacy standards on Australian companies, the encryption issues raised in the bill are implicit and secondary. They only arise where a telecommunications carrier or service provider does its own encryption as an inherent part of its service offering. The current position, which allows end users to encrypt information, does not change. There is no obligation on carriers or service providers to decrypt any encryption from an end user. As I mentioned before, digital signatures are not even mentioned in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important point has been made by some members, and I have just heard Mr Barry Wakelin, the member for Grey, make a reference to privacy, but the fundamental issue is that the bill does not change the privacy and protection of communications requirements imposed by the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 and part 13 of the Telecommunications Act 1997. Privacy is not in any way affected by this bill, and that matter needs to be underlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was reference to the Pat Barrett report of some years ago. Indeed, in another capacity as Telecommunications Ombudsman, I can testify that the development of a privacy regime and additional amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act underpin the commitment that we have across the community to ensuring that privacy is respected, both in legislation and in practice. I give the assurance that that legislation meets those requirements, so any suggestion to the contrary ought to be rejected. I say to my colleagues, on both sides of the chamber who participated in the debate, to please be assured on that particular point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final issue is that the parliament has already set up a forum for looking at electronic commerce issues. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts has commenced an inquiry into the issues surrounding all of these matters. This will certainly canvass the wider issues of the encryption policy. I understand that the committee will report on schedule, and that the report will be tabled in both houses between March and May next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also clearly contemplates an early review of its own policies before 1 July 1999. We will continue, as I mentioned, to give high priority to all of these matters but, clearly, it is inappropriate for the bill to be delayed. That is why we will vote against the amendment that is being proposed by the honourable shadow minister. We do not want to create uncertainty in the telecommunications industry&mdash;as I said in the second reading speech. We do not want to potentially create unnecessary problems for law enforcement or national security. We can give the assurance, which is already in the legislation to which I refer, about the protection of privacy matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation recognises the increasing complexity of technology and how it interfaces with law enforcement agencies. The bill, as I mentioned in the second reading speech, takes up a couple of other matters that are uncontentious and that need to be dealt with for the continued enhancement of a telecommunications policy&mdash;the benefit of which, in a tangential 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10861"> way, is illustrated with the listing of Telstra on the Stock Exchange for the first time. We have seen that happen with tremendous benefits for so many in the community, including over 90  per cent of Telstra employees who have done particularly well. This is a government that takes the development of telecommunications at a sensible pace for the benefit of all very seriously. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S144">Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</XREF>  seeks to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to give effect to decisions in respect of X and R&hyphen;rated programs on narrowcasting services which were included in a range of measures announced by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) and the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) on 8 April 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, X and R&hyphen;rated programming is banned on subscription broadcasting services and on free to air broadcasting services. However, narrowcasting services&mdash;that is, services limited in availability or appeal&mdash;are not prevented from providing X and R&hyphen;rated programming. Increasingly, pay television companies are offering extra channels of specialised programming through narrowcasting services. Such services provide pay television companies with an avenue to broadcast explicitly sexual material which mainstream television services are prohibited from showing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to considerable community concern, the government has decided to amend the Broadcasting Services Act to prohibit programs that have been refused classification or have been classified as X on subscription television narrowcasting services and also on open free to air narrowcasting services. This will serve to prohibit the depiction of actual sexual acts, as provided for under the current X classification, across all television services, whether broadcast or narrowcast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also decided to apply to open narrowcasting services the same restrictions regarding R&hyphen;rated programs as currently apply to commercial television broadcasting services. These include the requirement that codes of practice must provide for modification of R&hyphen;rated films to comply with the previous AO classification, and restrict the hours within which M and MA material may be broadcast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Typically, open narrowcasters are community television services provided free to air, and without any limitation on access by children. It is considered, therefore, that they should be subject to the same restrictions as apply to other free to air services in respect of the televising of R-rated material.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S144">Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</XREF>  amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to ensure that X&hyphen;rated material is not available on narrowcast services and R&hyphen;rated material is not available on open narrowcast services and is restricted to closed narrowcast services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Narrowcast services are divided into two categories, open and closed. Open narrowcast services constitute cable or other delivered services, on which no restrictions as to availability are placed. Examples of open  narrowcast service are community television stations and most pay TV channels. These services are readily accessible by children. Closed narrowcast services include restricted pay TV services. These services place controls over access to the services. An example of a closed narrowcast service is Galaxy's Night Moves channel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill ensures that open narrowcast services are treated the same as free to air television for classification purposes. The bill is consistent with previous decisions of the Labor Party when we were in government and decisions that we have made since we have been in opposition, and we will be supporting this unconditionally in the House. I do not believe that I should keep the committee any further. My view is to give credit where credit is due. This is a bill that does have cross-party support, and the Labor Party commends it to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too rise to support this <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S144">Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</XREF> . This bill is good commonsense and will ensure that reasonable standards are maintained in free to air in some cases of community narrowcasting TV services, and in certain areas of pay TV where some limitations continue to be placed on any specialist services relating to R&hyphen;rated movies and there is a voluntary ban on X-rated movies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill would certainly have the support of my electorate. In information that has been provided to us independently, I am pleased to say that the electorate of O'Connor has the lowest level of consumption of X&hyphen;rated videos out of Canberra of any electorate in Australia. That is just our good, healthy lifestyle. There are plenty of other activities of either a work or recreational nature in my electorate that remove the need for that sort of stimulation. That is just a point I make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would make at this stage&mdash;and I wish to take the opportunity of this particular debate to refer to a couple of matters relative to the other side of the question&mdash;is that the electorate of O'Connor does not get a great deal of cable or other types of television. In fact, without special facilities that I wish to refer to, it does not get much television at all. It has the choice presently, for most sectors, of an ABC program and a commercial program, known as GWN&mdash;that is the start and the finish of it&mdash;and for many to obtain either of those programs requires their own satellite communications equipment. So they have got a little way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that not long ago local government was running a very vigorous campaign against cables being strung around electric light poles. My 62 local authorities decided that they should be involved in this campaign and all wrote me letters saying what a dreadful thing it was. I wrote back to them all and said that I had good news for them: they were not getting any cables. I said it was about time they woke up to the fact that they were out in the cold when it came to cable television, and if somebody was prepared to come into their place and do them the favour of stringing a few cables around on their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10863"> electric light poles they ought to grab the opportunity because they were not getting anything else. Anyway, I think the logic of that might have prevailed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I wish to draw to the attention of the House&mdash;and it has a linkage here in as much as this has to do with regulating particularly cable and satellite services&mdash;circumstances arising in my electorate. The remote area broadcasting service, as it is known, does in fact include certain services in Queensland regional television. They are serviced by satellite, as I have already mentioned, and it has been the decision of the main two providers&mdash;that is, Optus and Telstra&mdash;to move their satellite transmission from analog to digital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a commercial decision they have made and it gives those transmitters substantial benefits. The first is that they can substantially expand the delivery capacity of existing satellites because they can get a lot more compressed information into the same units. That, on the other hand, will also allow them to provide a lot of other services, such as Internet services and all sorts of things of that nature, data transfer services and, of course, a wider variety of TV transmissions within the same capacity. That would be a benefit to the people in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The downside at the moment is that it requires a change of equipment which many of these people have only purchased recently, usually at a cost of about $4,000. It does not require the replacement of all that equipment. But to the best that I can establish&mdash;and this is an interesting point, because presently there are no so&hyphen;called black boxes commercially available&mdash;it is suggested that for a standard sort of farm equipment there will be a cost of about $1,200 for domestic decoders and costs of from $2,500 to $10,000 for professional model decoders, which may be required for those communities that have installed their own terrestrial retransmission facilities. That is not uncommon in my electorate where local authorities have put in a single receiving point and retransmitted it in the same fashion as would apply to people in major metropolitan areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issue in all of this is that, under Project Aurora, Optus is digitising its satellite operations and developing a system capable of carrying a range of services, including broadcasting, pay TV and data transfer services, including Internet access. They are doing that with their own satellites, which they purchased along with the licence to be our second electronic communicator. Telstra is offering a separate service using capacity on the PanAm satellite, but otherwise is doing the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC and SBS and regional television in Queensland have contracted with Optus for future digital transmission of their services. Optus is currently scheduled to begin conversion in Western Australia in May 1998. GWN, the commercial provider, has contracted with Telstra for transmission of its services in Western Australia commencing in November 1997. There is another remote area broadcasting service, a RABS operator, Imparja, and that is yet to finalise arrangements with respect to its services in central Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is confronting the people in my electorate is that if they want to continue to get the public and the commercial broadcasting service, as things stand now they will have to access two separate satellites in two separate parts of the spectrum. Technically this would require two dishes, or a much more expensive one that literally could track and locate the two satellites. That is much more expensive than a fixed dish and, in fact, is not a practical solution. As you can imagine, as a consequence there is considerable concern in my electorate over this arrangement.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10864">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem for the government is that in our presently deregulated and commercialised environment, this initiative is not a government initiative. We did not tell anybody to do this. We recognise that there is a long&hyphen;term benefit to everybody, but on the other hand it is a commercial decision taken by commercial communication providers and, as a consequence, commercial and public TV providers. They are making it very clear that they do not expect to accept the costs as they apply to the consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have suggested that there is a possibility that the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund, the RTIF&mdash;that is, if there are any funds left after Tasmania gets its share. I understand they are to be treated generously in this matter&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reality is that it has been suggested that it is appropriate that people apply to that fund. Although I can see that as a mechanism to save costs for my constituents, I must recognise that such a purpose is going to reduce the capacity of that fund to do other things that I think may be of more importance. That includes the extension of mobile phone services throughout my electorate, or assistance in allowing people to get into low orbiting satellite phones. Again, my electorate is one that is substantially underserviced when it comes to mobile phones, notwithstanding that it is a service that probably, if it had ever been provided on the basis of need, would have first gone to country areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am disappointed that the service providers do not seem to be looking at the options by which they could assist their own clients. These could include a bulk wholesale purchase of black box decoders and subsequently providing them at the imported price. That at least would incur no cost and would generate considerable savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, the issue of the two services is the one that concerns me most. I have had correspondence with the minister who unofficially tells me that they are negotiating to obtain approval from the two commercial satellite operators to retransmit each other's signal. That means that by tuning in to one satellite or the other you would be back to the current situation of only having to access one satellite. I am extremely hopeful that we will get the cooperation of Telstra and Optus in that regard. It would be most unfair to my constituents were it to be done in any other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That of course raises questions of capacities on the satellites, and it raises questions with some, which I cannot understand, that there could be some reduction in the quality through re&hyphen;broadcasting. I am not sure that that is technically correct. I take this opportunity in the parliament to draw these situations to the attention of the House because I believe it is unfair to the people in my electorate that, because they do not get free to air, as it is understood in major metropolitan areas&mdash;they have invested their own capital in obtaining something which people in the metropolitan area take for granted&mdash;they should be confronted, in the case of some, after quite recent substantial capital outlays, with this additional cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am hoping that the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston)&mdash;and I am not complaining about him because he has been very cooperative and very sensitive to this issue&mdash;will pursue it and that he will implement it to the extent he is able. For instance, as the major shareholder, still, in Telstra we could influence them to ensure we do get re&hyphen;transmission so that there need only be one communication. Also, every attempt should be made to reduce the costs to individuals, through the cost of either decoders or other equipment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10865">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that regard, I have recently had information of retailers whom I would like to criticise running around saying to people, `There's going to be a dreadful shortage of these decoders. Sign up for one now at $3,000.' In fact, the suggested price is $1,200. I find that outrageous. But it is happening and it is a great pity. They are people outside of this system. I put that on the record and hope that it is noted by these people because I think they are being very unfair to their customers in trying to market ahead of the situation. In fact, as I understand it, the black boxes are still not commercially available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your indulgence in allowing me to address those additional issues. It makes sense to control these particular transmissions and I think there is an ever rising expectation in the community that governments ensure that children and others are protected. I support the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments that have just been made by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who also supports the legislation, and his much broader comments about the needs of his electorate, which represents, in parts, a remote area of Australia, and their need for television services, and the utilisation of satellites operated by Optus and Telstra, are certainly noted. As he indicated, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) has been in communication with him and is well aware of the problems and the concerns that he has. It is no wonder that the member for O'Connor is one of the most successful members in the chamber, given the way he prosecutes the needs of his constituents, and we certainly congratulate him for that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the Family and Community Affairs Committee for its report on the seminar into aspects of youth suicide and the recommendations contained in the report. It is a timely report, something that quite clearly is critical, in view of the rising rate of youth suicide. It is another demonstration of how parliamentarians of all political persuasions can work together towards a common objective. Often we hear the complaint in the community that parliamentarians always seem to be squabbling and fighting over sometimes narrow political differences in the parliament. But in this particular instance we can see clearly demonstrated a common purpose on the part of parliamentarians who are quite clearly deeply concerned at what has become part and parcel of our modern&hyphen;day life, the rising rate of youth suicide. I might say also that another aspect of suicide is the rising and very high rate of suicide amongst men who are in the aged bracket.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where, to use Hugh Mackay's definition of the three generations that has been most recently expounded in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Generations: Baby Boomers, their Parents and their Children</EMPHASIS>, which was released very recently, we can see suicide affecting the two generations on either side of the baby boomers. That is an interesting phenomenon, given some of the comments that have been made in this book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hugh Mackay calls the generation that followed the baby boomers, the ones who are in the age group where we have youth suicide so prevalent, the `options generation'. Talking about the changes in the community, he made the point:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to evolutionary psychology, the process of adapting from village life to suburban life has been so disruptive to the human psyche that it will be many more generations before adaptation successfully occurs. In the meantime, the theory claims to account for widespread feelings of alienation, depression and other neuroses amongst the suburban population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If that theory were to be our framework, we might expect that the Options Generation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the generation following the baby boomers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would be showing the healthiest signs of successful adaptation, and we might interpret the gap between them and their parents and grandparents as positive evidence of that process. But the rising rate of youth suicide challenges that interpretation and, in any case, the fact that we are now being overtaken by the Information Revolution might have already distorted the process of adapting to the social consequences of the Industrial Revolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether or not you choose to adopt that particular account of Western society's psychological problems, it does seem likely that a satisfactory explanation of contemporary generation gaps will not be found in the conventional view of a simple journey through the life cycle, but in a much bigger picture of social and cultural change.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That probably is the most apt of the comments he has made in the chapter which is called, very aptly, `Insecurity makes humans of us all'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one were to look back at some of the works that perhaps predated the technological revolution or the information age, one would probably look at something like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Future Shock</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Third Wave</EMPHASIS>, both by Alvin Toffler, and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Powershift</EMPHASIS>, which was the third part of his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10867"> trilogy on social and technological change. One would see in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Future Shock</EMPHASIS> the prediction of this dislocation and alienation that is occurring in our community as a result of the enormous cultural, social and technological changes affecting all aspects of our lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, we are seeing the effect of so&hyphen;called future shock affecting the two generations on either side of the baby boomers probably the most seriously. In the case of what Hugh Mackay calls the `lucky generation'&mdash;the people born in the late 1920s and 1930s&mdash;and of the `options generation'&mdash;those born in the post baby boomers period&mdash;there appear to be very serious concerns or problems in the dislocative effect of the rapid changes in our community. I believe, as Hugh Mackay has pointed out&mdash;and, of course the committee has arrived at a similar conclusion&mdash;that that dislocation is one of the ingredients in the causes that have brought youth suicide to be such a serious problem in our community today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly enough, in the mid&hyphen;1960s Jacob Bronowski, author of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Ascent of Man</EMPHASIS>, wrote an essay entitled `Where do we go from here?', and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is evident that we are living in a cultural reformation&mdash;a harsh and perhaps disruptive movement in which we are all engaged. The fabric of western culture, its tangled skein of social habits, artefacts and values, is being pulled apart and made over&mdash;by us. We have set going the headlong changes in conduct and belief which now fill us with questions. Is there a single direction in these changes? Is there, in particular, an imaginative direction in the arts and sciences which points the way for a future culture? How shall we educate fresh generations, either to follow the changes or to lead them? What is the future of man? And is there any point in our wanting that future to conform to our own conception of man?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That leads me then to probably one of the most important aspects of Mackay's work, which in effect is a research project on the three generations and the interaction between them, and that is the fact that too often we tend to look at the other generations, particularly the ones that follow us, with the same sorts of attitudes that we have ourselves. We fail to understand the differences in cultural and social approaches in the generations that have come before us or are coming after us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, in the case of the options generation, the post baby boomers, there are some very fundamental and serious misconceptions about what it is that is either motivating them or troubling them&mdash;or, for that matter, about the sorts of things that they want to do with their lives and the sorts of things that they want to have or to get from the people in our generation. Most members of parliament would be of the baby boomers generation, with a few exceptions. I do not mean to insult the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent). I did not place him in the lucky generation: I think he looks much younger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, what this indicates is that there is a tendency for us to view societal problems, particularly in relation to the younger generation, from our own perspective. As a consequence, it is a perspective that is two&hyphen;dimensional and at times leads to mistaken conclusions about what ought to be done. One of the most important aspects of the committee's recommendations is the recommendation to ensure consistency in data collections at all levels of government. There is a dire need for us to much more thoroughly understand some of the social changes that are going on, not only in our generation but in the generation that is obviously suffering this very high youth suicide rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to commend Hugh Mackay on this work. I think it is probably one of the best pieces of contemporary social writing that I have seen for a long time. It certainly explores those differences and puts into context some of the problems that seem to us to be almost insoluble. And, of course, to some of those who are closer to the problem, it is insoluble; but, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10868"> in other cases, it is something that they live with from day to day. Hugh Mackay points out in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Generations</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allan Bloom, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Closing of the American Mind</EMPHASIS> , spoke for many older Australians as well when he exposed what he sees as the intellectual and moral confusions of our time. One of Bloom's central claims is that our contemporary passion for tolerance is a mere disguise for an unhealthy drift into relativism. He is particularly critical of the marriage of the drug culture with the contemporary music scene because he believes that it offers an ultimately unfulfilling short cut to the experience of ecstasy and gratification</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Hugh Mackay quotes Allan Bloom as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rock music provides premature ecstasy and, in this respect, is like the drugs with which it is allied. It artificially induces the exultation naturally attached to the completion of the greatest endeavours&mdash;victory in a just war, consummated love, artistic creation, religious devotion and discovery of truth. Without effort, without talent, without virtue, without exercise of the faculties, anyone and everyone is accorded the equal right to the enjoyment of their fruits.In my experience, students who have had a serious fling with drugs&mdash;and gotten over it&mdash;find it difficult to have enthusiasms or great expectations. It is as though the colour has been drained out of their lives, and they see everything in black and white. The pleasure they experienced in the beginning was so intense that they no longer look for it at the end, or as the end. They may function perfectly well, but dryly, routinely. Their energy has been sapped, and they do not expect their live's activity to produce anything but a living, whereas liberal education is supposed to encourage the belief that the good life is the pleasant life and that the best life is the most pleasant life.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And that would make sense to people in Peter Nugent's generation&mdash;the lucky generation; I have just redefined it. But it certainly is something that fits in with Hugh Mackay's other points about the options generation and their search for the sort of lifestyle options that they see readily available to, perhaps, the previous generation and that they need to try and indulge in as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And it is interesting that the drug culture is closely allied to the suicide culture. There is a very strong link between the two. It is interesting that when people talk about the sorts of character or other problems a person faces that leads them into drug taking, there are similar aspects to those and the sorts of things that lead young people to seek suicide as an answer to their problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important, when looking at the committee's recommendations, to understand this. We must ensure that we have consistent data collection in relation to these types of problems at all levels of government. I think that is critical because we desperately need to understand these problems and not look at them from a fundamentalist or, perhaps, a reactionary point of view that is tempting in some instances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We look at things such as the Internet and other aspects of our daily information lives and we say, `There is stuff on here that is dreadful. We ought to censor it.' But it is almost impossible to censor it. We need to look at it in the context of how that relates to the people who are likely to be its most ardent consumers and we need to understand in a more detailed way exactly what it is that is causing the sorts of dislocating problems that lead people to seek suicide as a way out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a problem of such magnitude that no&hyphen;one in our community could deny that substantial action is required as soon as possible, and that every delay contributes to further misery and suffering in families right across the nation. And some of the details highlighted by members speaking on this report are sobering, indeed. It is distressing that over the last 30 years the suicide rate for males has trebled and for females has doubled.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10869">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all agree that something must be done&mdash;it is the classical statement. The community says that something must be done and they expect us to do something about it, and we have the means to do it. Sometimes the actual practical application of policy is at odds with the general thrust and the good intentions of the members of the governments, or the authorities, who are trying to do something about the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I received a letter from a parent who is struggling with the fear that many in Australia face. He has a child who has become suicidal. I have got three children, one of whom is in his early teens, and it must be an absolutely devastating revelation. Each of us here should think about how we would cope, or what we would do if faced with a situation where a loved one becomes so depressed and distressed, or loses his or her sense of self&hyphen;worth to such an extent, as to want to end life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parent sought help. He has tried to obtain the best quality therapy to help his daughter regain the desire to live. He sought counselling and therapy through the public health system and found that there is a nine&hyphen;month waiting list. Nine months; that is extraordinary. He sought private psychiatric therapy and is faced with a six&hyphen;week wait. What goes through the mind of a parent every day and every night for six weeks, whenever that child is not directly supervised or protected or with them? Who knows?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of private therapy was quoted at $84.90 per hour. Medicare covers the first $110.11 and the rest is excess. It is not even covered by his health fund. I am not saying that people should not expect to pay for their health care at this time. What disturbs me though is that our society has developed a public health care system&mdash;and we are faced with these demands from the community and our own expectations of doing something&mdash;and here is a practical application of policy making it harder for a parent who loves his child to be able to do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am absolutely beside myself to think what on earth he must think when he is faced with this. What message does that give him? The message is quite clearly: the community thinks so little of the problem that it is prepared to make him wait nine months in the public health care system in order to get that sort of assistance for his child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my last few moments, I urge the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to make an urgent change to the situation so that parents like this particular correspondent are in a position to be able to get expert professional psychiatric help for their child when they are suicidal, depressed and despondent. These parents are in a position where help is desperately needed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS> , and I congratulate the committee on their work to date. The report is the result of a seminar conducted on 28 February 1997, which was addressed by four main speakers who have considerable experience in the field of health and community welfare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people are our future. They hold the key to the future of Australia and the world. Young people are generally very optimistic and vibrant. They eagerly plan for their futures and live life to its fullest. For some, however, the world seems to offer little hope or enjoyment. They feel trapped and not in control of their lives. They are looking for an escape and the only thing they can find is death. Such a tragedy of human life can hardly be endured. We feel for the young people who reach this level of hopelessness, and for their parents. As a parent of three young children, I know there could be nothing worse in life than to have a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10870"> child take his or her own life. Yet so many parents must suffer this tragedy and forever wonder whether they could have done anything to prevent it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aspects of youth suicide seminar was opened by our Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The Prime Minister emphasised the importance of the bipartisan approach to youth suicide prevention and I know members opposite share our concern for this issue. The government's commitment to youth suicide prevention is demonstrated by the initiation of the national youth suicide strategy, which I would like to outline for those present in this place. The national youth suicide strategy will provide funding of $19 million over three years in the fight to prevent youth suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recognising that rural and regional youth have a particularly high rate of suicide, the government will spend $6 million to provide them with counselling services and assistance. A further $6 million is being spent on Lifeline and a Kids Helpline telephone counselling service. Another $3 million will be spent on informing parents of the danger signs to watch for in their children and on how to cope with a child who may attempt to take his or her own life. A further $2 million will be spent on training for professionals working with children so that they are kept up to date with the latest information and methods of assistance. A further $1 million will be spent on childhood mental health. This is in addition to funding under the `Here for Life' program introduced by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When addressing the problem of youth suicide, it is important to identify those young people most at risk. This was the clear message that came out of the seminar. Statistics are not always totally accurate when endeavouring to ascertain the level of the problem in our community. Some suicides are not recorded as such because it may not have been considered as suicide at the time of death or to protect the family from further trauma. Furthermore, young people can often indulge in highly dangerous activities that lead to death. Activities such as glue sniffing and train surfing, whilst not necessarily being intentionally suicidal, show a complete lack of concern for their own safety. For these reasons, the statistics for youth suicide could be considerably understated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seminar was presented with the official statistics which showed that, in 1995, there were 350 young male suicides and 84 young female suicides. When we talk of youth suicide, we are referring to people as young as 12 who take their own lives. How 12&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds could possibly have reached the depths of despair that would lead them to kill themselves is beyond most of us. We can only read of such occurrences with complete shock and sadness. The official statistics show that, since the 1960s, the rate of young male suicide has almost trebled and, for young females, it has doubled. But what are the reasons? Why are many young people so willing to end their lives?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world has never been safer or the future brighter for most people living in Western nations. Today, the majority of us are living longer and healthier lives. The opportunities available to young people through education and careers are many and varied. Discrimination based on race, sex or creed is on a steep decline and we now live in a fairer and more tolerant society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why do many of our young people feel that life, for them, is not worth living? It has taken quite a long time for us to realise the importance of this issue and, until recently, little research had been done on youth suicide. This research has shown that the causes of youth suicide are very complex and are influenced by many factors. Building a prevention strategy is thus made more difficult because of the complex nature of the causes. Only persons who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10871"> take their own lives will ever really know what made them do it; even then, it is likely to have been a combination of a number of factors which lead to their decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The classic symptoms of a person who may be contemplating suicide include sadness, tearfulness, irritability, poor sleep patterns, loss of interest in things in which they were previously interested, apathy, loss of appetite, and sleeping in. Depression can descend upon a person for many reasons, not least of which is when they suffer a loss of some kind. This can be in the form of the loss of a close family member or friend, or the loss of a job or career. Public humiliation and shame can also lead to depression and a sense of loss. When a number of these factors coincide, the person is very susceptible to suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another factor to be considered is the breakdown of the more traditional value system that existed in the recent past. I said earlier that there have been great advances in living standards and conditions in the world. There have also been massive changes which have led to social dislocation. Such changes have seen the divorce rate increase, the increased participation of women in the work force and the subsequent increase in youth unemployment, and a large number of unwanted pregnancies. Excessive use of alcohol and other drugs, confusion about sexuality and rejection because of sexuality, and the rise of the copycat syndrome are also factors which may contribute to suicidal tendencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst these social changes would not by themselves necessarily lead a young person to commit suicide, they do add to the sense of hopelessness, isolation and despair which some of them feel. Perhaps what we have to consider in today's society is that it appears that there is no longer any room for a child to discover his or her individuality. The community tends to want to construct childhood within a carefully sequential set of life experiences as a socially constructed norm. There are no allowances made for a child to make mistakes and experience disappointment, and to learn to deal with those disappointments in a positive way, when everything is geared for constructed success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our children are often on a merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round of expectations of our community to succeed in their music lessons, to succeed in their sporting endeavours and to succeed academically. The pressure of conforming to societal expectations and mores, as well as pressure from their peers, can lead to an overwhelming anxious and depressive state, especially when they perceive themselves to have failed. Add to this the growing prevalence of violence in the media and on film, which suggests that violence is the solution to all problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, my 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old son asked me whether you could die if you had Coke poured into your ears. When I asked why he would want to know whether that was a way to die, his answer was that he had been listening to some music on the radio and they were listing lots of different ways to commit suicide. Of concern to me is that not only do we have a diet of enforced violence portrayed constantly on our televisions and video games, for even very young children and through to adolescents, but our adolescents are constantly bombarded with violent and sadistic role models within the music industry. Thus, even though our society has progressed, there are some who have not been able to take advantage of the many benefits that have come from this progress. These people may feel left out and forgotten and feel drawn towards negative role models.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They feel that they have no control over their own destiny and that by taking their lives they are taking back that control. It is difficult to accurately measure the number of suicides which occur. It is even more difficult to come up with an accurate number of attempted suicides. Suicide is still a no&hyphen;go zone for many people. It is something that is not to be discussed in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10872"> public, or, if it is, discussed in whispers only. This only adds to the sense of being an outcast which many who have attempted suicide must feel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seminar was informed of hospital statistics which indicated that for every suicide there are 10 admissions to hospital for attempted suicide. Of those who attempt suicide and fail, it is estimated that 60 per cent of completed suicide cases had previously attempted suicide. This certainly sends a strong message for the need for more to be done in counselling and support services for those who have reached the depths of despair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the recommendations contained in this report is for the standardisation of procedures for hospitals to adopt when treating a young person who has attempted suicide. I would certainly support this recommendation as a means of reducing the number of completed suicides. To attempt to take one's own life is a clear indication of the need for help. To have so many people who have already made the attempt later completing their suicide is a strong indication that more needs to be done after the initial attempt to help these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has made a number of other recommendations and I will now focus my comments on these. Firstly, it is recommended that a national advisory council on youth suicide prevention be established. The role of the council would be to provide advice to the minister and the government on youth suicide prevention. It has been further recommended that within six months of the establishment of the council, a three-year working plan should have been produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very great need for a further focus of our attention on this problem and I would certainly endorse any program that would be able to successfully devise a plan to reduce the incidence of youth suicide. I hope that should such a council be established it would work closely and cooperatively with the appropriate state government departments and non&hyphen;government agencies to ensure that a fully coordinated approach is taken in addressing this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second recommendation is for the establishment of a research advisory committee. Its role would be to advise the National Health and Medical Research Council on research into youth suicide. As previously mentioned, one of the biggest problems we have is that until recently very little detailed research was conducted into this issue. The need for continuing research into the problem of youth suicide is evident and I endorse this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third recommendation contains several specific areas in which more is to be done to bring about a decline in youth suicide. The committee has called for the establishment of a depression awareness campaign to educate young people on how to recognise depression and how to get help. It recommends the use of the Internet to convey the message. The Internet is being used for so many things these days and I would certainly endorse its use for something as worthwhile as this. Again, I hope that this campaign would work with any localised programs around Australia so that the end result will be as successful as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not want any unnecessary duplication that could cloud the issue and dilute the message. I believe that the committee understands this point because it is also recommended that there will be a review of current funding and redirection of some funds to more appropriate and better targeted programs. It is also recommended that there be consistency in data collection at all levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the people in my electorate of Makin I would like to thank the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, and in particular the chairman, the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), for conducting the seminar and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10873"> preparing the report of aspects of youth suicide. It has further focused our attention on this serious problem and has caused us to revise some of the previous assumptions we may have held concerning the nature of this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When hurt or frightened, very young children will shout, scream and cry. As they grow older they collect the various inhibitions and prejudices which seem to come with the approach of adulthood. When a youth is hurt, isolated, and in despair, he or she does not cry out for help in the same way as a child. Very often they keep it inside themselves and let the pressure build until, finally, they can take no more. It breaks my heart to think of any young person taking his or her own life. If the recommendations contained in this report help to reduce the number of youths committing suicide, then the report has my wholehearted support and that of all Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As with all the previous speakers, it gives me no pleasure at all to rise on such a sombre subject but I must acknowledge the chairman, the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper); the deputy chairman, the member for Franklin (Mr Quick); and the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. In my short contribution today of a few minutes, I would like to quote from the Prime Minister's speech when he opened the youth suicide seminar in February 1997. John Howard said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And I am sure that the committee in its treatment of it will understand that everybody, government and opposition members alike, approach this with a positive sense, and a sense of commitment and goodwill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that that is how the committee has approached its task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess we all hope that the recommendations of the committee will assist in managing this blight on our society. The main recommendations of the committee include the need for the establishment of a national advisory council, the establishment of a research advisory committee, a depression awareness program, standard hospital procedures for attempted suicide and self&hyphen;harm, and an immediate review of current funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a regional Australian, this issue is all too close to my mind and to my heart. Only in very recent weeks someone very close to me had to endure, and God knows how, the situation of losing a young person by suicide. The previous speaker, the member for Makin (Mrs Draper), commented on the number of people suiciding. It is interesting to note that those most at risk&mdash;this is from figures in 1995, the latest figures available&mdash;are young males. They are four times more likely to successfully achieve suicide. It is one of the great ironies, I guess, and we would all agree on this, that in this land of plenty, for most of us, we have this increasing social disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we could all identify with some of the sociological factors that are mentioned in the report: the divorce rates, the employment issues of one or other of the parents or both parents&mdash;that no doubt implicates the amount of time and commitment that have been given to children, from birth through to adolescence and early adulthood&mdash;the youth unemployment issue, alcohol consumption, the issue of unwanted pregnancies, and personal factors of loss, divorce, isolation, sexuality and copycat behaviour. I am not sure that any of those really explain what is occurring. They are, to me, passing reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect there is a much deeper malaise in our society that is to do with how we view family, how we view friends, how we view neighbours and how we view community, and it is to do with our personal beliefs, our culture and, for many of us, our spiritual beliefs. Having personally experienced, in a more moderate sense, the pain of almost losing two of my children 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10874"> in a road accident is enough to remind me of the immense pain that parents, family and friends endure in the event of a young person taking his or her own life. I suspect the answer lies in the way society has developed over the last 10 or 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly we can come to the key issues of how we might do it and how we might get the expert opinion which is all important, but I suspect there are simpler, more personal and basic issues here which we need to understand and respect more than we have in the last decade or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the committee. I am sure this is a positive start to trying to understand youth suicide and to seeing what we can do as a parliament, in cooperation with our state colleagues and all the agencies, to seek some improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I suppose the most memorable contribution to the seminar in February was from a father who lost his daughter by suicide. He described the years and years of the many attempts and how the family attempted to cope. For those people, let us hope that in this place&mdash;with whatever limited power we have&mdash;we will be able to make some progress on this shocking issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue in this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS> , from the seminar convened earlier this year, is really what life is all about and it is really what political debate should be all about. One of the great dangers for governments of all political persuasions is that we run the risk of becoming obsessed with economic indices, as important as they are, and fail to appreciate that in the end all of the important questions of life, of which this is one, remain to be answered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Teenage is suicide, isn't it?' That was the response given by one teenaged young woman to the Keys Young report which was commissioned by the federal government as a survey of 2,400 young people between the ages of 14 and 24, to find out what their attitudes were to mental illness, ill health and despair, of which suicide is the ultimate manifestation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, it gets worse. Many young people see stress, anxiety and depression as a normal part of adolescence. Seven per cent of young people between the ages of 14 to 24 who were surveyed had attempted suicide; at any one time in Australia, three per cent of young people up to the age of 18 will suffer from a serious depressive illness; and, by the time they are aged 18, 23 per cent will have suffered from depression of a serious nature at some time in their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The critical question is why. In the space of two generations, we have seen a 300 per cent increase in suicide rates for young Australian men. On average we have one young person taking his or her own life each day, and another 50 who try. It is a sad indictment of society that, whilst over the last 10 years we have been able to reduce the toll that is taken by disease and accident, we have had absolutely no impact on that exacted by despair. In fact, as many young people will die from suicide this year as from car accidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opinions as to the causes are rather diverse. There are those who see it as a medical problem&mdash;that this is depression of a clinical nature which has not been identified and treated&mdash;and certainly there is truth in that. There is very good evidence to suggest that about 90 per cent of young people who commit suicide had a depressive illness at the time which was not identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also another view, that what we are seeing is the evidence of a failure of society. I must say that I am attracted to both views, but perhaps more so to the latter. If you look 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10875"> throughout modern society at the moment you will see evidence of a society that is failing. We have a suicide rate of young people that is amongst the highest in the industrialised world, 16.4 per 100,000 for 16&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are a nation that has been engaged in a debate about everyone's attitude to euthanasia. We are a country that has elevated gambling to the status of a religion in some parts of the country. We are also a nation engaged in what has been described as a race debate. On any day of the week you can open a newspaper, turn on a television or listen to a radio station and hear some person describe another as being a racist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have a level of drug use, both illegal and legal, which has reached unprecedented levels. We are a country that has a rapidly disappearing middle class and a growing divide between those who have extreme wealth and those who live in extreme poverty. We are also a nation which would appear at least to have some degree of institutionalised pederast behaviour. All of these things historically are evidence and characteristics of a society that is failing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The health and wellbeing of young people, and the extent to which we nurture their idealism and protect their vulnerable transition into adult life, are critical measures of any society. Idealism is something which some people in public life abandon and, in doing so, court irrelevancy; and individuals and governments from time to time are both guilty of just that. But idealism is something for which young people will sign on, as well as their altruism and their sense of wanting to build a better future both for themselves and indeed for others. But you have to feel that your ideals are rooted in something that is achievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he was President of the United States of America, John F. Kennedy identified the real struggles for his generation as being against poverty, tyranny, disease and war. If those of you who spend time with young people ask them what it is that we as Australians believe in and what our values and beliefs are, they struggle to tell you. Thirty years ago, they would have had very little trouble with that question. It was a nation where we had a set of values that held us together: God, Queen and Country. Inevitably, some of these things change. But the worst thing that we have done over the past 20 years is create a culture in which young people feel that they have nothing greater than themselves in which to believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hugh Mackay, in one of his columns in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper in February this year, invited his readers to consider the question of who, in the 1990s, our heroes are. It is often the kind of heroes we have that is the measure both of our dreams and indeed of what we have achieved. Most young people today have great difficulty answering that question. The romance of struggle that rallied earlier generations is now all but dead for the next generation of young people; and, for many, life is simply a grim determination to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thematic currency for youth suicide is, in my opinion, that we have failed to transmit a sense of belonging and a sense of meaningful purpose to young Australians. Many of them feel that they live within a system, simply awaiting the outcome of events rather than anticipating any meaningful role in them. When you feel that you have no ability to control what is happening in your life, it is then that you feel a sense of hopelessness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my opinion, what Australia needs, and needs urgently, is a sense of strategic vision. We need a sense of who we are, how we relate to one another and what is important to us; but we also need a sense of where we are going. Young people in particular need to feel that their future is something more than the subject of political and financial exploitation. The challenge for governments, and indeed for our own government, is to develop a process wherein young 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10876"> Australians feel that they are able to have meaningful input into the political process, into the decisions that are being made about their lives and the kind of future that perhaps lies ahead of them. It would play a catalytic role, in my view, in developing a greater sense of optimism and purpose for the next generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also lived through a period in the past 15 or 20 years where we have seen attacks on institutions. We have seen the marginalisation of churches in the development of public policy. I must say I quite disagree with those who say that churches should not be involved in public debate. One of the prices for our shallowness which is now being paid by our children is that we have marginalised ethical, thoughtful or philosophical contribution to public debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also demeaned the importance of parenting as a full&hyphen;time occupation. We have denigrated at times those who have participated in voluntary work and described them as do&hyphen;gooders. We have also pushed young people to the zenith of educational achievement and we have placed far more importance on the utilitarian value of education than on its importance for personal development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often not what people say when they answer polls that we should listen to, but what they feel, what is deep in the national psyche. Anyone with any shred of perception that spends some time with young people will tell you that many of them feel that they are studying beyond their natural abilities in courses that in their hearts they do not really want to be doing, for jobs they doubt are really likely to exist. We have a whole section of young people in society who feel that there is no place for them, that they are cut off from the economic and cultural mainstream. And the most important challenge we have ahead of us is re&hyphen;engaging them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time in many generations we have a group of young people now who, unlike us, face a future that does not automatically guarantee them a higher standard of living than that enjoyed by their parents. Most kids today know that they will struggle to achieve the standard of living that their parents have had, let alone exceed it. And yet a belief in progress and in improvement is central to our culture. It is a dominant feature of political debate. Every day here we are talking about growth&mdash;trying to get growth up, trying to make progress&mdash;but that is inconsistent with the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day experiences and expectations of many young Australians. And when the ideal that we, as leaders in the community, set for young people is quite different from the reality that life cruelly delivers to them, is it any wonder that they pay the ultimate price for our shallowness. We remain tethered to a value system that still equates success with a BMW, a mobile phone, fashionable clothing, and a very high TER or VCE. And for a significant and growing minority of young people, those goals are simply unachievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know this sounds like heresy, but I really feel that some time over the next decade&mdash;and probably sooner&mdash;our country will need to re&hyphen;examine its values and expectations. There is a price to be paid for our clinging to a facade that we will achieve two or three per cent unemployment in the foreseeable future, that every person will have a job, and that every person can expect to buy and own a house and a nice car. In clinging to that facade and promoting that as the ultimate measure of progress, we are basically telling a lot of young people that there is no place for them and that there is no hope. And of all the emotions that are powerful in overcoming adversity and effecting change, it is hope more than anything else that achieves it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10877">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think that we are a society, as I say, that is failing in many ways. Of the many things that have happened one of them is that we have in Australia a moral crisis, and it is deeply rooted in the higher priority people place on their rights rather than their responsibilities. The here and now is considered more important than respect for the past, or any kind of meaningful planning for the future, and we are preoccupied with the value of things, rather than values. That is one of the reasons I would actually encourage churches and organisations like that to be participants in public policy debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A society that defines freedom in terms of rights and not responsibilities, that encourages moral licence but discourages political engagement, diminishes and demeans individuals. Australia has much less to anchor it today than it had 30 years ago and if you want to look at young people's feelings, you have only to look at the Coca&hyphen;Cola ads which have always been on the cutting edge of the way young people are thinking&mdash;and exploiting them in doing it, I might add. The latest one says, `You can do whatever you want. It's your life and you can do it now.' That is a value that is permeating the entire culture and if we do not address it quickly, we will fail. As important as it is, connecting young people to the Internet and realising that our economic future lies in knowledge based industries and not steel, manufacturing and coal exports, as it did in the past, is not the most important task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important task that we have ahead of us is to set realistic goals, values and expectations for the next generation. Not only do we have to connect them to the Internet but also we have to connect them to one another. We have to rediscover in Australia a sense of community, a sense in which each person feels that they have a place in the society, that they will be cared for irrespective of their background, but in return they have an obligation to show concern and to commit themselves to a ethic of service to other people. What we need most is, as Hugh Mackay, I think, has said, the resource of our personal relationships. What we need most in a world of technological change, of enormous economic uncertainty and of fundamentalist intolerance is one another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend this report and its recommendations to the House and to the parliament&mdash;and, in particular, to the government. In relation to youth suicide, we are now where we were with road trauma in the early 1970s. We are funding some very good programs, but the lack of coordination is something that disturbs me. It was not until we realised that dealing with road trauma was more than just speed limits&mdash;that it was seat belts, driver education, drink driving, car design, road design and a whole range of multifaceted initiatives&mdash;that we make real progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recognising and treating despair and oppressive illness in young people is important. Bringing adults up to speed, including doctors, in terms of recognising despair in young people is important. But if we ignore the changes that are occurring to our culture, if we do not give ourselves a sense of purpose and belonging and a sense of future, then we will fail. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

These days, the influence of the media, the contents of film and music, are often seen to glorify suicide. Self&hyphen;induced deaths of teen idols may be seen by some of our young people as a glamorous and romantic solution to end life's troubles. On top of that, the rapid pace of technology has brought us closer to global influences. International cults and fanatics, that can prey on the insecure and depressed in our society for the sake of some self&hyphen;sacrificial higher calling, can often have an instant impact on those who seek an easy way out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The taking of one's life is, of course, no new occurrence. But the ever increasing rate of incidents is especially topical in recent years, and of major concern. Many schools, community groups, churches, parents and professionals are trying desperately to find ways to cope with this trend, to alert people to look for and, indeed, to recognise signs and changes in behavioural patterns that may indicate a person's contemplation to commit suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, an opportunity to address a number of functions and school community groups on this important social issue has been welcomed by me. Only last August, I was speaking at several suicide prevention seminars organised by local churches in my electorate of Canning. The involvement by many mums and dads&mdash;and, of course, other people&mdash;in these seminars is, I believe, a good indication of the community's commitment to finding practical ways to beat this dilemma, and I commend them most highly for their efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian </EMPHASIS>newspaper on 13 November reported that more than one in 20 young Australians had attempted suicide. The state coroner, Mr A. Hope, said in his annual report that suicide was the most common cause of non&hyphen;natural deaths in Western Australia. And, in an earlier contribution, my colleague the member for Forde (Mrs Elson) talked about the national figures on youth suicide indicating that a quarter of all young male deaths and 70 per cent of all young female deaths in 1995 were attributed to suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it therefore surprising that we are all asking, `What can be done?' Or more importantly, should we ask, `What must be done?' The Howard government is one which recognises that policy development in suicide  prevention is a difficult task. Indeed, there is no miracle cure. It is difficult because many of the traditional support institutions, such as family and church, are no longer being turned to by some youths when they need hope, guidance, love and security. Such vacuums can lead to a loss of belief in one's self. They can result in enormous apathy and indifference which can overtake lives. They can cause depression from which one may never recover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Knowing how to provide practical advice for someone who may need to counsel a person who is suicidal requires certain skills. Recognition must be acknowledged of the symptoms, and a focus is needed on depression awareness and problem solving skills. The treatment of depression in itself as a socially acceptable illness will go a long way to helping those susceptible to wanting to take such a drastic final action as killing themselves. Above all, educating the community about what has, for far too long, been a taboo subject is a great step forward in developing strategies towards the prevention of suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An often overlooked area in this tragic issue is the necessary support and information available to parents who want to help their children. Statistics have shown that where parental 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10879"> understanding is available, suicide attempts can be reduced. The major influence on young people comes from family life. That is why we cannot underestimate the importance of family relationships in setting examples of how to communicate and to recognise depression. Knowing precisely where family members can turn to for such help and support is imperative. Any activities undertaken to reduce the rate of youth suicides require the cooperation of federal, state and territory governments and all sectors of the community to work together for the common good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations brought down by the committee deserve commendation. That priority was given to the establishment of a national advisory council on youth suicide prevention indeed indicates the extent to which this strategy is being recognised. The council's aim is to provide strategic advice and have direct input into policy making through the Department of Health and Family Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second priority was for the formation of a research advisory committee to assist in the development and management of essential research projects. Thirdly, priority was given to the more immediate task of developing strategies that focus on increasing public awareness of the symptoms, identifying people at risk of suicide, and educating young people on how to get help. In the l996&hyphen;97 budget the Howard government provided $19 million over three years for research and activities that will provide support and understanding of these very important issues. Raising awareness of the issues and coming up with practical solutions will, of course, also be very beneficial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all have an obligation to do what we can to see that this community tragedy is halted. This government is certainly committed to playing an instrumental and vital part in achieving that goal. We have an obligation to give our youth a vision and a purpose to live for and, most importantly, to recognise that there is lots of good in them. Today, all we see, as I said earlier in this debate, is the negative aspect portrayed on television and throughout our media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of our youth are good kids. They have a great thing going for them. But we need to recognise, understand and acknowledge that for them. We need to influence them to go to even further heights. It is only by praising them for what they are doing that we can perhaps achieve what we are all desperately trying to do&mdash;that is, to talk them out of the silly nonsense of wanting to take their own lives simply because it is too difficult to live for today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me close by saying that together, as a community that acknowledges values, beliefs and morals as a cornerstone of our family life and society, we can all reduce the scourge of youth suicide.</PARA>
