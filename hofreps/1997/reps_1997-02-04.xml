<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on 31 January 1997, of Senator John Horace Panizza, a Senator for the state of Western Australia since 1987, Opposition Whip in the Senate from 1995 to 1996; and Government Whip in the Senate since 1996, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is, I suppose, a special poignancy when one of our serving colleagues dies and when he goes from our midst on public service, as was the case with John Panizza, who died whilst participating at a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges in Cairns on 31 January.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Panizza was born on 24 March 1931 at Southern Cross in Western Australia. He was a farmer and property developer in Western Australia before entering federal politics. He came to the Senate with a very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> solid background in local government. He had been a councillor of the Yilgarn Shire Council from 1975 to 1987, during which he was Shire President for five years from 1982 to 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a very successful wheat grower. It was often the object of very friendly remark by many colleagues who regularly travelled the distance to Western Australia that, if you fell asleep at the beginning of John's property, you could still have a decent respite, wake up and still be travelling across it. He was very much a man of the soil. He was a person who fought tenaciously for the interests of his state and for the interests of the wheat growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was of very direct and blunt manner. His interventions in the party room were always to the point. They were always prefaced by his saying, `Prime Minister, you ought to understand that they are saying this.' And you were left in no doubt about what they were saying. He always managed to cut through in his contributions in the party room and to push aside a lot of the humbug.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his maiden speech to the Senate, he referred to his election as a realisation of an ambition that he had had since he was 20 years old. He spoke on the many issues primary industries faced in Western Australia, and he displayed a wide knowledge of these industries, ranging from wheat growing and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2"> meat production to mining, including the gold and diamond industries, to fishing. Above all, he declared his commitment to the needs and concerns of rural Western Australia, to its people and to its industries. He touched on important rural issues such as access to all levels of education by country children and adequate water supply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Significantly, John concluded his maiden speech by referring to his Italian parentage and paid special tribute to the hardships, the achievements and the contributions that migrants have made to the building of modern Australia. He was, as I understand, the first person of Italian parentage to be elected to the Australian Senate. His vision of a tolerant united Australian community was not tied up with the obsessions of professional lobbies but, rather, with the down-to&hyphen;earth determination to ensure that all Australians, irrespective of their background, were treated equally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout his parliamentary career, he never ceased to champion the interests that he entered the Senate to represent. He was a staunch member and active participant in the affairs of the Liberal Party over a long period of time. Along with all the other members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, he played a major role in the resurgence of the Western Australian division at the time of the state election before last and played a major role in the success of the division in the last federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He served as Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate in 1993, and when the coalition assumed government in March of last year he was elected to the position of Government Whip in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His efforts on Senate committees were acknowledged on all sides of politics. In his 9&half; years in the Senate he served on numerous committees. At the time of his death, he was a serving member of the Senate Economics References Committee, the House Committee, the Privileges Committee and the Standing Committee for the Selection of Bills as well as the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. As I mentioned at the commencement of my remarks, he was in Cairns working on the Privileges Committee at the time of his death.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his passing, Western Australia, the parliament and my party&mdash;the Liberal Party&mdash;have lost a strong, down&hyphen;to&hyphen;earth voice. We miss him greatly. I spoke to his wife, Coral, a few hours after his death. He died in his sleep with his wife beside him. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Coral, to his mother, Mrs Caterina Panizza, to his children, Frank, Janine, Stephen and Linda and to their families our very sincere sympathy in their sudden bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His funeral will take place in St Mary's Catholic Cathedral in Perth on Friday morning. I and many other members of the government will attend the funeral to pay our respects to a well&hyphen;loved and a very well&hyphen;respected colleague.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take this opportunity to record my personal gratitude to a number of my colleagues&mdash;Senator Helen Coonan, Senator Chris Ellison, Senator Bill O'Chee and others&mdash;who were with John and Coral Panizza in Cairns when John died suddenly. My colleagues rendered immediate compassion, sympathy and support to Coral quite naturally and as a spontaneous expression of their concern for the bereavement suffered by the wife of a colleague.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will miss John. He was a cheerful, lovable bloke who epitomised the down&hyphen;to&hyphen;earth qualities of the Australian bush. He brought a lot to parliament. He threw his heart into what he did in his life. He was a devoted family man. He was a devoted farmer. He was a devoted servant of the Liberal Party. He was proud of his Italian heritage, but he was a 100 per cent lover of the Australian nation, which he served so very well.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on this very sad occasion. I guess most members of this House, particularly Western Australians, can scarcely believe that this has happened, because Senator Panizza, if you knew the man, seemed so indestructible. He seemed so much part of the soil which he tilled; he was as solid and as timeless as the Australian earth itself. That he should die in office is an occasion of very great sadness for us all and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3"> not an outcome that any of us would have expected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has outlined Senator Panizza's meritorious service in the Senate and elsewhere and I will not go over the ground that the Prime Minister covered canvassing those, except to say this: it is attested on our side of the House that Senator Panizza's decency, generosity, truthfulness, honesty and plain dealing is the experience of all of us in relation to him. His departure is mourned I suspect almost as much on our side of the House as it is on the other side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was an effective senator representing the interests of many Western Australians. He was an authentic Australian success story of the postwar era. If you look at his background and the sorts of things he did, you begin to understand that there was one unfortunate feature of his life: because he had to struggle so hard, because he had to do so much, he probably arrived at each stage of his public service a little later than would otherwise have been the case; hence we find him in office, at the age of 65, having had a fairly short period of service in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He preceded that with a most extraordinary record of establishing himself in an area of Western Australia which is not easy to establish yourself in. Life out there is always a struggle. The rewards are great if you get it right, but it is always a struggle. He had interests that were broad, not just in the agricultural sector. He developed empathy with his area in the mining industry as well. So his success in business and in farming life was matched by his contribution to public life&mdash;long service in local government and then service in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have lost a very good colleague. Western Australia has lost a very good senator. We have lost from this parliament a person with an unusual record: the first in the Senate of Italian descent. We provided the first member of the House of Representatives born in Italy&mdash;Con Sciacca. I know they had some interesting chats together as the years proceeded. But that was a major achievement on Senator Panizza's part&mdash;to win preselec 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion and come into this place with the background that he had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The WA Liberal Party has lost an effective campaigner and member, but above all his wife, Coral, and their four children have lost a beloved husband and father. I will not, unfortunately, be able to attend his funeral, but I will make sure that I am appropriately represented, and I apologise to his family in advance at the same time as I extend the opposition's deepest sympathy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a great shock to learn at Broken Hill last Friday of the passing of John Panizza and I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in expressing my sadness and sympathy to members of the Panizza family. John, it has been said, was a staunch advocate of things Western Australian, things relating to the primary industries of Western Australia and indeed of Australia and matters relating to rural and regional Australia. He was arguably the largest single wheat producer ever to sit in the federal parliament and he took not just an interest in that industry but also an interest in a wide range of primary industries in a dedicated and determined way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister has mentioned, John Panizza, before entering the Senate, gave great service to the local government area around Southern Cross, from which he came, serving as shire president and performing a range of other community activities. His contributions in the Senate were consistent since he entered that place in 1987. He always put forward a very strongly held view and put effort into his comments whether it was in the Senate, in committee meetings or in the joint party room of the Liberal and National parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say to the House that I think Western Australian members of this parliament&mdash;be they members of the House of Representatives or be they members of the Senate&mdash;carry a particular burden created by the time zone difference and the extra hours spent on aircraft as they travel to and from Canberra and many other places. For instance, Senator Panizza was in Far North Queensland 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4"> with the Privileges Committee when the tragic event occurred. It is a burden; it is one which must tell on their health by degrees. John Panizza always gave the manifestation of being a particularly tough, determined operator, yet the burden caught up with him. I am very conscious of that extra burden carried by Western Australian members of this parliament and I really do express my sympathy and that of my wife, Judy, to the Panizza family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make one other point. John Panizza's maiden speech highlighted the fact that he travelled enormous distance in the contest of the Western Australian Senate elections both in 1985, the time he lost by 115 votes, and in 1987. It does take a particular determination to bounce back from a lost campaign in which you just miss out, yet he did that and went forward to take up a seat in the Senate as the son of Italian parents, creating yet another first. In his maiden speech, which the Prime Minister briefly referred to, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time when the term `multiculturalism' has been misconstrued&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">remember that this was back in 1987&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">through prejudice and mistrust, each Australian, including political parties, must dedicate themselves to overcome those elements of ignorance and prejudice in our society which are counterproductive to Australia being a successful nation, a cohesive nation, a democratic nation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I say amen to that. I am very glad that, in addition to a cathedral service being held in Perth on Friday morning, arrangements are in hand to have on Tuesday morning of next week a mass in his honour at the cathedral in Manuka.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Paterson, former Federal President of the National Party&mdash;he has stepped down from that position&mdash;and the Western Australian Nationals have conveyed to me their desire to be associated with this condolence motion. They obviously had many more direct dealings with him over the years. I have the happy duty of passing that on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Panizza family can be rightly proud of the contribution John Panizza made to the state of Western Australia and, through his service in the Senate, to the nation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on 17 January 1997, of the Honourable Charles Robert (Bert) Kelly CMG, a Member of this House for the Division of Wakefield from 1958 to 1977, Deputy Government Whip from 1964 to 1967, Minister for Works from 1967 to 1968, and Minister for the Navy from 1968 to 1969, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bert Kelly, as he was affectionately known by his colleagues and many others, was born on 22 June 1912 at Riverton in South Australia. He was a farmer in South Australia before entering federal politics. He was a member of the South Australian Soil Conservation Committee from 1940 to 1958 and also served on the South Australian Advisory Board of Agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1951 Bert was awarded a Nuffield Fellowship to study farming in Britain. This was the first time farming fellowships had been awarded in Australia. Although his interest in primary production and in related issues such as soil conservation was to remain with him throughout his subsequent parliamentary career, his overwhelming concern and the single issue which he championed fearlessly and tirelessly in his political life was tariff reduction and free trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in the news release that I issued marking his death, no person in the postwar parliamentary period or earlier than that period championed the cause of lower tariffs and free trade ahead of Bert Kelly. Whatever people's views may have been of Bert Kelly's views, he was, in a parliamentary sense, the trailblazer of lower tariffs. The significant thing about Bert Kelly's contribution was that, at the time he began to argue the cause of lower tariffs, it was not a particularly popular line to be taken. The conventional wisdom all round, indeed substantially on both sides of politics, was that it was a good idea to protect Australian industry from outside competition and that, if that imposed some burden on the export industries of Australia, then you compensated for that burden by some direct subsidies to those export industries. Bert 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5"> Kelly's father had been a member of the tariff board, and Bert himself, from his early days in parliament, began to champion the cause of lower tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I always found Bert Kelly's speeches entertaining. They were always full of humour. He developed to the full that great Australian art&mdash;and it is an art when it is developed effectively to the full&mdash;of self-deprecation. He could argue a case with winning humour. His speeches, I found in my experience after I entered parliament, always attracted a good attendance, particularly from government and some of the then opposition backbenchers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert was one of the serving members of parliament who made me, as a member of the contingent of parliamentarians who came in in 1974, particularly welcome. I can remember spending many happy times with Bert and one of his South Australian colleagues Jim Forbes in the bar of Old Parliament House in the months that immediately followed my election. One of the other people who was always there listening to Bert's speeches&mdash;and I noticed a bit of rapport developing between him and Bert Kelly&mdash;was the then only recently elected member for Moore, John Hyde, who had entered parliament in the same year I had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert was a trailblazer. He wrote a very lively column under the title `Modest Member'. A society was formed in his honour: the Society of Modest Members. Therefore, he did make quite a contribution towards the development of the line of argument that is variously paraded under the description of economic rationalism, dry economics, free trade or whatever description you want to give it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not an occasion for trying to demonstrate who is right or who is wrong but rather an occasion to honour the fact that ahead of others Bert was prepared to courageously put points of view that a lot of people much senior to him in the government of which he was a backbench member and briefly a frontbench member would have heavily deprecated. I do not know that he would have got much encouragement but he probably would have got a great deal of deprecation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from the then Labor Party opposition, who was as heavily, if not more heavily, into the causes against which he so passionately argued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert Kelly was a very earthy man in the best sense of that word. He was awake to anybody who was a humbug. He had a tremendous sense of humour. He concealed from most the deep hurt and disappointments that he felt in relation to his ministerial career. What was remarkable about Bert Kelly, in my experience of members of parliament, was that he spent only a very brief period on the front bench and most of his time on the back bench over quite a long period from 1958 until 1977, when, as a result of a redistribution, he was knocked out of the ring in a preselection contest, if my memory serves me correctly by his fellow South Australian Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles. These things sometimes happen in the best of managed circles. They had a bit of a clash and Bert came out second best. I think he had been spending more time arguing the causes in which he believed than attending to his branches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Be that as it may, he continued to argue the cause. He continued to gather followers and devotees. There were many of my friends and acquaintances in the parliamentary Liberal Party in the 1980s who regarded Bert Kelly as some kind of antipodean Adam Smith when it came to the causes that they believed in and the causes that they were arguing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was one of those people who had a capacity to be remembered for the ideas that he championed rather than the particular policies that he implemented. He played a role in not only shifting thinking inside the Liberal Party, which he certainly did&mdash;and any member of the Liberal Party who pretends that Bert Kelly did not make a contribution to shifting the thinking inside the party on issues relating to industry protection and to more deregulation and freeing of the economy do not understand the history of debates inside our party&mdash;but also in arguing for deregulation and those other policies in the Australian press.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say, on behalf of the parliamentary Liberal Party, that, in expressing our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6"> sorrow at his death, we acknowledge that he lived to a good age, into his middle 80s. He had a long and very happy personal life and a very good life. His departure from federal politics in 1977 was marked by many tributes, perhaps best summed up by a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bert Kelly is almost a legend. He is one of those rare politicians who actually manages to see the importance of consistent long-term policies over immediate party advantage.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That may be collectively a little wounding to many, but it is a fair comment about the causes that Bert Kelly argued for. I certainly found him intellectually consistent. I found him good humoured. I found him passionate for things he believed in, but always in a way that was endearingly self-deprecating. In that sense, it was the more effective. He did not rant or rave; he seduced you with the good humour of the argument that he put. That was one of his very great capacities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to express, on behalf of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party, to his wife Lorna, to his children Tony, Kim and Roger, and to their families, our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. Bert made a remarkable contribution to public debate in Australia. On behalf of the Liberal Party, I thank him and send my condolences to his family.</PARA></SPEECH>

Unlike the Prime Minister, I did not have the privilege of knowing Bert Kelly personally, but I guess I did know him vicariously through my father, who served with him for many years in this parliament and had enormous respect for him, and more directly through his columns in the newspapers as the `Modest Member'.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lack of rancour and that sense of humour that the Prime Minister referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister referred to his ministerial service&mdash;and I know, as a former Minister for Defence, that he was well regarded in the period he was Minister for the Navy. But I do not think he was ever meant to be a minister. If you look at his career, it was obvious that he was one of those people who would come into this place and make the rest of us feel proud to be a member of parliament, because he dealt with our inadequacies. He used the parliament as it was probably meant to be used by private members of parliament at the time of the creation of its mother in the British House of Commons hundreds of years ago. His character, which does not often appear in the Australian parliament, is more akin to those sorts of 19th century figures that we know never did ministerial service&mdash;people like Cobden and Bright. Ironically, it was their sorts of issues that in this century he essentially ran on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His contribution to this place I would say lies not so much in the policy area, if we are going to remember him in this parliament, even in debate on tariffs, but in establishing the credibility of this House as a forum that addresses the needs and interests of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He obviously touched the heart of a former leader of the Labor Party, who has taken to advising me on valedictories. I do not think I would dare leave this chamber without at least having read a portion of his letter. It perhaps goes to something that the Prime Minister referred to. It comes from&mdash;and I will not read it all because it is obviously fairly lengthy&mdash;the Hon. E. G. Whitlam AC, QC. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your valedictory for Bert Kelly on Tuesday 4 February you might like to have some material from his State Funeral in Adelaide on Friday 24 January. No private member has had as much influence in changing a major policy of the major parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">From his father W. S. (Stan) Kelly OBE, a member of the Tariff Board from 1929 to 1940, Bert imbibed a deep scepticism about the Scullin Government's policy of tariffs on request. McEwen hated him. I thought that Kelly's speeches on Tariff Board reports were much more consistently rational 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7"> than those of his colleagues or my colleagues. I naturally approved his support for my Government's 25 per cent tariff cuts in 1973.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Liberals blamed the tariff cuts for the decline of the textile industry in Launceston. At Friday's exuberant wake several Liberals enjoyed recalling that Fraser had urged Kelly to campaign in Bass. Kelly responded that he was intending to do so&mdash;for me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The State Funeral was held at Wesley Uniting Church at Kent Town. The congregation audibly approved when the officiating minister carefully enunciated the name of the first hymn "They who tread the Path of Labour"{.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bert Kelly was christened Charles Robert after his maternal and paternal grandfathers. The congregation still more audibly approved when Bert's eldest son explained the order; W. S. Kelly was not going to have an R. C. Kelly in his family.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is more in the same vein. Of course, what that indicates is evaluation by a very distinguished Australian himself of the contribution that was made by Bert Kelly to the public life of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of those occasions when I can say that we are entirely genuine in the bipartisan condolences that we offer. He was a private member much loved on both sides of the House, probably because, apart from his contribution to the honour of our profession, it was that sense of humour, that absence of rancour that so dominated the style of his contribution to public life.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and which perhaps flowed from their love of the land. In the case of Bert Kelly, it was those beautiful hills due north of Adelaide; and in the case of John Panizza, it was the country around Southern Cross.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his first speech to parliament in 1959 Bert Kelly laid down from the very outset what his philosophy was about and took a particular interest in the trade policy area. He recognised the importance of building access to markets for our exporters. In what may be an unusual but accurate picture when viewed from an historical perspective, Bert Kelly, in his first speech, actually praised John McEwen, trade minister, for the work he had completed in developing trade treaties at the time with Japan and Malaya. They were steps in the right direction, and Bert Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should like at this stage to pay a very warm tribute to the Minister for Trade, Mr McEwen, for the clear sighted way in which he has worked to do this very thing, that is, to help us sell what we produce.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was perhaps the lull before the storm, given what developed over the onward debate about tariffs and protection generally and the role that Bert Kelly took up, especially as the Modest Member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout his parliamentary career Bert Kelly clearly laid down the problems that he encountered and the many difficulties on the trading front for farmers and exporters. He made clear in his writings, in a very crisp way, a degree of irreverence in respect of government, bureaucracy and the political correctness of the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia would be a much poorer nation if it had not been for the gradual rising influence of the ideas espoused by Bert Kelly and his ability to put them forward in a way which cut through. His ability to analyse and present simply the effects of the tariff, good and bad, on our economic institutions and fortunes convinced increasing numbers of people to look more closely at policy directions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must not forget his contribution in other areas, however. They extended beyond the area of tariff and trade policy, in which it is not quite correct to say that he was absolutely one way on the issue. Indeed, a letter to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8"> editor in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> offered some further comment on that aspect. He reached out from that to also take up a range of other issues, including rail standardisation across Australia. He joined such people as the former members for Farrer, David Fairbairn and Wal Fife, William Charles Wentworth and, indeed, the Right Hon. Ian Sinclair, the member for New England, in his previous portfolio roles, in helping to facilitate the decisions in tough budgetary circumstance to provide a standard gauge rail connection, particularly between Sydney and Melbourne, subsequently between Sydney and Perth and Sydney and Adelaide, via Broken Hill and Crystal Brook. That was a very good basis which led to the final completion of the standardisation direct between Melbourne and Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, in the conversations I enjoyed with Bert Kelly as a fellow member of the Modest Members Society, it was often this subject we talked about&mdash;as was his wont and my wont&mdash;and it was very true that that key committee played a key role in jogging the then Menzies/McEwen government along the path of facilitating that key rail standardisation at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in expressing the sympathy of National Party members to the family of Bert Kelly. There is no doubt that the parliament and the nation gained a great deal from the contribution that Bert Kelly made and the example he set to all of us who have been backbenchers at various times as to how there can be real influence and real power by a dedicated and determined backbencher.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last year, when the Labor government released its mid-year review, it released a three-page press release and said, in the lead-up to a federal election campaign, that the budget was balanced when it was $10 billion in deficit. Don't you come in here and try to assert there is some kind of moral equivalence between you and us! This is the government that is putting in place legislation to ensure the level of deceit practised by you personally will never again occur in Australia. This was practised by you personally, the chief person in the lead-up to the election. You went out onto the radio waves and tried to claim that the budget was balanced and waited until after the election before you asked that fatal question about where the accounts really were. So this government swept that away.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is the great challenge for you, my friend: to at least have the decency to legislate to make sure nobody ever again tries to do what you did&mdash;a great challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we went out into the mid-year review and, in accordance with the charter of budget honesty, released 100 pages.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What are the priorities for the government for this year? What action is the government taking to ensure that pressures on families are eased, that small businesses are in a position to generate jobs for young Australians and that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the economy is managed properly instead of having periods of boom and bust?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say in response to the member for Macquarie that it is appropriate at the beginning of a parliamentary year to briefly state the government's priorities. Those priorities include continuing to regard the welfare of families at the centre of economic and social policy making. We intend to build on family tax and private health initiatives already announced, and on parenting education. Of course, we also announced towards the end of last year the launch of the pilot homeless projects, which are of particular relevance to many young Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated during the election campaign and through all of last year, providing greater incentive and greater encouragement to small business lies very much at the heart of the government's economic plans. It remains the very strong view of the government that the area of greatest job generation, particularly for the young, is the small business sector. It is the small business sector which is the hope of the side so far as future employment is concerned. It is the small business sector that needs more incentive. It is the small business sector that will begin to feel the benefit of the recent reductions in interest rates. It is the small business sector that will benefit from the abolition from 1 January of the unfair dismissal law that was visited on the small business community by the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1 July this year it will be possible for any man or woman in Australia running a small business who sells that business with proceeds of less than $5 million to invest those proceeds in another business, not necessarily a business of a like nature, without there being any capital gains tax liability. I remind the parliament of what was said by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>. Managing editor Robert Gottliebsen said that this particular announcement was the most important corporate tax reform for 30 years because what it will do from 1 July this year is transform the landscape for the operation of small business in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very happy to remind the House that the mid-year review supported the projections 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10"> of growth made at the time of the budget&mdash;growth of 3&half; per cent, which is amongst the highest in the OECD area. We now have inflation at levels that were not experienced in Australia after the OPEC oil shock in the early 1970s. We have presided over reductions in interest rates that have amounted to savings of $187 a month on an average home loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be announcing later this month the government's response to the small business deregulation task force, presided over by Mr Charlie Bell, and the measures to reduce red tape on small business will make a further contribution to boosting the incentives that are available to that sector. We will continue to build on the modern apprenticeship and traineeship scheme and the youth allowance schemes that have been announced in the first 11 months of the government being in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another great goal of the government is a sustainable future for rural and regional Australia. I am very happy to remind the House of the benefits to rural and regional Australia of the passage of the Telstra sale legislation&mdash;legislation that was opposed by the Australian Labor Party and opposed by the Australian Democrats. They fought tooth and nail not only to stop this massive injection of money into regional Australia and the consequent creation of jobs in regional Australia, but they also fought tenaciously to stop the largest ever capital investment in the environmental future of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further initiatives for regional and rural areas of Australia will flow from the work of the Supermarket to Asia Council, which brings together senior ministers and industry leaders. I say to the House on this first day that the House sits in 1997 that overwhelmingly and without qualification the priorities of this government will continue to be to help families, to boost job opportunities, particularly for young Australians, to boost small business as the engine room of job creation, and to build a sustainable future for rural and regional Australia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister said, we are talking about interest rate reductions, not only as a result of official rate cuts but also as a result of competition, which have delivered $188 a month on the average Australian mortgage&mdash;$188 a month after tax income in the hands of Australian mortgage holders.

The benefits of some of those reductions were only passed on in the last week, but that benefit of $188 per month over future months puts back disposable income into the hands of Australian families, together with the family policy that the Prime Minister has already indicated, providing through the years strong and solid growth as forecast in the mid-year review.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not aware you were going to allow it, Mr Speaker, but I am always happy to oblige the member for Holt. I do not have the specific amounts in front of me but it is an obvious point. When interest rates are raised those banks that extend the term of the mortgage generally bring the term of the mortgage back when they are lowered. So the advantage in relation to the people who had their mortgages extended when, under Labor, interest rates were rising is that they have a shorter life than they would have had, had your high monetary policy stayed in place.

That is not to say, as I acknowledged in the speech I made last Friday, as you know, that we do not regard the level of unemployment in this country as being quite unacceptable. But I have to make the point, as I made last Friday, that, when you have had a group of people who have been in charge of the government for 13 years, they push unemployment to a level of 11 per cent, they leave us with 8&half; per cent and, after we have been in office only 11 months, they have the audacity to bang the table and say, `How outrageous; why haven't you fixed it?' it is not surprising that there are a large number of people in Australia who do not take them seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>

The first of the circumstances of which I spoke is the relative strengths of the world economy, and that has been testified to not by people on this side of the House, not by people on your side of the House, but by those who normally make pronouncements on those things and whose views in the past you, ad nauseam, had quoted in support of your propositions when you were in government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What action is the government taking to fulfil its election promise to enable Australians to have a say in the careful consideration of the Australian constitution? What is the next step in the process?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="13" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can inform the House that it is the intention of the government, as promised during the election campaign, to hold a constitutional convention. This constitutional convention will be held in November or December of this year. As promised during the election campaign, half of the delegates to the convention will be appointed by the government, which will include an appropriate proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and young people between the ages of 18 and 24.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The elected people, which will comprise the other half, will be elected by a voluntary popular ballot. It is the disposition of the government at this stage that that ballot be conducted by post, although the details of that are part of the ongoing investigations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the intention of the government that the convention be held in Canberra. It will probably be held in the old Parliament House. The agenda will include issues other than the head of state, but, as I indicated before the election as part of our policy, it will be our intention to ensure that the head of state issue is dealt with separately and first and is not allowed to be sidetracked or held back by considerations of other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will also be the intention of the government before the ballot for the delegates takes place to initiate and conduct a balanced public information campaign. The information that will be disseminated by the government will be compiled in part in consultation with different groups in the community who hold varying points of view. That material will include arguments for and against the existing constitutional arrangements for a head of state as well as arguments discussing the various republican alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the House and, through the House, to the Australian people that I and the mem 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="14"> bers of the government do not regard this issue as being of anywhere near the importance of the other issues that have been the subject of question and comment in the House so far during question time. Nonetheless, we acknowledge very firmly and very forthrightly the commitment that was made before the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members of the parliament will know, I am certainly not Australia's leading republican. It is something that I have never sought to disguise from the Australian people. I was elected Prime Minister of Australia by the Australian people in their full knowledge of my views on that subject and on the full basis of a commitment I made, which I am happy to say today is going to be honoured in full. Like all of the other great commitments that were made by me before the election, this one is going to be honoured in full. I know that will be a source of enormous disappointment to those who sit opposite, but it is going to be honoured in full.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three quite serious points I would like to make to the parliament before I resume my seat. The first of those is that it does remain very much my view and the view of many in the Australian community that the existing constitution that Australia has has worked very effectively and has played a very significant role in delivering stable government to this country. It has played a significant role in the fact that Australia is one of only eight nations to remain continuously democratic through the whole of the 20th century. I do not believe that any republican system of government can deliver more stable or more effective government than can the present constitution. In other words, I do not believe that the present system of government is flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather, it remains the case that a significant number of Australians, which I recognise includes not only many people in the Australian Labor Party but also a significant number of people in the Liberal Party and in the National Party&mdash;in other words, it is a view which has considerable currency in the Australian community&mdash;hold the view that there are aspects of the symbols associated with the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> present system which are no longer as relevant as they used to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of the other two observations I would make is that it is very important that this issue not be allowed to create unnecessary division in the Australian community. I would encourage all of those who will no doubt engage themselves in this debate not to form a monopoly of Australian nationalism on one or other side of the argument. There will be passionate Australians arguing all points of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the convention is the right vehicle to discuss this matter. It will not be an issue that is going to consume our side of politics to the exclusion of other issues. I say once again that I am very proud of the fact that the commitment we made on this issue is being honoured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When all the other details related to the election of the delegates to the convention and many of the other things associated with the convention have been decided by the government, I will make a more formal and lengthy statement to the parliament. There will be plenty of opportunity for all members of the parliament to debate that, but I felt the parliament was owed advice from me as to the state of the government's thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I confirm without qualification that the promise we made on this will be honoured in full. As I said before the election, the Australian people, whose decision alone it ultimately is as to whether or not we change our system of government will, as I promised&mdash;to the opposition's great disappointment&mdash;be involved at the beginning, at the middle and at the end of this deliberative process.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. Official interest rates were cut by half a percentage point on 31 July 1996, on 6 November 1996 and on 11 December 1996. In June 1996, as a result of new entrants in the home loan mortgage market, there was a three&hyphen;quarter of a per cent reduction in margins; that is, not related to official interest rates. As the Prime Minister has already said, cumulative cuts over the course of last year of 2&frac14; per cent on standard variable mortgage rates delivered 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $188 per month to the average Australian on the average mortgage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work done by the Reserve Bank also shows that in relation to small businesses, both on variable rates and on three-year fixed rate loans, the 1&half; per cent three official cuts in interest rates have been passed on in the indicator rates offered by the banks. In relation to variable rates, there have been reductions from 11.25 to 9.75 per cent and, in relation to fixed three-year rates, there have been reductions from 10.1 to 8.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I think it is important, particularly for small businesses, that they do see their banks and that they do negotiate with their banks to ensure that they get the benefit of those cuts in official rates. The government is not working on lowering interest rates for the benefit of banks but for the benefit of borrowers. I would urge small business people to take advantage of the reductions in those rates and go back and renegotiate terms with the banks to ensure that they get the full benefit of those reductions.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="16" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Bendigo for his question. The release of the December quarter CPI figures shows that Australia has now decisively entered the low inflation league of the world. The results of the December quarter show that the all groups CPI rose by 0.2 per cent, for an annual rate of 1.5 per cent and, according to the Treasury underlying rate of inflation in the December quarter, in through the year terms, 2.1 per cent. That is at the lower end of the target which this government has set in the conduct of monetary policy, by agreement between the government and the Reserve Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefit of that policy&mdash;which this government put in place to ensure a reduction in long&hyphen;term interest rates&mdash;can be seen in the fact that the differential between the US long&hyphen;term bond rate and the Australian long&hyphen;term bond rate has shaved about 150 basis points, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and now the margin has recently been under 100 basis points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sustained low inflation is important for investment and for investment expectations in the Australian economy. High inflation tends to redirect investment into asset inflation, where people take short&hyphen;term decisions to try and make short&hyphen;term gains. A low inflation rate means that business can invest and, as a consequence, the government has recently, in its mid&hyphen;year forecast, revised business investment up to 17 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we now have is a low inflation, high investment economy. High long&hyphen;term investment is the kind of investment that is going to bring growth and job opportunities for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to concentrate on one of the other benefits of low inflation. Low inflation protects people who live off savings. Many people who live off savings will be saying that in a low interest rate climate, they are not getting the kind of interest rate returns which they are used to and which they require in relation to living requirements. But low inflation does ultimately and directly help savers. It helps them in two ways: one, prices don't move against savers. That means they don't have to try and get those types of rates of return. Secondly, it preserves the value of their savings. On a 10 per cent inflation rate, the capital value of a person's savings would halve within six or seven years. On a one per cent inflation rate, that person can be assured that the value of their savings will hold up over their lifetime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this is a climate which is right for saving. The government wants to encourage people to save. The government has put in place, and intends to keep in place, a low inflation climate which is conducive towards that and its savings which will be so important to investment and growth and job&hyphen;creating opportunities in the future.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has quite a clear view about the way in which you proceed to ensure that people have the chance of earning more and, in fact, I am glad you recited the title of our policy, because I think that really sums up the direction in which we want to see the system go, and that is, we want better pay for better work. The way in which you achieve that is you give people the opportunity to sit down at work and say, `As the employer, as an employee, how can we, at our business, run our business or change our organisation so that we run more efficiently; so that we can provide the productivity that can assure people that when they get a pay rise, it is backed up with a productivity gain so it is a sustainable, real increase in wages?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing behind this question is that it betrays your real view about labour market reform. Your real view about labour market reform is&mdash;for all your talk about reform&mdash;that you want to return to a centralised system where wage increases bear no relationship whatsoever to the productivity of the enterprises concerned. The consequence of that is there for us all to see over the last 13 years. And I will tell you who cops it the most: those that you claim to be most concerned about. Those who are disadvantaged, those who are low income earners and, on top of that, those who are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our policy is better pay for better work. The way you achieve that is to encourage people at work to sit down and do deals to suit their businesses. I will tell you what has happened in the transport industry. There are some major employers who are supporting this wage increase. Not only are they supporting this wage increase, but they are paying this wage increase already. Their intention is to go down with the union to the commission 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and seek a general, across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board wage increase so as to impose the costs which they are now paying onto other businesses, many of whom are small businesses, regardless of whether or not those businesses can afford it. And rather than those businesses being then able to employ more people or to provide their services with greater productivity and more jobs, the reality is that you actually threaten the jobs of the very people you claim to be concerned about. Not only do you deny people the opportunity of wage increases based on real productivity, you also set up&mdash;through a centralised arrangement&mdash;inflationary price pressures which will have an impact right across the economy.</PARA>

In the private sector now, less than one in four employees belong to a union. On these figures, in some industry areas only almost one in 10 belong to a union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has replaced the old union monopoly with a framework in which unions 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> must become genuinely competitive so that only unions which are genuinely representative and accountable to their members will survive. As Jennie George, the President of the ACTU, has admitted, some unions have not adequately serviced their members and unions will need to do a lot better to meet the various demands and needs of their employees. A relevant fact in this is that, as from 1 January, under the government's new Workplace Relations Act, the circumstances and the choice facing Australian employees are now much freer than they ever faced under Labor. In fact, if you are&mdash;and many Australians have been&mdash;compelled to join a union, you now have a new choice, a new opportunity, and that is that if you do not want to be in a union you do not have to be in a union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have provided very simple means for those who are in a union and do not wish to remain in a union: under the new Workplace Relations Act, they merely have to give two weeks written notice to their union so as to comply with the resignation requirements of the new act; and, provided that people also advise their employers of their decision, they can require an employer to desist from making payroll deductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it is very early days&mdash;the new act has been in place in that regard only since 1 January&mdash;I was rather intrigued by what I call the barbecue test where one person  informed me that one enterprising young person working for a major retailer in Melbourne took it upon himself to stand outside the main entrance of this particular establishment and was handing out a pamphlet. The pamphlet read simply: `Would you like a $4 a week pay increase?' Then it followed with advice on how you resign from the shoppies union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government believes that if you want to be in a union you are entitled to be in a union, and if you want to be in a union we will protect your right to be in a union; but if you do not want to be in a union we have given you an easy way out, and we will protect that right as well.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

The Australian wheat industry is very important to the prosperity of the rural sector, to regional and metropolitan communities, to the food needs of this country, to the export effort and of course to the national economy.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. As a matter of fact, this is Outlook Week 97 in Canberra&mdash;it is being sponsored by ABARE&mdash;and it really serves as a timely opportunity to remind ourselves of the importance of agriculture, fishing, forestry and mining to the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="21"> economy. In fact, these industries combined&mdash;very important for a trading nation like Australia&mdash;represent over 60 per cent of our total export wealth. Agriculture, of which some 77 per cent of production is exported today, accounts for about 23 per cent of our total export income. It is a timely point at which to consider the important role of the wheat industry in that scenario.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian wheat industry is a major exporter and indeed we are a major player on grain markets globally. In fact last year, in the drought recovery year, we saw production rise very substantially to 17.2 million tonnes, worth about $4&half; billion to the national economy. But this year we have seen a record production of 23 million tonnes for Australia. That is a remarkable performance, particularly when you think of the damage that has been done to the industry in recent years by drought, by extraordinary volatility in world grain prices and by the economic pressures that resulted from the sort of mismanagement that you people opposite were responsible for during the 1980s and the early 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite those problems, the nation's grain farmers have boosted production to record levels, particularly in relation to wheat, and they have increased their average individual turnover by 1.5 per cent per annum in recent years&mdash;a testimony to their resilience, to their innovation, to the value of research and development, and to their capacity to keep going under conditions that most Australians would just walk away from. They have made a great contribution to the benefit not just of themselves but of the nation at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of you who had a look at last week's very significant turnaround in the figures for the trade balance between November and December last year will have seen that the greatest contributor by far was in fact the wheat industry, with a very heavy shipping program. That shipping program has continued through January with record figures&mdash;an outstanding result&mdash;and that promises more good figures for us in terms of our balance of trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting too that the Australian Wheat Board, operating in a global environment of pretty heavy saturation of markets, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has been able to place such a very high percentage of such a huge crop, including, as it has done so, opening up new markets such as India.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's policies are designed to make sure that young Australians obtain the fundamental skills of literacy and numeracy at the earliest moment in their schooling.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition had no bigger promise, no bolder promise, for the people of regional Australia than their promise to bring down petrol prices. We all know that it has not taken them 12 months to stop listening to the bush. They have stopped listening to regional Australia and, in particular, they have stopped listening to the complaints around regional Australia about the government's failure to deliver on that core promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a government that has stopped listening, perhaps I could give them one little reminder&mdash;one little reminder that I noticed in a town in regional Australia. It was a letter that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Advertiser</EMPHASIS> in Leeton on 3 January. This is what one of the citizens of Leeton had to say to the coalition:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remember before the federal election seeing our local member Noel Hicks standing beside a petrol bowser promising to reduce petrol prices by 5 cents per litre as soon as his government came to power? These statements were endorsed by his leader, Tim Fischer. Since these commitments, petrol prices have increased by at least 8 cents per litre in our area.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They promised to bring the prices down by 5c a litre and they have gone up by eight. So the coalition is out by 13c a litre. That adds up to tens of thousands of dollars for businesses in the bush, it adds up to tens of thousands of dollars for tourism operators, it adds up to tens of thousands of dollars for farmers and it adds up to thousands of dollars in the working family budget around regional Australia&mdash;all because of the betrayal of the coalition on this core election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You hear some interesting stories throughout the month of January. One of the most amusing items to come out of the coalition ranks was the concept of truth in election advertising legislation. They were actually advancing the proposition of fining people who did not tell the truth at election time. I do not know if they were talking about core and non-core fines for core and non-core promises, but there is no doubt that government MPs would be paying their fines hand over fist as Australians pay more for their petrol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the record of the coalition on petrol prices? What is the record on the key promise that they gave to the people of regional Australia? There was a 2.7 per cent increase in the December quarter CPI in petrol prices&mdash;a low inflation quarter except for petrol and the people in regional Australia paying the higher petrol prices. And just yesterday we were told that that CPI increase flows through into the Commonwealth excise. So here they are collecting another $20 million when they promised to bring prices down.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="McGAURAN" NAMEID="XH4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So the Minister for Science and Technology, the member for Gippsland, shamed by the result in the state by-election, worried by the state by-election, can say that the prices are going up by a small amount, but he promised&mdash;just like the mem 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="25"> ber for Riverina (Mr Hicks)&mdash;to bring the prices down by 5c and they have gone up by eight. So what you said was supposed to come down has in fact gone up. No wonder the people in regional Australia are exceptionally outraged and disappointed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are putting the $20 million revenue from the petrol excise into their coffers. We know they need revenue to fill their Costello crater, but it should not be revenue at the expense of election promises; it should not be revenue at the expense of regional Australia. The record was particularly damning throughout the holiday period. The prices went up just before Christmas. The petrol companies knew that Australians would be travelling more, so they decided to take advantage of the holiday habits of Australian families and put their prices up by between 2c and 5c per litre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The price differential is another core promise of the coalition for regional Australia. They alone were going to lower the differential between city and country prices. We had the member for Gippsland tramping around Australia saying that he alone would narrow the differential.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is claiming that he has. Is this narrowing Gippsland style? On 2 January, Brisbane had a price for unleaded petrol of 65.9c. In Cairns it was 8c more expensive, in Townsville it was 6c more expensive and in the mining town of Middlemount near Rockhampton it was a massive 13c more expensive. So that is narrowing Peter McGauran style&mdash;a 13c differential between the petrol prices in Brisbane and Central Queensland. Now the Minister for Science and Technology is actually starting to say that the prices did not go up that much over the Christmas period. That is not what he was saying on 7 January. Let me just read from the AAP wire:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal Science and Technology Minister, Peter McGauran yesterday also criticised petrol price rises during the holiday break saying that in some cases it was blatant exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was blatant exploitation that he could not stop. He promised the price narrowing. He promised the price reductions for regional 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia and all he could do during the holiday period was agree with ALP price watch on petrol by saying that prices have gone up and that there is blatant exploitation. He was putting up the white flag. The Jaffa was putting up the white flag of defeat. He could not do anything about the exploitation, so up went the white flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this large differential was repeated later in the month. Let us have a look at the figures for New South Wales. In Western Sydney on 23 January, unleaded petrol was as low as 73.9c. If you write the figures down, Minister, you will calculate that there was a 7c differential for Bathurst and Orange, and for Broken Hill it was as high as 10c per litre. If that is narrowing coalition style, no wonder the people in regional Australia are complaining about it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here is someone saying the figures are made up. The minister is claiming the figures are made up. Obviously he has not read the press release from the New South Wales Farmers Association. Remember them? Farmers? People who work the land? Do you remember the farmers?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales Farmers Association said that petrol prices around New South Wales had risen by 2c a litre just before Christmas. Here he is condemning the New South Wales Farmers Association. Let me read it to you. I know you do not have a lot of contact with the farmers now that you have got a ministerial office in Canberra, but the press release said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Petrol prices around New South Wales rose by up to 2c a litre immediately before Christmas despite wholesale fuel prices remaining static, the New South Wales Farmers Association said.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was on 20 January. Minister, you cannot deny these things. You said it and the Farmers Association said it. People all over the country have been complaining about the price exploitation that you owned up to, waving the white flag, and have done absolutely nothing to stop. Not only that, I see that the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), the self&hyphen;styled head of the backbench committee on petrol prices, the hardest job in the government, was complaining about the price hikes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="26"> on 6 January. He said that if the petrol companies did not come into line the government would be passing special amendments to the Trade Practices Act&mdash;maybe the sort of thing I have got before the House by way of a private member's bill. Of course, he could not get too far with it because Mr McGauran refused to support Mr Lieberman's warning on the Trade Practices Act, saying that it was a long way from that. So poor old Jaffa, waving the white flag, saw the reinforcements coming over the hill and he waved them back because he thought the prices were narrowing. The Farmers Association, the member for Indi, government backbenchers, consumers and farmers all over Australia were saying those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A funny thing happened to the National Party on the way to the forum, on the way to their ministerial offices: they stopped listening to regional Australia. We all know, particularly in the Gippsland region, what it means when you stop listening. You do not need to take the word of ALP price watch on these things; the figures are very clear. The minister was saying it&mdash;until he was caught out badly and under pressure from the media&mdash;the member for Indi, the New South Wales Farmers Association, and on it went. What happened to the member for Gippsland&mdash;the minister&mdash;is that he went from being the gamekeeper to being the poacher. A few weeks later he actually joined the petrol companies; he actually became their hand puppet. Peter the Puppet McGauran is what the big petrol companies called him in Collins Street circles in Melbourne. They have got him dancing there like the Howdy Doody doll, dancing their tune. He is now saying in his press releases that he wants the big petrol companies to work with the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what he had to say about BP: that he `confirmed BP's support of the government's move to deregulation of the industry and its willingness to work with the coalition'. It is a funny thing that happened to the minister on the way to the forum&mdash;not listening to regional Australia and then cuddling up to the big petrol companies when it suited him. It is no good being a hand puppet for those companies, Minister, because the Na 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tional Party needs to make a decision on petrol. The National Party needs to make a very important choice on petrol: do you take on the petrol companies and break up the integrated control of this industry? Do you try to get vertical separation and an active wholesale market to give farmers and people in the bush their chance to access cheaper wholesale petrol or do you cave in to the interests of the big petrol companies in Collins Street and do nothing about it? The National Party needs to work out pretty quickly on this matter whether they are simply Liberals in sheep's clothing or fair dinkum representatives of people in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister was saying that he wants to work with the petrol companies, but the truth is that they have absolutely sold him the dump. They have said to the government in correspondence last year&mdash;the correspondence I quoted in question time&mdash;that the government will not be able to keep its promise of lower petrol prices. This is what the head of BP Australia had to say, talking about the government's program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will not lead to lower prices. There is a strong expectation in the public's mind that there will be reductions in the price of petrol. We do not share this expectation and believe it raises false hopes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Beyond that, the minister will undoubtedly say that he leant on BP Australia and they are now singing a different tune. Still, he cannot deny how the correspondence I have obtained from BP Australia says this: `Minister McGauran has said that the number of retail sites in Australia needs to decrease over time from around 9,000 today to about 6,000.' Have you been saying that to BP Australia, that you support wiping out 3,000&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Michael Delaney says is that you should be supporting a private member's bill that I have put before the House to open up an access regime on wholesale prices. You are setting up those service stations for very unfair competition. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="27"> Woolworths can get in for cheaper wholesale petrol and retail that around, undercutting the existing service station retailers in country Australia, but you are not willing to give the same access to the 9,000 service station small businesses that you claim to represent. Those 9,000 service stations should have the same opportunity as Woolworths to shop around for cheaper wholesale petrol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why don't you do what the member for Indi was supporting: changes to the Trade Practices Act to declare an access regime, more regulation on the petrol industry, not less, and break up the vertical integration so that you have an active wholesale market? You can actually do something constructive to bring down the prices. That is the measure that I have brought before the House in a private member's bill. The service station association has estimated that it has the potential to lower the price of petrol by 6c a litre. That estimate is supported by APADA&mdash;the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association. The industry is supporting the private member's bill that I have got before the House as the only feasible way in which petrol prices can come down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, for all your coalition supporters, dwindling as they may be, there is only one way to produce lower petrol prices: extra regulation, not the deregulation path that you are following, to actually break up the sort of control that the big petrol companies have been exercising in this industry for more than a century. You need to do a lot more than just write letters away to the petrol companies saying, `Can you do the right thing on access?' knowing full well that the petrol companies regard access as physical access only. They do not want to see any access that means competitive wholesale pricing. They are willing to adopt the status quo, all to placate a government that made a big promise and cannot do anything about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time for the National Party to deliver. It is time for the member for Riverina, who promised a price reduction of 5c a litre, to actually stand up in the House and deliver the goods&mdash;not an 8c a litre increase or the sorts of increases that you have identified over the holiday season. It is time also for the National 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Party to introduce fair competition in this industry. You should be supporting changes to the Trade Practices Act to have an access regime, to make sure that there is an active wholesale market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How unfair is it that someone can go to a Shell franchise service station today and actually be buying BP petrol&mdash;petrol that started out in a BP terminal&mdash;because the big companies are allowed to share their terminal product horizontally&mdash;that is, amongst themselves&mdash;but will not share the petrol with the retail sector, with the 9,000 service stations that want to shop around for cheaper wholesale prices? Unless there is an access regime, unless we have more regulation&mdash;not less&mdash;there is no opportunity for those 9,000 service stations to compete fairly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister can talk about closing down 3,000 service station small businesses, but for the thousands of Australians who lose their jobs, for the hundreds of country towns that are much diminished in terms of investment and employment, it is an absolute tragedy. It is an absolute tragedy that the National Party has failed so comprehensively to deliver, in tandem with their coalition partners, on this core election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope you do introduce the truth in advertising legislation because on this matter you will be paying plenty of fines, as Australians are paying more for their petrol. It is time for the National Party to decide. Are you just Liberals, dry and callous in sheep's clothing, or are you fair dinkum representatives of the bush who can actually deliver on the things you promise? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

He advises me&mdash;I accept it, as I am sure you will&mdash;that the photo you refer to in the claim that petrol prices would be reduced by 5c a litre was taken before the 1993 election, when we were to abolish petrol excise, all 28c a litre, and replace it with a GST. You cannot even get it right. Ian Sinclair was standing with him, not the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), as you allege. But let us put that aside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the claims you made during your performance. When you have 8,500 petrol stations and 400 distributors, of course you are going to get examples of inexplicable price setting, even exploitation. Of course you are. The ACCC, the government and the oil companies themselves are not going to be at each and every petrol bowser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the overall facts, because you have been badly caught out. The ACCC, the independent umpire, has examined your claims and has assessed your price monitoring. You put out a press release on 5 January&mdash;prior to that you had announced this ALP Petrol Price Watch network&mdash;which stated:</PARA>

The RACV surveyed those same areas and recorded no net changes in these locations in the month to 2 January.

<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, don't let governments interfere on an ad hoc, case by case basis. The only way the terminals can be declared under part IIIA of the act is by legislation. Has the shadow cabinet agreed for legislation to change part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act? Of course not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I will endeavour to take your words on board. It was very interesting to hear the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) slipping and sliding away from the commitments in his language prior to the last election as he travelled around Australia, he and his colleagues thumping their chests as to what they were going to do to petrol prices, especially in regional Australia, where they have failed. We have heard here today the way he has sold out. There was no commitment in what he said to this House today to bring down prices, especially to regional Australia and to my state of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contradictory comments that he did make were very interesting because that press release of 7 January of this year said that the federal Minister for Science and Technology, Peter McGauran, also criticised petrol price rises during the holiday break, saying that, in some cases, it was blatant exploitation. So on 7 January he says that it is exploitation; he now comes into the House to defend the government's position, and he does not really 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have a defence. He is really slipping and sliding away from the commitment that they had actually made prior to the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the election they were running around the country. You were running around every regional centre in this country saying, `We are going to bring down petrol prices.' I bet you that he was in the Deputy Speaker's seat of Cowper saying, `We will bring down the prices.' Well, you are not going to bring down prices and what you have said today just typifies your approach. You are running away; you are saying that nothing can be done; you are using constitutional arguments and everything else. Well, the people out in regional Australia will hear and know that you are slipping and sliding away from them. Your promise before the election is absolute rubbish and is fast becoming a joke around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania has long suffered a disadvantage compared to mainland Australia in relation to the inability of its petrol stations to compete for lower prices. This Howard government keeps preaching that competition should be a natural occurrence in a healthy enterprise system. Competition should generate where profit is taken and, in the petrol industry, it is at the wholesale level, the distributor level and the retail level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extent of competition is dependent on the financial capacity of operators to compete at each level and on their desire or need to compete. But that does not happen in Tasmania, especially in regard to their desire to compete. There is no ability to compete because the wholesalers are not interested in competition. They are quite happy with their market share in our small market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how can this government say that they are going to bring down petrol prices unless they put in place some sort of regulations to allow the retail level to pick and choose their wholesaler&mdash;the big oil companies: Shell, BP, Ampol, Caltex and Mobil? Unless they do that, unless they allow retailers and distributors, in Tasmania's case, to actually choose from which terminal they buy, you will not get competition into the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent report by the Tasmanian Legislative Council&mdash;on which a member, David 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="32"> Crean MLC, put in a lot of work&mdash;highlighted many problems facing petrol retailers in the state. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When comparing capital cities on the mainland with Hobart, based on the import parity formula, supplying fuel to Hobart should cost the oil companies roughly the same as any other capital city.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, based on the Industry Commission's calculations, the cost of that should be about 3.2 cents per litre to the oil companies. (This included administration, marketing, transport, storage.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet under the PSA, 7.4 cents per litre (this was changed in 1994 to 7.1 cents per litre) is allowed which includes 0.5 cents per litre profit. According to the Industry Commission this leaves the oil companies a 3.7 cents per litre margin. Three cents per litre of this was used in Melbourne in 1993 and 1994 to discount to other wholesalers or rebate to retailers to support retail price discounting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the same period in Hobart, the 3.7 cents per litre was taken as profit in addition to the 0.5 cents per litre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amounted to oil companies taking three to four times the wholesale profit per volume of petrol sold in Hobart compared to Melbourne on average during 1993 and 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial capacity of oil companies to compete in Hobart is not in question. The fact is they have no desire to compete&mdash;being content with existing market share, . . . AND there is largely no need to compete because competition is not forthcoming to any great extent from distributors or most retailers.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) recently helped me launch `Petrol price watch' in Tasmania to point out how difficult it is for petrol retailers to provide better prices for their customers. I totally support his suggested private member's bill that will give all service operators the legal right to shop around for the cheapest wholesale petrol. All in this House should support his bill, especially members from regional and country areas of Australia. I would have thought that there are a few people down in the member for Gippsland's electorate now starting to say&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Especially those from Gippsland West&mdash;saying, `We have been taken for granted by these Nats for too long. The McGaurans have taken us for granted down here. It is about time we had a look at what sort of service we are getting and at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whether we are going to get lower petrol prices.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government were serious about bringing the price of petrol down across Australia, then the only real answer is to give Australia's service station operators the legal right to shop around for the best wholesale price and pass those benefits onto consumers. When the Treasurer, Mr Costello, announced his deregulation plan, he talked of unleashing new competitive forces. From my earlier points, you will see that this will not work in Tasmania or in regional areas of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deregulation does nothing to help competition, particularly in Tasmania where the oil companies could not care less about competition. If anything, deregulation will allow the petrol companies to put prices up rather than down as there is nothing to stop them now&mdash;and you should know that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer did not attack the central issue&mdash;that is, legally force the big petrol companies to open their terminals to price competition. He could do this through federal legislation and by encouraging the states to bring in their own legislation. We have to ensure that there is an incentive for competition to exist among the big players. If retailers and distributors could shop around, there would be more reason for them to do something. Retailers are saying, `If we cannot shop around, we cannot compete.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The few price watches that have come in show that the only competition able to be pursued at the moment is where those retailers sell a high enough volume to be able to discount. Those stations are on the major routes, such as the Midlands Highway in Tasmania. Other stations on minor roads around the state can be some 6c higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So country people are always going to have to pay higher prices. So much for the big hullabaloo of this government prior to the last election where it was saying it was going to do this and that for regional Australia. Here is another example of where it completely bypassed the needs of regional Australia and country people. The government just walked away from them. Petrol pricing is one example. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="33">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Petrol pricing will come back and haunt the government because people out there had some faith when it said it was going to something about it. Of course today we heard the minister slipping and sliding, ringing up the excuses and making the arguments ready to abandon that policy to bring down the price of petrol for regional Australia. He has failed and I am sure he will continually fail to give regional Australia what he promised prior to the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the minister of what he said on 7 January. He criticised the petrol price rises during the holiday by saying that in some cases it was `blatant exploitation'. It is blatant exploitation not to open up those terminals to competition. The oil companies can swap their petrol from one terminal to another; therefore, it does not make any difference not to allow competition at the distribution level. Unless you can do that, you will not be doing anything about the price of petrol in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) would want the parliament and the community of Australia to believe that they have the answers for the reform of the petrol industry. They also want to spoil the efforts made by the coalition government in its first year in office to attack the problem and to do something constructive. They are spoilers&mdash;that is the best way to describe them&mdash;using inaccurate information and using information which is not authenticated. They have failed to make available to the ACCC for assessment and investigation the results of their so-called Labor price watch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember during the last parliament when these people were in government going to see and corresponding with their ministers. I took a deputation to Ms McHugh, who was the minister responsible for consumer affairs. She, as she always did, listened carefully to the plea from country members about the need for some action to be taken in the fuel industry. She said, `I am sorry, but I am not responsible; the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, is.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made sure that the submissions were passed on to the Assistant Treasurer and he 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very courteously replied. I still remember his replies. In effect, they were nothing. There was no action taken on these issues by the then government and by the party that the members for Lyons and Werriwa now belong to for the 13 years that they were in government. Where was the Labor price watch when they were in government? Where was the support and the pressure on their Minister for Consumer Affairs and the Assistant Treasurer to bring in the reforms that the member for Werriwa says will magically solve all the problems? Nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the pressure got too great and when they were unable to grapple with the problem themselves, what they did do was set up another inquiry. We do know that state and federal governments over more than 40 years have had so many inquiries into the petrol industry that we almost despair. The storage space is probably inadequate now to cope with the number of reports lying around on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let us get it into perspective. We have a new reformist government which, in the first nine months of its office, has been dealing with the deficit and the other massive problems it inherited as a result of the mismanagement of the previous government. We have also had the courage and the fortitude and the determination to tackle at the core the reforms that are needed in the fuel industry, and there are many more needed. There will be further action with the oil code, with the code of conduct, and with refining the monitoring system that we have foreshadowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just step out the dynamics of the policy. For the first time ever, the federal government has put in place a set of laws that enables access to the terminals and refineries in Australia and does away with the labelling agreement.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LATHAM" NAMEID="K26">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What laws?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XU5">Mr LIEBERMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the infamous agreement set up by the Labor Party between the Transport Workers Union and some oil interests to prevent access to the terminals. We all know that that sent broke honest country distributors&mdash;I can tell you, because I know many&mdash;who were denied access to the terminals because they did not belong to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="34"> club; that is, the organisation that had been set up by the union, the closed shop. We know that, as a result, competition at wholesale level was virtually destroyed. This government has done away with it. The member for Werriwa called out, `How? Where is the legislation?' Of course, the workplace relations legislation does away with those sorts of things. Didn't he know? It is a bit of a surprise to him. I can see the surprise on his face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second leg of our reform&mdash;and it is revolutionary to have the support and cooperation of so many organisations in Australia&mdash;is to set up an effective, authentic and credible monitoring system with the ACCC and the motoring organisations: the AAA, RACV and, I think, NRMA. All of them are under AAA. They will be assisted by many people in the community and by farming organisations. From 1 January there will be a process of monitoring on a proper basis so that any abuses, any collusion, any malpractice and any anti-competitive practices can be reported and investigated, as they must and as they should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would remind members listening to this debate that the Trade Practices Act contains penalties of up to $10 million for proven offences. This government is determined to ensure that any credible and substantiated claims that are provided to the ACCC so that they can be investigated will have the full weight of the law if they can be proven.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa has done a great mischief. He has tried to tell the Australian people that across Australia there have been movements in prices which have been improper.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other point I want to make is that as a result of the courageous announcements by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), supported by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) in these reforms, there has been unprecedented support in Australia for these reforms. Where else would you find that the RACV, the motoring organisations, the farming organisations of Australia, the umbrella organisations&mdash;AAA&mdash;have come out publicly and said, `That is what we have been fighting for.' What this coalition government has done in nine months is put in place the framework of reform for which they have been fighting for many years. What a tragedy it is that the former government did not do it. They could have. They would have had our support had they brought it in when we were in opposition. It could have been through the House within five minutes. They did not do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the point I would like to make is that for years country and city motorists have been complaining about their concern and their lack of confidence in the fuel industry distribution system. Nothing was done by the former government at all, to their everlasting shame. I would have thought that a new government would have been supported by them and they would be saying privately, `Thank God these fellas had the courage to tackle the unions. Thank God they got the IR law through. Thank God the framework is there for reform.' To their credit that is what they should have done. But, no, they go 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="35"> around spoiling; they go around misquoting; they go around trying to undermine the very essence of reforms which are so badly needed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also call on the opposition to support the oil industry&mdash;the distributors and the retailers&mdash;in their discussions to develop an oil code, which is the second phase of our reform and which has to be developed over the next few months. That oil code, if the member for Werriwa will step back and listen, will also be an opportunity for the retailers and the distributors and the wholesalers and the majors to get together and put in place a code of practice with integrity which is fair to all sides. If that is coupled with the reforms we have already introduced, it will be a further dynamic in the fuel industry distribution system in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it clear. No-one can guarantee the extent of price movement or price reductions in what I call the hydro-headed monster of the fuel industry. There are too few players, too few refineries, in Australia. We do not have hundreds of people bringing in imported fuel every day. You have to work with the clay you have.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to say a few short words in this debate because I saw and heard a lot of John Panizza in the Senate during the 10 years we overlapped there. I was personally very saddened indeed by the news of his sudden death. John was one of those people of whom you can say absolutely unequivocally that he was a thoroughly decent human being. Of course, we had our differences across the political divide, but even on an issue as highly charged as Mabo, where I remember very well that John was a very strong and persistent advocate of his own rural and business constituency, I always had the sense throughout that debate,  throughout that advocacy and throughout that fierce persistence with which he advanced the cause that he was aware of the human and the emotional and psychological dimensions of the issue for the Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The human dimension of issues was always very much present in the way in which he approached them, in the way in which he articulated his personal response inside or outside the chamber. We heard in the chamber over the years a lot of good, plain, direct, blunt speech from John Panizza of the kind that, according to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), you also heard a lot of in the party room over those same years. But that good, plain, blunt and direct speech was just about always, as I recall it, tempered with great good humour. Certainly, I can never ever remember him saying anything that was coloured by malice or mean&hyphen;spiritedness. That is not something that we can all claim in this place or anywhere else. So, very shortly and very simply, I want to say this: John Panizza was a very decent bloke, transparent, warm, honest and very human. Obviously, his family is going to miss him like hell. My heart goes out to them, but we will all miss him.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to pay tribute to a fine Australian, a man whom I came to know and had liked very much over the time since he arrived in this parliament. When John Panizza arrived in the parliament, I had responsibilities to consider policies and ideas in relation to migration and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="36"> multiculturalism. At first, John was reluctant to identify himself with his Italian background, but once he relaxed from a fairly protective attitude his sometimes rough and direct, snappy and gruff attitude was one of real pleasure to be associated with. John was a hard worker and that showed through in his character and his manner and treatment of his fellow Australians. He was very proud to be an Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think he was a wonderful man. Since I became Chief Government Whip, to deal with John on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis was something to which I looked forward. If you had a disagreement with John Panizza, he told you quickly. There were no problems about hiding things and no games being played; he told you. If he had a problem, he told you. If he felt hurt or slighted or neglected in any way, he was quickly on the phone to tell you about that as well. So, over the past 10 months, a friendship and an acquaintanceship grew which was an interesting one, because we shared a love of the land and a similar background in our growing up in rural Australia. My understanding of the wheat industry and what John had achieved at Southern Cross on his property and the fact that I had family members living in Kalgoorlie bound us together, but that was consolidated by the need for us to work together day by day, hour by hour, in the House of Representatives and the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pay tribute to John. I missed him this morning in the party room. It just seemed to me quite strange that my colleague was not alongside me there in the back row where the whips sit to time the speakers to make sure that they keep to their time limit. He guarded the stopwatch with a great deal of pride. He complained at length until we purchased one&mdash;he did not offer to buy one himself but he had complained to me that I did not have one&mdash;and when I provided it to him he seized both the bell and the stopwatch with a great deal of enthusiasm. It was his role to time our speakers, and he made remarks under his breath about lengthy speakers or speakers whom he felt were inadequate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and other honourable members in this condolence motion for Senator John Panizza. One of the fortunes of my life and that of my mother, father and two sisters was to spend a number of years in the 1960s living in Southern Cross. Some of my fondest memories from my childhood are the years I spent growing up in Southern Cross, which of course was the town in which John Panizza was born and spent his life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Southern Cross was founded in 1888, from memory. It was founded as a result of the discovery of gold, and the first great influx to Southern Cross was that of gold prospectors. In the first half of this century, there was a second great influx to Southern Cross and that was of wheat farmers. One thing that was significant about that second influx was that these farmers were, in the main, migrants&mdash;particularly from Italy and particularly from that area we once used to know as the former republic of Yugoslavia. Names such as Dellabosca, Granich and Panizza were famous then and abound in Southern Cross now and in its history. For example, in my case, a Dellabosca was my closest primary school friend, a Granich remains one of my closest friends today, and I had the honour and the privilege to serve in the national parliament as a member from Western Australia with Senator John Panizza.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot recall knowing John Panizza in my childhood, but my mother and father certainly did. My father was in the PMG. He told me on a number of occasions how he used to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="37"> repair and attend to the phones on the Panizza farm. I rang my mother and father last week to relay to them the sad news of John's sudden death. After getting over the sadness and the suddenness, my father's remark was quite simple&mdash;that John was a good bloke. My mother's remark was that this was a kind and decent man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My first recollection of meeting John Panizza was on a plane from Perth to Canberra, shortly after I became the member for Perth in 1993. I was beginning to experience the arduousness of travel from Western Australia, which the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) referred to in his contribution. John came up to me and made the point that he knew my father. We then had one of those lengthy conversations on the plane that Western Australian members will be so familiar with. What struck me about John then were so many of the attributes that people have attributed to him since his death. He was a good bloke, he was a decent man, he was kind, he was compassionate and caring, and he was imbued with a generosity of spirit. What struck me about him at the time was that there were a number of things that were clearly important to him. Southern Cross and the Yilgarn were important to him. His local government service as a councillor and as president of the Shire of Yilgarn were important to him. His Italian heritage was important to him. From my observation, perhaps the two things most important to him were his farm, of which he was entitled to be proud, and his family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September 1996, at John's urging, I attended the centenary of the local Catholic church; the church that my family attended when we lived in Southern Cross&mdash;a church known as Our Lady of Montserrat, which is nestled at the top of the rise in Altair Street. I went to those centenary celebrations with my mother and father, my sister and my young son, who was then four. In the course of those weekend celebrations, my mother and father renewed their acquaintance with John Panizza. He and I joked that, although we had not checked the record, we were probably the only two members of the national parliament since Federation who had attended St Joseph's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Catholic Primary School in Southern Cross, just across the road in Altair Street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a number of things that I observed about John Panizza in the course of that weekend. It was clear that he was loved by his family, it was clear that he was respected by members of his church and it was clear that he was very well regarded by the people of Southern Cross. In the prayers of intercession for the centenary mass, the prayers for government service and the prayers for the farming community were delivered  respectively by Councillor Charmaine Panizza and Mr Frank Panizza. That shows the contribution that John's family generally has made to those areas of activity in the Yilgarn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centenary celebrations concluded on a Sunday. John and I had to get from Southern Cross to Perth to continue the arduous journey back to Canberra, so we did so in a light plane&mdash;John, myself and my four&hyphen;year&hyphen;old son. John spent most of the time on the plane doing two things: firstly, lecturing me in the nicest possible way about the importance of family and, secondly, ensuring in the course of the short light plane trip from Southern Cross to Perth that others were taken care of before him. Those memories that I have of that weekend will be the memories that I will have of John Panizza: a good bloke, and a kind and decent man, imbued with a generosity of spirit, who was often, if not always, thinking about others ahead of himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator John Panizza made a distinguished contribution to this parliament, in the public service of Western Australia, to the town of Southern Cross and to the Shire of Yilgarn. On behalf of my family, I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife, Coral, and family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to associate myself with the comments already made by other members who have contributed to this motion. In the brief time that I knew John Panizza since my preselection in 1991, he became a very trusted friend and colleague. Western Australia is the poorer for the passing of John Panizza. He was a passionate advocate for the state of Western Australia, particularly the rural and regional areas of the vast state. He was able 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="38"> to represent his constituency with exceptional diligence. He was able to do this as a result of his success in these areas prior to entering politics, because he was a highly successful man by any definition.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not sure if John was a Kenny Rogers fan or even a country music fan, but there was a line in a Kenny Rogers song that I am sure John would have heard of. It goes: `The best you can hope for is to die in your sleep'. John Panizza deserved the best.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to honour a fellow Western Australian, colleague and friend, Senator John Panizza, who passed away in Cairns on 30 January. Much of what I am about to say has already been said, but I would like to reiterate. The Senate lost a valuable member and the Liberal Party of Western Australia also lost a very valuable and hardworking member. John will be remembered for his refreshing down-to-earth nature and his genuine concern and desire to help the people of Western Australia, in particular those from rural areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was the son of an Italian family from the northern Italian region of Sondrio, from where a number of well-known Italian migrants have come to Western Australia. John typified the southern European migrant who came to this country. Their work ethic and community spirit are legendary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming from the goldfield town of Southern Cross, just east of my home town of Merredin, the positive effect of his rural background and knowledge was twofold: firstly, he knew first&hyphen;hand the issues facing Western Australia, many of those unique to our vast state; and, secondly, his no fuss, hardworking attitude earned him the respect of people on all sides of the political arena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Panizza made a name for himself as a prominent wheat grower in the rather marginal area of the Yilgarn before entering 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the world of politics. As many members here will know, that marginal country can either make or break you. It provides seasons of immense success, excellent crops or there are long periods of drought. The Panizza family certainly knew their craft well and were very successful farmers in the area. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He thoroughly deserves the admiration he received for rising from humble beginnings to becoming a well&hyphen;respected primary producer, a local government representative and a tireless spokesman for Western Australia. His devotion to both his role as a senator and a representative of our state over the past 10 years has made him a consummate role model for new members such as me. At the previous preselection process for which Senator Panizza stood, I remember him coming to a Swan divisional meeting where he was touting for numbers&mdash;like many of the other Senate candidates. He said to me and to the Swan division that evening that, if he happened to lose the preselection, he certainly would not be off to the papers on Monday morning complaining bitterly about some job done on him. He would accept the result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having a residence in my electorate of Swan in South Perth, I was honoured to receive help and support from John during the 1996 federal election. John was determined to use his house to my advantage. He insisted on having my face, believe it or not, on his front lawn in the form of posters and signs. He was always on hand for advice. I will be eternally grateful for his encouragement during that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Panizza will be sorely missed by his Western Australian colleagues and members of the Liberal Party Australia-wide. My deepest condolences go to his wife, Coral, and his four children: Frank, Janine, Stephen and Linda.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a former party colleague of Senator John Panizza, I would just like to make a few brief remarks on the condolence motion. John was preselected and elected in 1987 as a senator for Western Australia. He was elected in the double dissolution election in that year. He was preselected at the time by a coalition of people who wanted to have a strong represen 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="39"> tative for country interests as a senator for Western Australia representing the Liberal Party. John Panizza came through that preselection process representing that particular voice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ever since his election to the Senate, I believe that John Panizza has forthrightly represented regional Australian interests. It takes a fair amount of moral courage as well as strength of character to stand up in the party room of the coalition and represent those interests when sometimes they are unpopular or at times when perhaps they do not fit in with the prevailing philosophical view. Nonetheless, John Panizza always represented those views strongly&mdash;at times he went against the general flow within the coalition parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that John rose to the position of Government Whip in the Senate reflects the standing in which he was held by his colleagues not only in the party but also generally in the parliament. He took on the job as the Government Whip in the Senate under circumstances of enormous difficulty. He had to ensure that in every single division every single senator was present. No doubt that required a tremendous amount of vigilance and attention to detail. Having served in the whips office in this place for the coalition, I can well understand the enormous amount of work that was required of him and his staff to ensure that the senators were present for all divisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a long association with John Panizza through the political process. I found him to be a decent, honourable man at all times. I read with great interest the obituary written by the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), which I thought was a first&hyphen;class representation of the work and life of John Panizza. I commend the member for Stirling for that obituary. It encapsulated what John Panizza represented not only to his own party but also to the people who viewed him as their champion. At times, when the interests of regional Australians are being forgotten or overlooked by the interests of the east coast cities, the memory of John Panizza's contribution to this parliament will shine through. He was one of those rare people who, at all 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> times, remembered his constituency. I would also like to pass on my deepest condolences to Coral and the family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add my voice to those who have spoken both here and in the other chamber on the life and career of Western Australian senator John Panizza. His sudden passing away is one that has touched us all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although by no means a close acquaintance of the senator, I had the benefit of his friendship and advice in the course of the last 10 months. In this time, I found him a man of great principle, warm and intelligent. He was the type of person who was not easily shocked, the kind of man who, I can remember thinking, must have seen a lot in his 65 years of life. Between us, there was first and foremost a recognition of a common Italian heritage, a heritage of which Senator Panizza was extremely proud. Yet it was a type of ethnic pride which is common amongst Italian Australians from rural areas. He was a country Australian through and through, passionate about rural issues while maintaining the good-natured scepticism with which most rural MPs view their city dwelling colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He would tell us that Australia's wealth came from the country, and of course he meant it. He had come to parliament to remind us that Australia's prosperity was linked to the prosperity of rural communities. I am sure that others will talk about Senator Panizza's achievements in his nine years as a federal member of parliament. He was an excellent, hardworking spokesperson for the people of Western Australia and that is a fact which has been recognised today by all members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My obligation and privilege today is simply to record what we had in common: our ancestry. John Panizza, as a trailblazer in Liberal politics, indirectly influenced the changing face of Australian politics and made the path that I, and I am sure the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro), have had to take that much easier. Senator Panizza's parents came from northern Italy, a stone's throw away from the Swiss border. People from these parts can be tough. They are determined people, resilient and extremely hardworking. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="40"> Senator Panizza's father, Robert, before coming to Australia, fought with the famous Alpini in the First World War. My own grandfather too fought in those same Alps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Robert Panizza, upon his arrival in the new land in 1921, worked as a miner in Broken Hill, Mount Isa and eventually Western Australia, where he settled in the town of Southern Cross to build a life for his new family. I once heard a radio interview with Senator Panizza in which he was asked why, as someone who had experienced racial hatred as a child, he opposed racial vilification legislation. `Because the best way of dealing with people like that is with a bunch of fives,' was his answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was typical of Senator Panizza. He would never shirk an issue. In fact in his maiden speech he invited senators on the other side of the chamber to feel free to interject if they disagreed with his comments. Where we, the city folk, would seek therapy, Senator Panizza was busy getting on with the task at hand. He became a better Australian than those who taunted him. He was a true son of his parents, a true son of his parent's land and a true son of this country of ours&mdash;Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Panizza was influenced to become a senator in part due to his fascination of the Roman senate. He studied it. He no doubt recognised the tangible power of the Australian Senate, one of the most powerful upper houses in the democratic world. But I am sure he also enjoyed the symbolism of it all&mdash;the child of an Italian immigrant sitting in the `senatus', a chamber with such clear Roman antecedents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honest people of any background are hard to come by in this day and age. We all know that people of integrity tend often to be few and far between. That is why Australia should be honoured that its first senator of Italian parentage was John Horace Panizza.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was an achiever in business, in local government, in the Senate and I am sure as a family man. He will be sadly missed by his fellow Western Australians, by those of Australian-Italian heritage and above all by his parliamentary colleagues. I offer my sincerest condolences to his wife, Coral, and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> his children. I assure them that the senator will not be forgotten.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to join in this motion and support the words that many of my colleagues on both sides of this chamber have had to say today about John Panizza, someone who will be indeed greatly missed by members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. I have to admit to a certain shock at hearing the news last Friday of the loss of John, who was not only a treasured colleague but also a very good and very loyal friend. When he said he would do something, you knew that he would stick to his word and he would get in there and do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has also been said, he was a very tenacious fighter for the state of Western Australia and he was a tenacious fighter for regional Australia. I can remember on many occasions having discussions with John. We did not always agree, but at the end of the day when the decision was made we got on and we made sure it happened. While we certainly had some common interests, a friendship developed through a respect we had for each other, many times on rural matters. As I say, when we reached agreement on these things we went ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I really respected John for, amongst many other things, was that he would support you at a time when you were in need. I can well remember a meeting that was held in my electorate in 1991 when over 1,500 very worried wool growers turned up in the Hamilton town hall. It was clear that they were very dissatisfied with what had happened in wool marketing and they were rather keen to find someone to blame for the collapse of the floor price of wool. John had heard about this through the media and duly flew to Hamilton. When I said to him, `This is a welcome surprise to see you here today.' He said, `I just thought you might have needed a little bit of help so I thought I'd come along.' That was typical of John Panizza, that was the sort of effort he would make for colleagues and that is one of many examples of what a very fine man he was and what a very fine Australian he was.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="41">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard many people already speak of his decency, his honesty and the fact that he was very much a straight talker, that you always knew where you were with him and that he was a very effective representative for the state of Western Australia. Others have talked about his success in public life and through his support of his family and through his achievements prior to coming into parliament, many of which he continued while he was still in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also had the pleasure and honour of John taking over from me as the acting shadow minister while I took a holiday in 1993. I rang him when I came back from holidays and everything was running smoothly. John had made sure that nothing had got out of control and it was a pleasure to know that in those sorts of situations everything had been placed in safe hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel that last Friday we lost a very loyal friend, a very fine Australian and a very respected colleague. Like others, I too pass on my deepest sympathy to John's wife, Coral, and their family. We have lost a very fine person.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join my colleagues in making a few comments about Senator Panizza. Much has already been said today about the fact that his family were migrants to this country. Senator Panizza is the sort of person that we should hold up as an example of the tremendous opportunities that people can rise to when they come to this country. Senator Panizza was a very successful man, but success never got to his head. He never let it get the better of him. In all the time that I knew John Panizza, he was a man of the people and for the people. His first responsibility was to his family, to his state and to his country. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I got to know John Panizza very well during many years of campaigning. Throughout that time he never once shied away from the principles that we in the Liberal Party stand for or indeed what any representative to this parliament should be upstanding for. Principle was something that was far above anything else in his attitude to life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something else that stood out about John Panizza was the fact that he continued to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believe, despite being a very successful man, that hard work would result in just reward. It is well known that that is true in his case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The good thing about John Panizza was that he never belittled anyone. No matter who you were or what you might be aspiring to, John took you for what you were and he admired you for whatever qualities you had. He was also a very well respected man not only in his home state of Western Australia but right around Australia, as many of my colleagues have already said today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was always prepared to give advice. You might not have liked what he told you but, upon reflecting on what he said, you would find it was probably very good advice. For those of us who were not always prepared to accept that advice, it may perhaps have been something that we should have listened to much more closely at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that many other colleagues wish to add to the comments that have already been made, including mine. On behalf of my family and the people whom I represent&mdash;I know a large number of people in the Italian community of my electorate of Canning will be very saddened at the loss of Senator Panizza&mdash;I pass on our sympathy to John's wife, Coral, and his extended family.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;John Panizza was a member of the Senate who was probably the first example of a recognition within the Liberal Party in Western Australia that within its rural constituency, which is very substantial in terms of its membership, were people of the qualities of John Panizza who could bring both the experience of a rural background, the experience of doing it pretty hard in their youth, along with all the other skills of able business management that one might find in St Georges Terrace and a great understanding many Australians who had come to Australia post the Second World War have. But his preselection was particularly a move towards recognising the rural constituency of Western 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="42"> Australia by way of nominating people to the Senate when their representation was otherwise limited by the number of seats covering rural Western Australia&mdash;and, as I stand here, there is basically only one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was given a task. He was followed by Winston Crane and Alan Eggleston&mdash;similar people who bring a very broad experience to the parliament but, added to that, an understanding of the problems related to the rural and remote area constituency. In preselecting John, I do not think the Liberal Party could have made a better choice from a large number of candidates who had that sort of background, because he was outstanding in terms of his personal abilities and his personal understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to emphasise that point because in many discussions with John I came to understand how well he understood what life was like on a farm such as Southern Cross in those early years. John would have lived there around the time of the Depression. Southern Cross, which has been very bountiful in terms of its agricultural productivity in recent years, is pretty tough country. You have to have a great deal of courage, irrespective of your wealth, to go out, as the Panizzas do, and put in 25,000 to 30,000 acres of crop in an area where sometimes it just does not rain. It is, by anybody's standards, marginal country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That the Panizzas have made a success of it is further evidence of just how committed and dedicated they are. On my last visit to their property, which was some time ago, they were harvesting and it was the brothers, the family, who were out there on the machines notwithstanding that over time they had become extremely successful and no doubt could have afforded to pay someone else to do that job. But that is the type of people the Panizzas are: committed to their own farm. It is no secret that John's wife, Coral, still preferred living on the farm to the luxuries of Canberra or even the city where John had established his office as a senator for Western Australia. They are great people&mdash;greatly committed to their area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only say how surprised&mdash;in fact, shocked&mdash;I was to be acquainted with the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> news of John's death. If anyone had asked me to write a list of my colleagues who might die, I would have put myself well and truly above John Panizza. He was a little older than I, but he always appeared so fit and looked after himself, which I never have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sorry time that someone whom I saw as having still a very long future in politics, let alone life, has left us in that way. As I have just said, Coral's preference was still for the farm and the family, but I am so pleased she was with him when he died. John was fortunate in the way he went. I am just devastated for those he has left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John and I had an interesting political career. It is a pity the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) has left the chamber, because he still talks about the time when he, Jim Short, John and I went to Merredin, which is the heart of grain growing country within my electorate and not far from Southern Cross. We went to discuss John Kerin's proposal to deregulate the domestic wheat market. John Panizza and I were on opposite sides of the fence on the issue. John was an extremely conservative wheat grower in wheat grower political terms. John did not want anything to change. I felt the issue was a bit different. The audience was giving me a particularly hard time. It was interesting for David to see the way those sorts of meetings could be conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that did not alter John's and my friendship. He felt that the wheat growers' interests would be best represented by the status quo; I felt that their interests would be improved by what the government at the time was proposing. We both put our views, with varying degrees of support. I think John had more supporters than I did, but we did it as friends. The member for Wannon has just returned. I am sure by the smile on his face that he remembers the day. Jim Short went out of their staggering. He had never seen the likes of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it was great politics, and it was two members who were always prepared to represent the interests of their own constituents. On that occasion, we had a philosophically different point of view. In later years, John shifted closer to my point of view in that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="43"> regard, but he always acted on the basis of what he thought was best&mdash;in this case, for wheat growers. That is why he stood tall in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what we are all here for. We are not always going to have the same view as to how our people are best represented. John was certainly prepared to argue the case in their interests as he saw it. I think he continued throughout his career that way. He will, therefore, be sorely missed within the Western Australian electorate and Australia. He always worked that way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In listening to the condolences that have already been delivered in this place, I have heard people talk about John Panizza having known him for a longer period than I did. I knew John, as a senator, having served with him in the Senate, since we came in together in 1987. Friendships were made in that year between those of us who came in together. I came to know John as a man who would always put it very straight. He was never a person who would dissemble. If he had a point of view, if he had something to tell you, he told you straight to your face and then you got on with the discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a man with whom I campaigned. When I think of him, he was a man of 65, which I will call a young man, who still had a lot to give and a man who had said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that a man must show that he can manage his own affairs and preferably risk his own dollar before offering himself for higher office and thereby shaping the future of other people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was a man who believed that very much. He was a man who practised what he preached and who came into the parliament and gave 10 years. But he had many more years he could have given. It was the wisdom of what he had learned in doing other things, the wisdom that he had from experience, that was of benefit&mdash;learning from his parents 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about hardship and about hard work, dedication of purpose and bringing up a family in principles in which you believe. That is what he believed was good for the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With John's passing we will miss from this parliament a man, whom I considered a friend and whom others considered a friend, who led by example. In public life, where we are so often criticised as perhaps being self-serving, or whatever the general terms we are criticised in, John Panizza was a man who came because he wanted to give service, who was true to the principles that he had experienced through his life and who argued in a debate from that experience. The parliament was richer for his being here. It is also the poorer for his leaving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To Coral, his wife, and his children, I extend, along with everybody else, my most deep and sincere condolences and deep and sincere sympathy. I trust that they will know that within the Liberal Party there is still a place for them to be remembered and valued and be part of our community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Respect is a word that is not often used in relation to politicians or politics. But certainly, from the contributions today from my colleagues, it is clear that Senator Panizza had a lot of respect from his colleagues&mdash;and that has certainly been evidenced by the number of people putting their condolences into the newspapers in Western Australia&mdash;and that respect has been shared by a lot of other people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fist came across Senator Panizza by knowing the Panizza family from Bunbury and Albany. Although distant relatives, it seems certain that the Panizza family has influence in a lot of farming areas from Bunbury right around to where John and his brothers were successful at Southern Cross. I have always thought John was successful. The best definition of success I have heard is that success is the continual realisation of a worthy ideal or goal. John had clear ideals and always worked towards those ideals. John also had clear goals and always worked to maintain those goals. Based upon that definition, Senator John Panizza was very success 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="44"> ful not only in this place but also in his life outside of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) alluded to the fact that he often flew with John to and from Western Australia. At certain times of the year John would look out the window as he crossed the Western Australian coast, looking for clouds. He would quite rightly say whether it was raining or not and things like that, concerned about his crops. He was well respected for his crop growing and farming in that area and certainly paid clear attention to the weather as he was flying into Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was very proud of his Italian heritage. I often went to the Italian club with John. Four and a half per cent of the members of my electorate have Italian heritage. John showed me the strange nuances associated with the Italian community. We were often the only two Liberals at Italian functions. There were usually about 12 Labor members of parliament there. John was always there and he would always encourage me to come along as well. He was clearly highly respected at the Italian club and within the Italian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was also well regarded as a hard campaigner when it came to elections. If I remember rightly, six months before the election campaign, he was one of the few people who said that we had a chance of winning Brand. He said that the opposition leader, Mr Beazley, would be in trouble. Sure enough, it proved the case in March last year that he was in trouble, although Mr Beazley crossed the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been very hot in Cowan during the last two federal election campaigns. On hot days you sometimes need help with campaigning. Often when I asked John to help with doorknocking in Cowan, he would always turn up on the hottest days because he was always thought that there would not be the support of others on such days and that the time to help was when others were not around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a very vague rumour in 1995 that John's preselection would be under threat. As so often happens in politics, people put these things out in the marketplace to see 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what sorts of comments come back and then determine what action needs to follow. There was a very serious reaction within the Liberal Party regarding those rumours. John overcame those rumours totally. The country constituency of the Liberal Party certainly supported John very strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sad loss to lose John Panizza. I used to enjoy travelling with John back to Western Australia. We would have many a fine chat about various issues, including football. His nephew, a friend of mine, was coaching the Claremont football team. John will be sadly missed. On behalf of my own family, who knew John, and those associated with the Cowan electorate, I offer my condolences to the whole Panizza family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise along with other members to briefly pay a tribute to Senator John Panizza. May I also take the liberty of recognising the fact that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, have chosen to remain in the chair and so allow me to pay this tribute. You have done so out of your own respect for Senator Panizza and your desire to participate in this debate, albeit not verbally, because of the work you had done with him on the Standing Committee on Publications. I share with you and all other members of this chamber a real sense of loss and a sense of having lost a friend, although I had only known Senator Panizza for the last nine years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that has been said by all other members of the chamber, referring to his tenacity and his courage, are sentiments I endorse. There is no doubt that Senator Panizza was very proud of his Italian heritage. There is no doubt that he was very proud of his father and of the success that his father had, first as a miner and then as a pioneer farmer in that difficult country in the Southern Cross area. There is no doubt that he was very proud of his family and each of his sons and daughters. There is no doubt that he was also a successful senator and a successful farmer who took a great deal of pride in the family properties and was anxious to ensure that the latest techniques were engaged as part of their farming practice.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="45">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all of those achievements, for all of the capacity that he brought into this parliament and for all that he had done outside of the parliament in local government and in farming to make a name for himself, I will remember him most as an unassuming and self-effacing person who was likeable because, in spite of all his success, he was so unassuming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I worked closely with Senator John Panizza on the primary industry committee, a role that I shared with both the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). They have made much reference to Senator Panizza's role on that committee. As chairman of the coalition primary industry committee, there were a couple of issues on which Senator Panizza and I disagreed, but I never left a meeting of that committee with any sense of division, for that was not part of the Panizza nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know Mrs Coral Panizza or the family well. While nothing that we will say in this chamber can relieve them of the dreadful sense of separation that they must feel at this time, I hope it will be of some comfort to them to know that we grieve with them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to echo the sentiments of a number of members who have spoken on the condolence motion for Senator John Panizza. I want to add my own words as well. I was in Western Australia last week on some committee business when I heard the devastating news. I was only two doors away from his office, so I was overcome by a great sense of sadness that he should leave us so suddenly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John made a very valuable contribution to the Senate and also to the country since his election in 1987. As the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) has alluded to today, Senator Panizza was very proud of his Italian heritage. To have entered the Senate was indeed a milestone for him, a feat which I can truly relate to, having been the first female of Italian origin to enter the House. It must have meant a great deal to his family and to his parents to have him achieve that great honour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Panizza, in the short time that I did know him, was always willing to share a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> story with me. Stories about his early days and the struggle that he and his family had to endure were really inspiring. I recount a particular story about the war. Members of his family would go across to another farm with their lanterns shining and quite often they would be picked up by the authorities, who thought that they were signalling to the enemy who were flying overhead. I found that quite an amusing story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He played a very significant part in government at all levels, particularly at the local level from 1975 to 1987 and from 1982 to 1987 on the Yilgarn Shire Council. During those particular years he got involved in town planning issues and transport and works. I guess the years in council prepared him well for his future life in federal politics. He learned about things at a grassroots level, about the things that really affect people and about the local things that matter. It was this strength, gained so hardily from his experience in local government, which brought him to federal parliament and to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The senator was a very successful farmer and property developer. He was always down to earth and a very straight shooter. He had an honesty that I admired greatly. He was brought up in the school of hard knocks and his parents, as migrants to this country, worked very hard to make ends meet. They instilled a great deal of self-confidence in him and certainly initiated a lot of the drive that he had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Panizza was active in a lot of Senate activities. A number of members have spoken about his work on the standing, legislative and general purpose committees. He was a very informed voice for the people of Western Australia. As the people he represented came from all walks of life, the senator in turn ensured that in his career in the Senate he became involved in as many issues as he could that were at the very heart of his constituency. His committee work is legendary. People have already alluded to his great personal involvement: he put his heart and soul into everything he did. He brought to all his duties a great sense of purpose and dignity and there was a commitment with everything 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="46"> he set out to achieve. He was regarded well by both sides of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a new member, my impressions of him were that he was a tireless campaign worker. I remember an occasion not so long ago where he came from Western Australia to support me in a fundraising function, for which I truly admired him. He was a straight shooter. He was always willing to give you advice and as a newer member that is welcome sometimes, I have to admit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was sharp witted and his sense of humour was something to behold. He always had the time to sit down and talk to you about whatever you wished to discuss. I will remember him warmly for his conversational skills, his ability to make anyone feel at home, his warmth and his generosity. The importance of his family always came through in those discussions with me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Panizza is survived by his widow Coral and their children. I am sure that they will continue the ideals which they have learned from him and which he pursued throughout his life. On behalf of myself, my family and the people of Petrie, I extend my deepest sympathy to his family and to all the friends of Senator Panizza.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was deeply saddened to hear the news of the passing of my colleague John Panizza. Indeed, he was a man who managed a very rare combination of humility, confidence and commitment to the causes that he felt passionate about, and he did feel passionate about many causes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the opportunity to read through his first speech to the parliament. That indicates his wide-ranging concerns about his constituency. He was a great advocate for mining, for the pastoral region and for the fishing industry, and he recognised the importance of a strong economic base and the role that those industries played, particularly those from his own state of Western Australia. He was a man who knew and always remembered where he came from. In his maiden speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One thing I will always remember is where I came from. I am the son of Italian migrants. One must put on record the important contribution made to this country by such people. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not only was he passionate and committed about the role of industry, the pastoral industry in particular, to this country, but he also had great compassion. He understood the importance of the contribution that migrants made to this country. He also acknowledged not only the hard work of his father and those who came around the time of his father to this country but also the women who followed the men into the harsh conditions. I suppose I have some understanding of some of those conditions Senator Panizza's family had to deal with because my uncle had a farm in the same farming region that John Panizza's father farmed in and that he no doubt spent a great deal of time in as a child. I used to spend holidays there and I know how tough it was on my aunty and on the other women in that region. I also recognised the hard work done by the men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His humility was always demonstrated in his compassion, his sympathy and his understanding for his fellow man. Clearly, as a migrant he had from time to time encountered discrimination. He makes a point, in fact, that there was a lot of discrimination and that migrants to this country had met with hostility. In his maiden speech he made a point of saying `if the Aboriginal people feel that they are still discriminated against&mdash;I know they are&mdash;they have my sympathy, because I know what it is like'. So he was also a man of great compassion and, as I said, a man of humility. I think the thing that touched me the most in his first speech to the Senate was that he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we move to the celebration of Australia's 200th anniversary&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">this, of course, was given in October 1987&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I express the hope that we can at last be one nation, whether our skin happens to be green, yellow, black or white and whether we are descended from the convicts, the aristocracy, the Aboriginals or European migrants. Hopefully we can be one people under the same flag which, amongst other things, carries the emblem of the Southern Cross. That is my home town.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think he is an inspiration for all of us to remember&mdash;to remember where we came from, whom we serve and our responsibility and our role not only to forward the economic progress of this country but also to continue to address the human issues. I know that I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="47"> will personally miss the association I have enjoyed with the senator and I think, indeed, the world is worse for his passing. I extend my deepest sympathy to Coral and to his family on this sad occasion.</PARA></SPEECH>

Someone described John Panizza earlier as being a straight shooter and that is how I describe John Panizza. You always knew where you stood with John. He would tell you exactly what he thought with no mucking around. I could describe John as a rare breed in politics at any level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a great ambassador for Western Australia&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;and for the Liberal Party. I admire John Panizza. I admire John Panizza for his hard work, for what he achieved, for being an astute businessman both as a farmer and a property investor. But he was always a very grassroots person. My colleagues have said that his success, driven by that hard work and the hard work of his family, never changed John Panizza. That is what I liked about John. He was a straight shooter and very much down to earth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that his family, Coral and his children, will suffer a very great loss at a time when they, John too, should have been looking forward to a period of enjoyment after John's remarkable achievements: local success in business, farming, local government, election to the Senate and then the achievement of the office of whip. John was a fit man, a hardworking man and, as I said, a tremendous advocate for Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found that John was not a person driven by any lobby  group or industry organisation. John had the uncanny ability to cut through to know what the community was saying and was not the mouth of someone else. He well and truly portrayed the view of people. As I mentioned, he will be sadly missed. He was a straight shooter. You always knew where John was coming from. Success, even his success as a senator, never changed John. We all in the Liberal Party admire John for that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all of us, in those long trips backwards and forwards, it was more enjoyable&mdash;in the days when I and John Panizza first got in together&mdash;when the Senate and the House of Representatives used to get up together. I think the previous government probably wisely changed those rules. In fact I am sure the airlines said, `If you keep it up you will destroy our passenger loads on those segments when senators and members got up together.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can always recall, for those of us who knew John very well, that when the previous Prime Minister made those remarks about the Senate and described them as `pansies' and John walked on the plane and some of us said, `Good heavens, is that one of those pansies walking on this plane?' of course we got a very quick response from John Panizza because one thing you could never call John was a pansy. He was a tough bloke, a straight shooter and a hard worker. He was a good bloke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will be sadly missed by the parliament, his constituents but, more importantly, he will be sadly missed by his wife and his family. On behalf of me and my wife, Shirley, I do pass on my condolences to Coral and to their family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add a brief contribution to this condolence debate. I had not really met John Panizza significantly before I came to parliament. I had my closest association with him, I think as many others did, on aeroplanes. He was always a pleasant companion to travel with, and that is saying something because often the trips are four and five hours long and not many people pass the four or four hour test. He did with flying colours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a man of truth, a very upright person, who always behaved in exactly the same manner no matter what the environment. Mr Speaker, you will have seen him in the party room. You will have seen him on close circuit television in the Senate. I have seen him in other environments&mdash;in Liberal Party meetings in Western Australia. He was exactly the same person wherever he was. He always spoke his mind. He always argued his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="48"> case as well as he could and he always put the public interest to the forefront in everything he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He and I share one factor in common. I was born and grew up in East Fremantle and have been effectively a lifetime supporter of the WA Football League in East Fremantle. He was much more closely associated with the club than I over a long period. I was not aware of that until relatively recently. But his closest association in WA was obviously with the Southern Cross area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I attended the annual general meeting of the Liberal Party branch in Southern Cross at his invitation and it was a sight to behold. Politics were extremely well organised in Southern Cross. Most of the people who were on the committee seemed to have either one of two surnames. One of them was Panizza and the other was another name of Italian extraction. They ran the Liberal Party in Southern Cross very effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John had very strong support in that area&mdash;in fact, in all of Western Australia. He had very strong support in the Liberal Party in Western Australia and he returned that support with the efforts he put in. I, too, extend my sympathy to Coral and the family.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add a few words to those of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) made early this afternoon. I have known Bert Kelly for nearly 30 years and his wife and some of his children for some of that time. I do not really remember him in the parliament, but I do remember him for most of those years at rural meetings of one sort or another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I knew, as most of us did, that the first man on his feet at the end of a speech that he did not like would be Bert Kelly, that he would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have a biting, short, succinct question but that that question would come at the end of a long, disarming, smiling, preamble which would go on for just as long as the chairman allowed&mdash;and I have known it to have gone on for 15 or more minutes. But I think one of the great attributes of Bert Kelly in putting his view&mdash;and it was always about protection, which he did not like at all, and, I might say, about protection in the agricultural industries, which he was very fond of as well, so he was not just taking on the manufacturers or his conventional enemies&mdash;was always that he did it so pleasantly, so smilingly and so disarmingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I happened to agree with the general thrust of his argument but, whatever you thought, you could not escape the smile and you could not escape the dedication to the subject and his mischievous way of getting the point over, sometimes to the discomfort of his friends. I think it is a well&hyphen;known story that, in 1975, Bert Kelly called a quorum while he was speaking, as the Melbourne Cup was in the process of being run. The Labor government was forced to attend while the opposition watched the completion of the race. I am told that Fred Daly, who was known for his occasional flutter on the horses, never forgave Bert for that and was heard to say so on many occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, in the following year, when the Melbourne Cup had been won by a New Zealand horse, Bert asked a question without notice in the House. He did not have time to forewarn the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, who is now the Prime Minister. The question was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the consistently strong competition from New Zealand, will the Minister see what can be done to put a tariff on New Zealand horses in order to prevent them running faster than our home&hyphen;produced horses?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Howard said at the beginning of his answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question catches me very much off balance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So much so in fact that Speaker Snedden, at the end of the minister's reply, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am afraid the Minister weighed in light. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="49">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So Bert got his point over extremely well, as I said, sometimes to the discomfort of his friends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think he has had more influence on the discussion over protection than anybody else since the war and, as he exercised most of that influence by either writing in the dailies or rural journals or as a backbencher, that is no mean feat. Perhaps I could just finish by saying that in the last part of one of his books he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I left parliament at the end of 1977 I naturally thought that I would not receive many invitations to speak at meetings . . . Recently I was preening myself because speaking invitations were still coming in and when Lorna&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">his wife&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">brought me down to earth by saying that the main reasons for these invitations was that I had a Gold Pass, so people knew that they did not have to pay my travelling expenses, I am afraid she is right, as usual.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I did not disagree with Bert Kelly very often, but I disagree in part with that view because really it was the very entertaining, delightful but very strong way that he put his argument that got him invited to many of those meetings. Perhaps the gold pass helped, but I think it was probably in that order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having been to the funeral service last week, at which 300 or 400 people turned up&mdash;and, as we have heard earlier, some very eminent people at that&mdash;I know those people were very pleased that they were able to get there.

Bert was already too ill to be able to attend, but I had had the privilege of talking with him over many years as a parliamentary staff member and as a member of parliament. When I organised a seminar of the Modest Members in 1995 in Sydney, he was there even though it was then evident that his health was failing. If he could come, he would come. That was one of the great things about Bert, that even when he left parliament he never lost that determination to support the causes that he believed in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is probably a mistake to attribute too much influence to one man, even someone as persuasive as Bert Kelly. There were, after all, very powerful forces pushing Australia towards trade liberalisation internationally, and other influential players on the Australian scene. But, when all is said and done, Bert Kelly's influence in the parliament and the inspiration that he gave to other contributors to the policy debate was very large. The strength and character of purpose that enabled him to do this was exceptional. Perhaps it can be traced to his Methodist upbringing in South Australia, perhaps to the fact that his father, W.S. `Stan' Kelly OBE, had been a full&hyphen;time member of the Commonwealth Tariff Board from 1929 to 1940. The board, after all, had been established to protect the public from the pressures of special interests&mdash;that was the purpose of the Tariff Board, not to hand out tariffs indiscriminately&mdash;and I am quite sure that Bert imbibed a lot of perspectives and principles from his father at the family dinner table over the years. Doubtless it was this sort of background that made him alert to the moral problems that arise when politicians start making decisions to advantage one section of the community at the expense of all the other sections of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that Bert's great achievement was to demonstrate the commonsense of lower tariffs and freer trade. This was an extraordinary achievement because, as the Prime 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="50"> Minister (Mr Howard) said earlier, this was directly contrary to the conventional wisdom at the time when he began to pursue these issues. He did not pursue lower tariffs and freer trade as a theoretical position. He left that to Eccles in his columns. He always took the very practical position that lower tariffs would deliver real and very obvious benefits in the form of lower costs and expanded demand for the products of his farming constituents and others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mavis, the long suffering politician's wife&mdash;and we all have our Mavises, I suppose, one way or another&mdash;Fred, his farmer friend, and Eccles, his academic adviser who championed cool analysis over emotion: these characters really charmed the many thousands of readers of his column `Modest member of parliament'. In that column, time after time he assailed the fantasy that high tariffs can create sustainable jobs. He showed again and again that tariffs just forced consumers and families to give more of their money to some fortunate beneficiaries at the expense of jobs in other businesses and that those who suffered most from the inflated prices produced by tariffs were the lower income sections of the community&mdash;many in the farming community, those on benefits, pensioners and retired people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, after several decades of Bert's influence, we recognise that there are very few jobs in the Australian economy still dependent upon tariffs. The jobs that are coming into existence at the moment are jobs which can stand on their own in the global economy. Australia is stronger and more secure as a result. We have Bert Kelly to thank for that. I think we all owe a great debt of gratitude to him for his persistence and his strength over those years. I extend my sympathy to Lorna and to Bert's three sons&mdash;Anthony, Roger and Kim&mdash;on their loss.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like others in this House, I knew and liked Bert Kelly. Unlike those others who have spoken, I really saw him and worked with him in the parliament and in the party room. I really wanted to give a little bit of the background that has not come out in the contributions to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I think it needs to be remembered that for a long period in the Menzies government the debates in the party room were at least as significant as in the parliament. As our own Prime Minister (Mr Howard) commented this morning in our own joint party room, Sir Robert&mdash;certainly as Mr Menzies&mdash;with his eyebrows rather dominated the proceedings. There was quite a marked gulf between those who had been senior ministers over the years and people like Bert Kelly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another facet of that period was that the Tariff Board was constituted as a dispassionate and independent body, designed to allow the consideration of the level of tariffs and to do it on a basis which took account not only of economics but also of employment and, supposedly, the economic consequences of any tariff that might have been proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert Kelly&mdash;certainly from his father but also through his association with Alf Rattigan, Dick Boyer and others on the Tariff Board&mdash;inevitably, in the party room as in the parliament, presented a case that was not emotional. It was not just presented on the bare facts of the theory of whether or not there should be a tariff. Probably to greater degree that I suspect many in this House these days do, he picked out the detail, analysed the figures and analysed the product of any recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed John Stone mentioned in his column the other day Bert's contribution to the debate on many occasions was at least as good and often better than the Tariff Board recommendation. Bert had the advantage of having read the tariff report. Having picked up those people who made contributions to the board, he would contact them and go through the issue. By the time the debate was presented, either in the party room or in the parliament, it was always just slightly better than the report itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed the Prime Minister in his observations talked about Bert and his wry humour in his contributions. Quite often when there was a Tariff Board debate there was very little humour because, as a result of Bert's analysis, it would be strictly a numerical presentation and one that was not always easy to follow. The conclusions and the way in which he reached those decisions certainly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="51"> demonstrated a very soft mannered but determined and persuasive person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is little doubt that Bert was very much the parliamentary voice of those who felt that the time had come for a fundamental revision of Australian tariffs. I think all of us who worked with him admired and respected the way he pursued, both in the party room where there were significant political heavyweights against him and in the parliament, a cause which was not always popular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I want to briefly mention that Bert was always very deprecating in the way in which he presented himself. Several have mentioned his humour, and his Modest Member column was there was for us all to see. I can remember quite well some occasions when we had some quite strong debates in the party room about naval acquisitions. I remember one of the members had made a fairly profound argument about the case for bigger ships for the Australian navy. Bert said, `I do not know. I suppose an admiral needs a decent cabin, but I did think there were other reasons why we bought battleships and warships.' He also commented, `I suppose even admirals need something to play with in the bath.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way in which he approached what could be a fundamental decision&mdash;in this case, it was looking at future acquisitions for the Royal Australian Navy&mdash;was by deprecating himself by his understanding of the subject and then suddenly showing not only did he know all about it but also he was on top of the numbers and on top of the argument. As a result, his case was always very persuasive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I note the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in his observations suggested that Bert should never have been a minister, I think one of the advantages that Bert had as a minister was that he was actually able to put in place that very significant analytical capability that characterised so much of his performance. In his contribution the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, mentioned Bert's interest in the standard gauge railway. One of the things Bert did was not only look at the employment and at the tariffs but also look at the infrastructure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert was one of those who very forcefully advocated a total analysis of the costs of production and delivery. As a farmer, of course, he was only too well aware of the cost of delivering grain and other produce in South Australia, but he certainly was a very forceful advocate to have on side as I had at the time of the completion of the Indian Pacific and the Trans&hyphen;Australia standard gauge railway. Bert was one of those who also helped in the development of the standard gauge railway to Alice Springs where, again, we badly needed to look at the cost of providing a service which at that stage was grossly inefficient and, in parts, was subject to flooding which delayed the service to an inordinate degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regarded Bert Kelly as a great Australian. He certainly made a contribution in parliament. He made a contribution in the party room. As a journalist, as several have said, I think his memory will live long because he wrote precisely, concisely and to the point. I would also like to extend my own personal sympathy to Lorna and his family. As I did not speak to the John Panizza motion, I would also like my personal sympathy to go to Coral and her family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was honoured to represent the Speaker at the funeral service for Charles Robert Kelly, which was held in Wesley Uniting Church, Kent Town, on 24 January. Bert Kelly was a former member for Wakefield, as everyone knows. I suspect he was one of those South Australian federal members of whom the whole state is proud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert Kelly was unique, and he was unique for one reason: he entered this parliament, the national parliament, with a national perspective. I suspect most of us tend to come here having to acquire a national perspective, but Bert came knowing what the nation needed. He was determined to pursue what he felt was in the nation's best interests ahead of what may have been an immediate parochial interest. His objective was national. He entered the parliament with a national view of Australia, and that in many ways made him quite unique.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="52">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He always claimed to have been a reluctant politician. Any who have read his books will know that he said he was drafted into Wakefield and that, in fact, he did not even know whether he was a member of the Liberal Party or not when he was first invited to stand. I suspect there may be just a little editorial licence in all of that. I also suspect that, while he may claim to have been a reluctant politician, the truth is he loved this place and he loved his role as the member for Wakefield. What happened, remarkably, was that he never ceased to be a farmer. Whether he was a minister of the Crown or a well-known columnist and journalist, he was first and foremost a farmer representing the farmers of Wakefield and identifying with the family property Merrindie, which is near Tarlee in South Australia's mid&hyphen;north.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would call Bert Kelly my mentor. He came into this parliament, however, with a mentor of his own&mdash;Charles Hawker, who had been a former member for Wakefield between 1929 and 1938 when he was tragically killed in an aircraft disaster over Melbourne. Charles Hawker was a courageous and unselfish politician who had been severely wounded during World War I and who represented Wakefield vigorously in spite of his severe war wounds. He had a reputation in the parliament for his courage and for his preparedness to speak up on any issue, whether popular or unpopular. He was recognised as a man certainly headed to the ministry and possibly to the prime ministership prior to his untimely death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had, as everyone who has read Bert Kelly's books will know, a profound influence on the then young Bert Kelly and on what he saw as Bert Kelly's role if he were to be a responsible South Australian. I was very pleased that the member for Wannon, David Hawker, who I think is a great nephew of Sir Charles Hawker, was able to be present at Bert Kelly's funeral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert entered the parliament, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, in 1958 as the member for Wakefield to succeed the retiring Sir Philip McBride. He came in with a particular view of tariffs and of the Tariff Board&mdash;largely as a result of a lifetime of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exposure to the views of his father, the late Stan Kelly, and, as other members have mentioned, Stan Kelly's involvement on the Commonwealth Tariff Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert had pursued this particular philosophy prior to entering parliament through the columns that he had written initially in farming journals under the title <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dave's Diary</EMPHASIS> and then as a backbencher under the pseudonym the Modest Member, which was to be followed by the pseudonym Modest Farmer when he was no longer in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As others have said, particularly the member for New England (Mr Sinclair), my predecessor had this great capacity to illustrate fundamental truths in a way that people wanted to read and discover more about. He used the characters of his column to bring all of what Bert believed alive and to bring it alive in a way that really meant something to those who were reading it. So all sorts of fundamental truths about tariffs and the impact of tariffs were widely read not only across South Australia and through the farming journals but also through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> and other publications that ran Bert's causes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What had been an unpopular cause, the cause of lowering tariffs around Australia, became increasingly the cause picked up by farmers as they recognised what the real cost of tariff barriers had been. Let no-one underestimate the fortitude and determination needed by Bert Kelly to pursue this course when it was not a popular course and was largely resisted by most in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert served the parliament as the deputy whip, as the chairman of the public works committee, as the Minister for Works and as the Minister for the Navy. It is true that he was defeated by my immediate predecessor, Mr Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles, at a preselection battle in 1977. However, if I might be so bold to suggest, the Prime Minister was just a little wrong when he created the impression that Bert may have lost preselection because of the responsibilities that he had as a minister and the time that he had spent focusing on the tariff battle which, in the Prime Minister's words, meant that he may have neglected his branches.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="53">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone who was living close to the seat of Wakefield at that time, I don't think anyone could ever accuse Bert of having neglected his branches, because he simply loved to be out among the farming community. What happened in 1977 was that there was a redistribution and the seat of Angas, which included the Riverland area, ceased to exist and became amalgamated into the seat of Wakefield. Mr Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles, who had been the member for Angus, chose, not surprisingly, to preselect for the seat of Wakefield. Mr Giles brought with him a number of people who had a particularly protected view of society. I know it well&mdash;and so, by the way, does the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). Having brought those votes with him, he raised the threshold to a point which it was more difficult for the then member for Wakefield, Mr Kelly, to clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was at that preselection&mdash;I remember it well. And I remember, after the result had been announced, Mr Kelly saying that he felt like a slave set free. I think he was very sorry to lose the battle, because there were a number of issues that he felt had still been unresolved. But what he had underestimated was the degree to which the work he had already done had laid the ground rules for the tariff battle to be won.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was in retirement from parliament&mdash;as he pursued his column as the then Modest Farmer&mdash;that he saw the fruition of all that he had sought to achieve during the 19 years that he had spent in the federal parliament and in the years leading up to it. He kept alive his columns; he kept alive his advocacy for free trade and for the lowering of protection. He gained a great deal of self&hyphen;satisfaction, I am pleased to say, out of the result that he saw as the popular economic view turned to advocate that which he had long stood for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say just a couple of things because I believe one of the areas that has been neglected in the tributes so sincerely paid to this former member for Wakefield is that too little has been made of the role of Lorna, his wife, in what was Bert Kelly's success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert married Lorna in 1936. It is said that she was sent to the little Giles Corner School 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> near Tarlee effectively to help her brother, who had just been appointed as the school principal and probably the only member of the school staff. The Kelly farm, so Bert tells us, ran down to Giles Corner and a triangular paddock adjoined the school. Bert would have us all believe that that triangular paddock was worked more thoroughly than any other paddock on the entire farm as he went about courting Lorna during school hours and, of course, after school hours. Whatever the real reason, the facts are that he married Lorna and they raised three sons of whom they are intensely proud&mdash;Tony, Kim and Roger&mdash;and their children and grandchildren are very much a part of the Kelly family. We would do Bert's memory a disservice if we didn't acknowledge the importance to Bert of the family and the importance to Bert of Lorna, who both kept his feet on the ground and kept the objective of tariff reductions clearly in his sights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With great respect, may I say that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) did Lorna something of an unintentional disservice when he mentioned that Mavis may have in some way resembled Lorna. There is no similarity at all between the character Mavis in Bert's column and Lorna, the lady I know as a courageous partner to Bert who, as I said, kept his feet on the ground and kept advancing the cause in which they both so passionately believed. Much of what they did is so well portrayed in the final book that Bert wrote, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Merrindie: A Family's Farm</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is significant, when I talk about Bert as the family man, that all three sons paid a tribute to their father at the funeral service; that they all referred to their father not so much as the man who had been so successful in the advocacy of lower tariffs, but as the man who had been their father and had kept the tradition of family life alive and well. I think it was Kim who read a poem that Lorna had written for Bert on the occasion of his 80th birthday, which touched us all and reminded us of how much she had been involved with his columns, as well as with his object of lowering protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be fair to say&mdash;and I thank the minister, Dr Kemp, for picking this point 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="54"> up&mdash;that Bert wasn't an orator but he was a very effective communicator. He was in demand as a guest speaker across my electorate, certainly up until the last five years when failing health made it more difficult for him to travel. He was in demand not because he was a fluent speaker but because he was a speaker who concisely and effectively got his message across and got it across in a humorous way that everyone remembered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He expected all of us to be aware of what he believed in and, whether we agreed with it or not, to be consistent in our arguments either in support of his line or opposed to his line. It was consistency that was the hallmark of much of  Bert's success. I note that John Hyde, in his tribute to Bert in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, said that one of his first memories of Bert had been of him chastening John Hyde because he had used a particular speech on interest rates to take a rather lackadaisical view of what the government ought to be doing. Bert said to John, `Did you really believe that?' and John said, `No, I didn't.' Bert said, `Then why did you say it?' Because from Bert's point of view, if there was something to be advocated, then one ought to be entirely consistent about it and not be concerned about what the short&hyphen;term gains or failures would be of that particular course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry to be extended about this, but I do want to make a couple of other points. I must pay a tribute to Bert Kelly, not only as the man who stood for free trade and not only as the family man, but as Bert Kelly the farmer. Bert Kelly became a member of the South Australian Soil Conservation Board when it came into being, because he was concerned about the movement of soil and soil erosion on his mid&hyphen;north farm. His father had found in Melbourne, as a member of the Tariff Board, a publication that alluded to ways in which soil conservation could be enhanced by contour banking. He mentioned the booklet to his son, who then went searching for it, found it, and introduced contour banks. He used the agricultural bureau movement in South Australia to spread this form of soil conservation, which has now become the norm. His were the first contour banks and on that farm, Merrindie, many field days were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> held to see what could be done to minimise soil erosion through contour banking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was, as a result of his association with the advisory board and his direct interest in agriculture, a member of the South Australian Advisory Board of Agriculture. He was also selected in 1951 as the first Nuffield scholar to spend six months overseas looking at agricultural practice in the UK. If I may introduce a personal note here, it is something of an amusement to me to report to the parliament that, while Bert was the first Nuffield scholar, my predecessor, Mr Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles, was also a Nuffield scholar, and so was I. So you can imagine I look askance at any of the other Nuffield scholars currently resident in Wakefield.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He successfully served this parliament as the minister for both works and navy. He will, as others have said, be well remembered for his self&hyphen;effacing and self&hyphen;deprecating manner. Wherever Bert went in the electorate he was welcome. Today he is remembered as one of the most colourful and effective members for Wakefield. The great message for us all is that, although his time in parliament was largely spent on the backbench, he so effectively changed a nation's view of what had been a particular philosophy for economics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by picking up the point made by the Leader of the Opposition when he read from the letter that former Prime Minister the Hon. Gough Whitlam had sent to him. It referred to Bert's humour, in that Bert had selected as one of the hymns for his funeral service the hymn entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">They who tread the path of labour</EMPHASIS>. I think I will do the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record justice only if I read the first verse of that hymn. It says, by the way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They who tread the path of labour follow where my feet have trod,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They who work without complaining do the holy will of God.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The funeral service was marked by the sort of humour that only the Kelly boys could introduce when they made available to any who were there copies of the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Merrindie: a family's farm</EMPHASIS> . They said that while that ran counter to father's economic rationalisation, it would be the best tribute any of us could have to his memory. Many people who had 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="55"> not already accessed this book did so. Many of you, like me, were in receipt of Burt's books. He would send you one in the post and say, `Read it and, if you like it, send me $6. If you don't, keep it anyway.' It seemed to be a very effective method of spreading these books and his information and philosophy not only around the electorate but around the nation.</PARA>

I would especially like to commend the current member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) for the very thoughtful, very well researched and very meaningful presentation that he made here in memory of Bert Kelly. I think it was something quite special. I think all of us are greatly inspired and impressed by what he had to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said about Bert Kelly's contribution to the parliament. I would like to briefly go through a few things about the way he did, indeed, take what at the time was a non&hyphen;conventional view for many&mdash;an unpopular view, in many eyes&mdash;and worked on changing the attitude of the decision makers of this nation. I think it was an amazing achievement not only because of the fact that he did so but also because of the perseverance that it took. The changes had to occur over many decades, and yet Bert persevered all the way and never lost sight of what he was trying to achieve. I think in latter years it was probably with quite a lot of satisfaction that he saw what had been achieved. I know from some conversations I had with him that he really felt that many of the things that he had said had finally been vindicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was always highly respected, as others have said. He was always highly regarded. Another great achievement, as has been alluded to, is the fact that he contributed a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> total of 898 columns to various newspapers and other journals during his time. He ran Modest Member, Modest Farmer, Dave's Diary and other articles. It shows that he did have a huge commitment. Those who have read those articles always noted two things, amongst others. First, they were always easy to read and easy to understand. Secondly, they always had a strong message in them. As he said himself, he had to be sure of his facts because he knew there were plenty of others around ready to tear him apart. I think that the fact that the columns continued to be popular for so long and were read by such a wide audience shows that Bert really did have quite a gift in the way he could express himself, particularly in those columns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been mentioned by the current member for Wakefield, I do have a personal association with, firstly, the seat of Wakefield and, secondly, with Bert Kelly, because of the late Charles Hawker. Bert often cited Charles Hawker as being someone who inspired him to undertake not only his role in public life but also to adopt many of the views that he held. I would have to say that I am very proud of that association. One of the things that always encouraged me was the fact that Bert often spoke so highly of the late Charles Hawker and of his achievements during the time when he was in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to say how encouraging I found Bert. I first got to know Bert when I came into parliament. I can remember not long afterwards joining the Liberal Party's federal rural committee, an organisational committee. One of the things that I think was quite unique about that committee&mdash;amongst many others&mdash;is that if you look through the minutes of that period you will see that under `attendance' there are three lines. Members of the committee are listed on the first line and parliamentary observers on the second line. Then there is a third line which just says `Bert Kelly'. It was always like that. That was the regard that Bert was held in. He was a life member, if you like, of the federal rural committee from that time until he was no longer able to  attend. It was assumed that Bert would always be there. He would come as often as he could. He would not try to impose 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="56"> his views but, nonetheless, he was always there to offer some advice. Occasionally he would make sure that the committee kept on the straight and narrow, as he saw it. I think his views were always greatly appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) alluded to the time in 1975 when Bert was speaking on his lonesome in the parliament during the running of the Melbourne Cup, so I will not repeat that story. The member for Barker went on to talk about Bert's role at public meetings and at Outlook conferences. I can well recall going to Outlook conferences&mdash;the local one is on today&mdash;where Bert would be sitting not at the front but right up the back. Those who have been to Outlook conferences will know that the lights are reasonably good at the front, but up the back it is not that easy to see anyone. And yet the chairman would be sitting, looking up there, waiting for the end of the speech, to see Bert. Generally Bert got the first call. Of course, that was an experienced chairman. He would let Bert have his three or four minutes, and then he would say, `Okay, now, Mr Kelly. You had a question, didn't you?' It was always put in such a polite way and it was always taken in such a polite way. I think it shows the sort of standing Bert had that, at those conferences, he was always recognised and always given the chance to put his point of view. It was welcomed there because of the incisive and yet very polite way he could put that point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has lost a very fine man&mdash;someone who made a tremendous contribution to public life over a very long period of time, someone who also set very high standards and very high ideals for himself in the way he cared for his family. As the current member for Wakefield has pointed out, when his family spoke of him at his funeral they showed that the thing that they admired the most was the way he thought of his family first and foremost. I, like others, would like to extend to Lorna, his sons, Tony, Kim and Roger, and their children my deepest sympathy. We have lost a great person, but we have very great memories.</PARA>

It would not be known to many, but Bert is probably a substantial contributing factor to my being in this place. Prior to my election to the federal parliament, I lived in a remote town called Carnarvon where the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  was an almost unheard of publication. I eventually decided that, as a hotel keeper in that town, my education needed to be expanded a little bit beyond that place which many of us did not leave from year to year because it was so difficult to get anywhere else, having no sealed roads for quite a period of the time that I lived there. So I went to the local newsagent and ordered the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> . I think they had to consult their records to find out where you bought that particular paper. It always arrived two or three days late.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, in those days, reading a newspaper was absolute luxury. In fact, I still have twinges of remorse when I sit down of a morning to read the newspaper as part of my duties, because in those days it was a great luxury. I get a feeling of guilt, so I wait till probably Sunday to catch up with half a dozen issues of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. It was there that I discovered the Modest Member who, in later years, became the Modest Farmer. It became a fact of life that, early in the piece, I turned to the Kelly articles first when they appeared because I was so convinced of his logic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that those words had a great effect on my thinking when I came to this place. Bert Kelly not only addressed the tariff issue but also seemed to be able to put down that commentary on the politics of the day in a way, as others have mentioned, that was very easy to read and understand for a backwoods boy like me. The realities were that the views of Eccles, Mavis and Fred were all put succinctly. There was balance within the argument because each had a different point of view. I tended to find myself siding with Eccles and of course what Bert was saying in the background.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="57">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a great time for me when I arrived in the parliament in October 1980. As others have reported, Bert had by then retired due to his lost preselection. I came up very promptly and found myself amongst his disciples. Some people have mentioned that he had some influence over John Hyde. I think it was more a fixation. Hyde, Peter Shack, Jim Carlton and a few of the others were quite clearly Bert Kelly disciples and carried on his message in a very vigorous way after his departure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think, in contrast to John Panizza, we can say of Bert that, having died in his eighties, he had a fortunate life. To last that long and, until the very later years, to enjoy an active and intellectual life, as he always did to the end, I think made Bert himself a fortunate man, particularly because, having had a long life, he actually lived long enough to see the fruits of his endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite remarkable that, notwithstanding the fact that he left the parliament and could no longer contribute directly in that fashion, he carried on. His disciples formed the Modest Members Society, of which I am a proud member. Bert was a regular visitor to some of our functions and kept our interests fired up. Not many of us in the federal scene have had a task of such magnitude to shift public opinion that far and to see the success of our efforts prior to our demise. Bert was very fortunate in all of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In saying those things, I recognise, as I do with John Panizza's family, that the loss of a loved one, such as Bert or John, is always a great shock even when it occurs in later years. We send to the families of John and Bert our sincerest regrets. None of us really like to think that they will ever lose loved ones, but we do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Bert did have a fortunate life. He was a great contributor to Australia. He was an opinion maker and somebody who, in my view, did something that I aspire to&mdash;and that was to tell the king he is not wearing any clothes, and Bert without doubt did that. He explained and proved to Australians, to members of parliament, that there was no substance to the views they held in those days. They were commonly held and they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were probably believed by most. But, of course, the effect that tariffs and other things were supposed to have did not really materialise&mdash;they just taught us to be lazy&mdash;and Bert was the advocate of all that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to close by recording my great support for a great man. The parliament has had others, but Bert's contribution was outstanding in a very significant area. What comes after disciples? There is a lesser row of people. I am afraid I am probably one of them. But I was glad to be amongst the Peter Shacks, the Jim Carltons, the John Hydes and others who so actively carried on. I might add that at the time our present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) might have been in my category&mdash;a bit more of a fellow traveller&mdash;but we were certainly all there arguing those particular issues and recognising the need for change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert was a shining light and he will not be forgotten. I do extend my sympathies to his family. Notwithstanding his long life, people never like to lose their loved ones.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="57" TIME="8.07 p.m." SPEAKER="McArthur, Stewart, MP" NAMEID="VH4" ELECTORATE="Corangamite" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VH4">Mr McARTHUR</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Corangamite)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(8.07 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, in your excellent contribution on the life of Bert Kelly. Bert Kelly, as other members have said, made a magnificent contribution in the field of ideas both to this parliament and to Australia. He was always cheerful and he had great courage at a time when conventional ideas were very much against the arguments that he was putting forward in terms of tariffs and market economies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I came to the parliament I used to have long discussions with Tony Street, the former member for Corangamite, about the ideas of Bert Kelly, his influence on the party room and the way in which he put those simple ideas to convince the prime ministers and the cabinet that maybe their ideas and their policies were incorrect. I well recall the story of Bert Kelly advocating in the party room that under the hen act in South Australia you were a professional hen operator if you had more than 25 hens. So he demonstrated in the party room that when you had 24 hens you were still a private operator and were not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="58"> part of the regulation, but if you had 26 hens you were then part of the South Australian government's regulatory regime and you had to pay all the levies associated with the poultry act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After, in the party room he demonstrated with a piece of wire catching the last hen around the header. In his usual humorous way he had clearly identified the argument that the regulation of the poultry act in South Australia would not work, and there were many farmers in the seat of Wakefield who obviously were not conforming with that particular regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tony Street and I used to argue quite strongly and agree on the merits of those very powerful debates in those years when it was contrary to the wisdom of the day, with Black Jack McEwen advocating the higher and higher tariff barrier and, in my view, selling out country people. It was a lonely existence for Bert Kelly because&mdash;as other speakers have said, and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) demonstrated it quite ably&mdash;Bert Kelly in the party room was generally against the whole conventional wisdom of the Liberal Party, and the National Party in particular at that time, yet he pursued the argument itself and the ideas of lower protection and a more efficient market economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major argument of the farmers and the miners was that they were the producers of real wealth in Australia, yet the tariff redistributed that wealth to the manufacturers, who thought they were being protected from other so-called predators on the international market. That was of course linked in with the centralised wage fixing system, which said that people in the manufacturing sector were entitled to be paid the basic wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As other people have said, the Modest Member articles that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> and other publications around Australia had a major influence in the way in which they were put in such a humorous manner. Some 898 articles I think were produced. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said he read them in the back blocks of Australia and was influenced by the erudite economic wisdom that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those articles portrayed, influencing both country people and I think the bureaucrats in Canberra. The freer trade and the clarity of his views I think are the key features that he leaves with Australia and the parliament. He pursued those arguments because he felt&mdash;and he had researched the points of view and the statistics that gave very conclusive proof&mdash;that tariffs did no good for average Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As other members have mentioned, the Society of Modest Members was formed in 1981 by Jim Carlton, John Hyde and others who wanted to develop the general concept that there should be a freer market economy and that tariffs were not conducive to a better economic Australia. It was on that basis that the Society of Modest Members was formed. It was a group that developed in Canberra and comprised like&hyphen;minded souls within the coalition. It now has like&hyphen;minded souls in every state around Australia and has a very strong membership which debates these matters, even though Bert Kelly is no longer with us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the deputy chairman of that society, I regard it as a great honour to be part of that ongoing legacy of Bert Kelly. The arguments range over issues such as the market economy, privatisation, deregulation and the ongoing tariff debate which is with us here in 1997. Under the diligent and excellent chairmanship of Len Bosman, the member for St George from 1963 to 1969, the society continues to provide an open forum for people who wish to look at the various ideas that might help and shape government policy on both sides of the parliament. So the legacy of Bert Kelly will continue through the Society of Modest Members, where people will openly and honestly debate the issues of the day with an orientation towards a market economy, lower tariffs and an opening up of trade throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a sad day in many ways when a number of us attended the funeral in Adelaide just 10 days ago as a mark of respect to a great life and a great contribution to the debate of ideas both in the parliament and in rural Australia. I acknowledge the fact that former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="59"> present at the funeral. He, by his mere presence there and in the conversation I had with him, also recognised the contribution of Bert Kelly to the debate on both sides of the parliament and I think he&mdash;in reducing the tariff barrier by 25 per cent in one hit, in 1973, I think&mdash;recognised the very inadequate nature of the tariff barrier and the troubles it had caused in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we will all miss Bert Kelly&mdash;his famous case with `CRK' written on the side of it, as the honourable member for Wakefield will recall, his cheerful disposition, the way in which he presented a very compelling case to any meeting he attended and just that cheerful, humorous approach to a number of the arguments that persuaded the academics, the farmers and many of the political writers around Australia of the truthfulness of his proposition. So, on behalf of the Society of Modest Members, I express our deepest sympathy to his wife, Lorna, who had been his lifelong friend, supporter and adviser, and family who were there at that very moving service in Adelaide. Australia and the parliament have lost a very distinguished Australian who in many ways has made a lasting contribution to the changing climate of ideas and policies that have been developed in this parliament and throughout Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight out of respect for Bert Kelly and to recite a few instances where he touched my life, just as he touched thousands and, in an indirect way, millions of Australians. Like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I share common ground with the electorates of Wakefield and Grey where they have varied their boundaries over the years. Therefore, some of the constituents who were Bert Kelly's constituents and your constituents are now my constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my first memories of Bert Kelly&mdash;I did not know him as that at the time&mdash;was when I was a young boy on the farm and my father would get the weekly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stock Journal</EMPHASIS>. Reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stock Journal</EMPHASIS> was pretty serious business, but every week there would be this burst of laughter as my father perused `Dave's Diary', where Bert spun his famous web of words. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps my next memory of Bert was when he was a guest speaker at the Kimba Liberal Party branch. I was charged with the duty of going to Whyalla to pick up Bert. The hour that I travelled over a dirt road with Bert I guess fundamentally changed my life. We called into home on what was a pretty hot day. A cup of water was about all Bert needed to keep him going, and then he went into the meeting. His speaking style always gave messages in a very clear manner. When he got a hostile question from the crowd, he would simply say, `Well, how would you like to be a politician fronting up to all the various issues that politicians face up to?' He was that blunt and said things straight off the chest. You could not help but feel the integrity and the directness of the man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a whole range of experiences of Bert in public meetings and all the rest of it. I will not dwell on them too long because, if he were here, he would talk about me giving tongue too long. But I have a couple of other memories that will stay with me forever. He had a wonderful saying that the trouble with the milk of human kindness is too much of it ends up on the cowshed floor. Bert was always able to bring that mixture of head and heart to the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About three or four years ago, after Bert had left the parliament but I had entered it, I was going around the Wayville showgrounds and there was Bert. I did not think he would recognise me, a mere humble backbencher, but of course he did. He said g'day and asked how it was going. We had just lost the 1993 election, and he asked how this fella was going and that fella was going and about one thing or another. I said in relation to a particular individual who will remain nameless that I did not think he was enjoying it that much after the loss. Bert said to me, as quick as a flash, `You're not supposed to enjoy it, boy. What do you think this is?' That spirit of `you are here to do a job, not have fun' will stay with me, and that job involved tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another part of my life which touched Bert's involved the Northern Territory and his interests in the north. As a young man I worked at Tipperary Station, and Bert paid it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="60"> a visit around that time. In one of his books he mentions the development of the north.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final comment tonight is that Bert leaves us with a fine spirit of bipartisanship on this issue. The fact that Mr Gough Whitlam was at his funeral service and that Labor Prime Minister Mr Chifley visited the farm at Tarlee to be with Bert Kelly's father after the war showed the ability of Bert Kelly and his family to cross over the partisan boundaries in the national interest. In a book by Rattigan there are some fine words about the Tariff Board and about the integrity needed in this economic debate and which Bert Kelly gave Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take part in this condolence motion tonight and to express my sympathy to the family and friends of Bert Kelly. Others, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, have made significant contributions. I would like to speak briefly tonight and think it is appropriate to do so because the sacred sites that were the Kelly family sites were also my own family sites. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) spoke earlier today, he referred to Bert Kelly having being born at Riverton. My father was born at Riverton and so was I. The rolling hills referred to by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) were hills between Tarlee and Riverton, and that was Kelly country and McInerney country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was growing up, Bert Kelly was my local federal member. I recall him speaking at a public meeting at the Riverton Institute. I recall `Dave's Diary' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stock Journal</EMPHASIS>, which the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) has also mentioned, and the stories that my father told. They went to school together and grew up together. They were roughly&mdash;within a year or so&mdash;the same age. They had competed in horse riding events at the Tarlee Show. My father likes to tell the story about how he won one of those despite the fact that Bert thought he had the better horse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert, as others have said, had a wonderful sense of humour and a very genial nature. When I was elected to this place, I recall him, with a real chuckle, referring to `Vin's daughter being in Canberra'. That was the way he then often referred to me. I think about two 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years ago, perhaps slightly more than that, I sat next to him on a plane and he gave me a book about the family farm to take home to Vin. He also told me that he had been invited by the Young Liberals to speak at one of their meetings. I mention that because there would not be all that many people who had been members of this place still being invited by the younger members of their party to speak at meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all have doorknocking stories to tell and stories of campaigns. One my father often jokes about is Bert telling him how he had been doorknocking for Condor Laucke when he was standing against Molly Byrne in a then state election&mdash;before Condor Laucke came to Canberra. Molly Byrne went on to win that election. Having disturbed a shift worker in the day and noting the size and the ferocious way in which the shift worker had answered the door, Bert very quickly said that he was calling on behalf of Molly Byrne and left quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert is a legend in his own district. That is what I think is worth mention. The member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) has also said that Bert's family has every right to feel proud of him. I think that is true. While we, tonight and this afternoon, express our sympathy to his family and friends and to his extended family, his children and grandchildren, I think we also should be celebrating a great life. I think that is the way Bert would like to be remembered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the intention of the opposition to allow the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) through the House of Representatives. But we indicate that we are concerned about the detail that may be contained in what is proposed here and we believe that the implementation of these proposed measures and the way they are to operate will require some closer attention. We know we will not get that attention in this chamber, because we never get a decent response from the government&mdash;in particular, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser). We saw yet again another appalling performance in question time today by the minister in attempting to say what he was going to do for small business. In this debate we will be foreshadowing action in the Senate to address the detail and the intent of this bill and to satisfy ourselves that it will achieve only its stated aim. I do not believe this approach would have been necessary if the processes of consultation that took place were not the sham we believe they were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill deals with changes to the diesel fuel rebate. As many members of this chamber would be aware, the diesel fuel rebate is a very sensitive issue. It is sensitive because of the cost that is involved and the concentration&mdash;and this issue no doubt will be raised by members on the other side of the House; that is, how so few in the mining industry account for the bulk of the spend that is associated with it. But to argue that point misunderstands the size and scale that is necessary in large mining ventures. Underneath all of this it should never be forgotten that what the diesel fuel rebate seeks to do is to correct a distortion in the marketplace brought about by the levying of a fuel excise and the impact it has, as an input to the cost of production, on our primary producing sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a benefit&mdash;a correction if you like&mdash;that  impacts both in the bush and in mining communities. It is something that was constantly trotted up to us in our 13 years in office by Treasury and Finance for abolition. When they failed on every occasion to secure 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="62"> the abolition, there were always attempts to whittle it away. We are now at that again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the House believe that this is but the first wave in terms of the government's approach to trying to dismantle the diesel fuel rebate. We know it was a sensitive issue on the occasion of the preparation of the last budget because it went to the very credibility of the leadership of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) as Leader of the National Party. We know, for example, because the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) admitted it, that the cut in the research and development tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent was the trade&hyphen;off for retaining the diesel fuel rebate. In other words, it was the price of retaining Tim Fischer's leadership as Deputy Prime Minister in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the amount of research and development that it has now been indicated will go offshore because of the cuts to research and development, one would have to argue that it was hardly a clever investment. Nevertheless, it again demonstrates the sensitivity of this issue&mdash;so sensitive that it was something that the Leader of the National Party, as the most senior member of the junior coalition party, was concerned about in that he saw it as a fundamental test of his leadership and his capacity to deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the extent of the sensitivity of this issue is also borne out by the recent indication by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that it will not be up for cuts again in the coming budget. Within 24 hours of identification in the budget honesty document of the Costello crater&mdash;the government's own black hole&mdash;and the indication the Treasurer used to suggest that there would be further significant cuts in the forthcoming budget, the diesel fuel rebate was yet again singled out for particular treatment, to be cut, because Treasury had tried it last time and failed. The Treasurer is, as we know, persistent if nothing else, and it is clearly his intention to try and bring these things back. But it is something that the Prime Minister ruled out within 24 hours of the suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is interesting to look at the statement that the Prime Minister made. He told 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reporters in Ballarat that the scheme had already been examined for savings in the lead&hyphen;up to last year's budget and he ruled out further cuts to the diesel fuel rebate. He reminded reporters at that particular gathering that changes were made and savings are coming from those changes and that, because they had already been subjected to cuts, they would be exempt from cuts in the forthcoming budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting, because in question time today we sought to find out the extent to which this standard would be applied to other measures that clearly are in prospect for cuts in the forthcoming budget. If we take the figure of $440 million that is sought to be saved by this measure, that represents over the four&hyphen;year period something like a 6.9 per cent cut to the expenditure on the diesel fuel rebate. We asked today whether, since 6.9 per cent is a significant cut vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis the diesel fuel rebate and it is therefore exempted from further cuts, the Prime Minister would rule out further cuts to research and development, which copped a 19 per cent cut in the last budget; would he rule out cuts to the labour market programs; would he rule out further cuts to the ABC&mdash;you could go through the list, because all of these areas were the subject of massive cuts in the last budget. But the only thing the Prime Minister so far has indicated a preparedness to rule out is the diesel fuel rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will persist with this line of questioning because, quite frankly, the Prime Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot rule one out and not the others. If in fact the test is that significant savings were achieved on the last occasion, it is a test that has got to be applied consistently, if the Treasurer's statement has any meaning and if the justification used by the Prime Minister in relation to the diesel fuel rebate late last week also has any meaning. Again I mention that point to indicate the sensitivity of this issue and why it deserves scrutiny, why we cannot simply assert that what we are doing here is simply tightening up to ensure that people who shouldn't be entitled to it don't get it. We on the opposition side don't quibble with that notion, but we want to ensure that it is being 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="63"> applied correctly and that it is not a backdoor method to dishonour yet another election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area where this has some sensitivity goes to the minister responsible for administering the Customs Act, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. I notice that he is not in the chamber tonight, and little wonder, because we have pursued him on a number of occasions on the issue of conflict of interest. Remember that the minister for customs and excise is a director of and controls Prosser Automotive Engineers, a company in Western Australia that deals in diesel fuel. Here is the man responsible for administering the act that determines the retention, extension and application of the diesel fuel rebate, and yet he is personally a dealer in diesel fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He argues&mdash;and I accept his word on this point&mdash;that he does not get the diesel fuel rebate himself. That is true, because he is not a user of diesel fuel. But because he supplies diesel fuel to a whole community around the south&hyphen;west corner of Western Australia and beyond, clearly it is of significance to his business in supplying that fuel whether or not the diesel fuel rebate is retained and the extent to which it applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not alleging that Minister Prosser has been a direct beneficiary of the rebate, but rather argue that the indirect benefit he gains at least raises the potential for conflict of interest and that he should have declared that interest when this issue was raised in the cabinet. That is one point at which we argue the minister is against not only normal practice in this place about declaring interests and declaring involvement in the area but also the Prime Minister's code, this new code that the Prime Minister beat his chest about. That was the first statement in this parliament a little under 12 months ago. He came into this place and said, `I'm a different politician. I'm going to raise the standards of parliament. I'm going to insist on a new standard of accountability from my front bench and, therefore, I'm going to produce a code of conduct by which I require them to operate.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those requirements in the code of conduct is that no minister shall retain 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> directorship in a private company. Here is a complete and blatant breach of the code of conduct by the minister concerned because he is still director and holds the controlling interest in Prosser Automotive Engineers. He does not deny that. The code of conduct is explicit&mdash;it says that you cannot retain it&mdash;yet the Prime Minister has refused to require him to divest himself of it. That is the first breach of the code of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second breach, in my view, is the one that I have already alluded to. Here is the appearance of conflict of interest&mdash;a minister that stands to gain indirectly from the extent to which the diesel fuel rebate continues to apply, a minister that has an active interest in understanding who can qualify for it and who can obtain benefit from it because he supplies the product that they are claiming the rebate on. Yet he does not declare that interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contemptuously, we have the minister in this House, time and time again, when we have asked him to explain the conflict and to divest himself of it as the code requires, refusing to do so and the Prime Minister&mdash;leaderless, rudderless, without commitment to his code&mdash;refusing to act upon it. I think it is another demonstration of just how ineffective and weak a leader our Prime Minister is. This is his code. He has made great play of its importance, yet he refuses to act upon it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the code of conduct itself, I would also like to make the point that we exposed the sham that this code of conduct was back in October of last year, not only in relation to the minister for customs but also in relation to the</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone)&mdash;the one who invented the Wright family, the family that did not exist&mdash;and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who was dealing in shares in venture capital when he had responsibility for that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), who continues to make a galah of himself overseas, clearly against the national interest in relation to the DIFF scheme when he said that not one foreign government had raised the concern with him. We were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="64"> able to produce evidence that showed a legion of governments that were doing it. We find a position&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand why you might be, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I am making the point that here we have a minister in breach of the Prime Minister's guidelines and a Prime Minister refusing to act. Again we have seen it, even in the last day or so, with the report that came from Mr Max Moore-Wilton. He was given the task of looking into the affairs of Mr Prosser, the minister for customs, and advising the Prime Minister on what should be done. That report was in the Prime Minister's hands back on 15 November and the Prime Minister did not release it until last night. For almost three months he has been sitting on a report which should have required him to act in a way that addressed the concerns we have raised about Minister Prosser and his particular involvement in administering the act that covers the diesel fuel rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, this report says that it is appropriate for the Prime Minister to set out a code and that it is appropriate for ministers to report to the Prime Minister, but it sets out no requirement by which the Prime Minister is expected to take action. We believe this issue needs to be addressed further. The reason we argue it is that we have a litany of examples, only one of which involves the minister for customs and the administration of the diesel fuel rebate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would, however, appreciate the member for Hotham getting back to the bill before the House, which deals specifically with the mining industry rather than the diesel fuel rebate scheme in total.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Mr Deputy Speaker, I understand that point. But you, coming from a rural community, may be satisfied that this is a bill that applies only to the mining 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry. Part of my argument will be that, to the extent to which changes are made, there is no way there will not be future pressure to apply the changes implemented in relation to the mining industry to the farming sector. That is one of the points that I want to develop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just come to the question, first of all, of the figure that, it is argued, will be saved. I know the minister is not here, but there are advisers for him and I would hope he would address this in his reply. We are advised by public statements that over four years these measures will yield something like $440 million in savings. That is the figure that we have relied upon in terms of the 6.9 per cent cut to the overall scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if you look at the explanatory memorandum to this bill, there are calculations in that that can lead one to the view that the savings could be as high as $640 million. I would ask for clarification as to what the true figure is. I mean, $200 million is not an insignificant amount. In particular, given it is a 50 per cent jump in terms of that which is alluded to by way of savings, I would have thought it was an important issue to clarify.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the concerns of the industry in relation to this bill and why we in the Labor Party believe that further responses are required, why further monitoring is needed and why further ability through Senate processes hopefully will get us to a clearer answer. I note that in the minister's statement, and indeed in his second reading speech, he said that these changes are the consequence of wide&hyphen;ranging consultations with the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of consultations, when the actual changes contained in the legislation were finally announced jointly by Ministers Parer and Prosser on 31 October, much was made of these close consultations. But following the introduction of the bill when the detail became apparent, the Minerals Council of Australia issued a press release expressing disappointment with the legislation as tabled and accusing the government of going beyond their agreement with them. I refer to the media release by the Minerals Council of Australia, which reads:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="65">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation and the comments by the Minister in his Second Reading Speech appear to go beyond that agreement. They do not provide the certainty integral to our agreement. Following a detailed analysis of the legislation, the Council will be seeking the Government's cooperation to rectify the apparent unintended consequences of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was a statement made by Mr Ellis on behalf of the Minerals Council of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the constituency that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, raised by way of a comment from the chair&mdash;the impact on the mining industry alone: concern has also been expressed by the National Farmers Federation. I refer to a report in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of Monday, 4 November. The National Farmers  Federation is quoted as saying that it would be `appalled' if the mining industry's deal was extended to the rural sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and this point is important for you to understand&mdash;is that when this legislation is passed there will be a glaring anomaly between guidelines applying to the mining industry and those applying to the farming industry. We see that excluded from mining operations in this legislation and therefore from the eligibility to claim the rebate will be all vehicles with a gross weight of more than 3&half; tonnes. The concern is that a substantial quantity of diesel is quite legitimately used on farms in such vehicles. I mention four&hyphen;wheel drives, utes, light trucks, self&hyphen;propelled boom sprays, et cetera. What will happen when this legislation is passed is that we will have a glaring anomaly in relation to the use of four&hyphen;wheel drives and utilities. The mining industry cannot claim with respect to them but it is alleged that the farming sector can. That is the agreement. But do you think Treasury is going to leave it there? Do you think Finance is going to leave it there?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Expenditure Review Committee will trot out the argument that says, `Let's abolish the diesel fuel rebate because there are huge savings and we have to get the deficit down.' We will have all that drama again. We will have the Prime Minister riding in on the white horse, saving the day. We will have Tim Fischer going around on his two-minute stops saying that he will fight to the end to retain 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the diesel fuel rebate. But having fought out that little charade, the fall&hyphen;back position for Treasury will be: if we have cut out the exemption, if we have cut out the entitlement, for these sorts of vehicles in mining operations, why should they be retained on farms?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, despite the assurances of the government&mdash;because we all know how many of those were scrapped in the last budget&mdash;the farm sector should not be resting easy. They should not be, because what we have here is an attempt to restrict eligibility for access to the rebate for certain sorts of vehicles in the mining sector and the argument will become one that says: if it applies to the mining sector, if we can get savings out of them&mdash;and they are not insubstantial savings&mdash;why should we not go after the farm sector? Of course what the government will say is: `We have retained the diesel fuel rebate. It is just that we are cutting off a whole range of options as to who can claim it.' In name we will have a diesel fuel rebate; in fact we will have a significant reduction in those seeking to claim it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not just the farm sector that has expressed concern about consultations and the content of this bill, Mr Deputy Speaker; it was also the Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. I quote from a letter from the Acting Executive Director of APPEA, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, of 6 November. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More specifically, APPEA finds it difficult to understand how the Government can claim that the changes have industry support when an industry the size of the petroleum industry is opposed to the proposed modifications.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here we have assertions by the government that they have consulted industry on matters affecting them contained in this legislation. But we have got doubts raised by the farmers as to whether there will be an attempt to encroach on them in the future. We have got the petroleum and production exploration industry saying that the legislation does not reflect any agreement that was had with them. And we have got the Minerals Council of Australia saying that the legislation goes far beyond anything that they had agreed to.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="66">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for that reason that we will support in the Senate the mechanisms that hopefully will ensure that these industries have the opportunity to put their argument through the Senate inquiry process. We know that the government will take the view that, because it has the overwhelming weight of numbers in this place, it does not really have to listen to us. We can get up and make the speeches but, in the end, they have got the numbers to roll it through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a different circumstance in the Senate, and parliament should be about scrutiny. It should not be about frustration; it should be about scrutiny. And it should be about holding governments accountable for that which they promised&mdash;promised before the election and promised in consultation subsequently. It should be about ensuring that accountability is delivered. If we cannot get that accountability in this chamber, we will use our position in the other House to achieve that very result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the final analysis, we do not have a problem in principle with the view that, if tightening up is needed, if it is about ensuring that entitlements that should not otherwise be there are obtained because of flaws in the legislation, if it is about use of Administrative Appeals Tribunal procedures that seek to extend the thrust and the intent of the act beyond that which was intended, then by all means legislate to address those issues. But don't pretend that you have got agreement when you haven't and don't pretend that you are retaining the diesel fuel rebate when you are finding a backdoor method to emasculate it. And don't pretend that you have delivered on your promise to retain the diesel fuel rebate when in fact you have got sections of industry blatantly saying that you have not delivered on an agreement with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that, as a government, your standing with industry is at an appalling level. They say that you lack vision; they say that you lack industry policy. And it is not just the industry sector that says it; it is the Premier of Victoria that joins them. The fact of the matter is that this government has not got an industry policy because it does not see a role for government in terms of developing an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry policy. It believes that what you should do is let everyone survive in the marketplace and let the marketplace rip, regardless of the consequences and regardless of the fact that we do not have level playing fields around the place. That is not a matter for government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the Labor Party take a different view. We say that there has got to be a role for government. We say that, where there are market failures, we should seek to address them. We say that, where the level playing field is tilted against us, we should seek to address that issue. That is why we have been prepared to work in partnership with government to achieve a commitment to invest in this nation in clever activity, in innovative activity, in developing our natural resource base. Unless we back the mining industry and the farming sector in this country we can kiss goodbye value&hyphen;added activity; and that is where our future does lie despite what the minister for primary industries has to say about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that this is a vital measure of importance to the industry. It is something that cannot be glossed over as an administrative tightening and it is certainly something that cannot be swept under the carpet, the government saying it has got the agreement from industry when it clearly has not.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I must say that I am a little disappointed, due to no fault of your own, that I have not been given the opportunity to follow a government member in this debate. I would have been particularly keen to hear how government backbenchers are responding to the bill that is currently before the House. However, I have to say that during my first speech in this place I made reference to the significance of the mining and agriculture sectors in my electorate. Indeed, I suggested that my electorate forms the engine room of New South Wales, supplying most of the coal that powers its power stations, the lion's share of its export coal and, of course, a great deal of its agricultural product. I think members will understand why I would take the opportunity to speak to any bill which has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="67"> as its subject matter the diesel fuel rebate scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the bill seeks to enact changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme in order to restrict eligibility in the mining operations category to close loopholes and also to address recent Federal Court and AAT decisions that have had the effect of widening the definition of mining operations as it relates to the diesel fuel rebate scheme and to improve the accountability of the scheme and reduce the expenditure under the scheme from misuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that by now members on both sides of this House recognise and accept that the rebate is not a subsidy but indeed is a legitimate recognition that those who enjoy the benefits of the scheme do operate off&hyphen;road and its retention is absolutely essential. Of course, it ensures that the mining and rural sectors are not hit or whacked with tax on their business imports. It is worth almost $800 million to the mining industry and almost that much again to the agricultural sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is a well&hyphen;known fact that, in the lead&hyphen;up to its first budget last year during its budget deliberations, the now government did consider the total abolition of the scheme. But thankfully, due to community and industry pressure and, I am proud to say, pressure from those who sit on this side of the House, the government was forced into a backdown on that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I laugh when I think back to the weeks&mdash;indeed, the months&mdash;immediately after the budget when the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) were roaming the country espousing the good news to all and sundry that they were lucky, that they had been given a gift and that the government had decided not to abolish the scheme. I would suggest that that was a rather curious announcement which did nothing more than inform those who enjoy the benefits of the scheme that they would continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to demonstrate the government's duplicity&mdash;its hypocrisy&mdash;on this issue. I want to share with the House a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> extract which I came across today. I want to conceal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the speaker's name until I have read the extract to the House. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On budget night, the government proudly and loudly declared that it would leave the diesel fuel rebate scheme intact. After the controversy and the public debate leading up to budget night, with industry fearing that the diesel fuel rebate scheme would be curtailed or even abolished, the government's announcement was met with a great deal of relief and was endorsed by industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, we now find that several substantial changes have been proposed by the government to determine eligibility for claiming rebates under the diesel fuel rebate scheme.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is not someone on this side of the House speaking in response to the 1996-97 budget; this is the now Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) speaking to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. The bill was an attempt to address the weaknesses in the system that have been highlighted by so many reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill of that day sought to save the government some $55 million per year. The bill before the House tonight, as the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has pointed out, talks about savings of around $140 million per year. So the Minister for Science and Technology came into this place to speak to a bill not all that dissimilar to the one before us tonight and to complain about how the government of the day, having announced the retention of the scheme, was somehow coming in the back door and reducing the benefits of the scheme to the industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is hypocrisy and it is certainly worthy of note. I have to say that the scheme is a mess. I would be happy to support and be part of any bipartisan process to approach its repair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The link between the fuel excise and road funding long ago disappeared. The cost of the scheme continues to blow out and now stands at nearly $1.5 billion. Rorting in the system does occur&mdash;we all accept that. But since the introduction of the diesel excise in 1957, the policy decisions relating to the protection of miners, forresters, those in the agricultural sector and those who provide essential services have been very poorly developed&mdash;I recognise that it has been very poorly devel 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="68"> oped on both sides of politics&mdash;and have, in the main, been knee-jerk political reactions to fiscal challenges of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, too, is the list of reviews into the system indicative of the mess we have ended up with with the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Those reviews include the report of the Auditor-General of September 1984, the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts report No. 224 of October 1984, the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts report No. 234 of September 1985, the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts report No. 241 of September 1985, the report by the Industries Assistance Commission in November 1986, the report of the Australian Customs Service of March 1987, the Auditor-General's audit report No. 27 of 1990-91 and most recently the Auditor-General's audit report No. 20 of 1995-96. So there has been a great list of reports or inquires into the scheme. Many of the recommendations coming from those reviews are yet to be developed and adopted by either side of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1991 audit highlighted many weaknesses, most of which were highlighted in earlier reviews. They include: the lack of clarity in the scheme's objectives, a complex and ill&hyphen;defined eligibility criterion&mdash;something that has been made only more complex, I think, by the bill before us tonight&mdash;a self-assessment system that is open to rorts, overpayments in the system, the efficiency of the delivery of the scheme and the expansion of the eligibility criteria affected by Administrative Appeals Tribunal decisions and decisions of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do accept that the bill before the House is an attempt to address some of the weaknesses of the diesel fuel rebate scheme, but I must express my concerns&mdash;and join with the member for Hotham&mdash;in a number of areas, including the apparent decision by the government to renege on the arrangements it had with the mining industry. I want to reinforce the media release that the member for Hotham made reference to. The Minerals Council of Australia on 13 December 1996 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Jerry Ellis, President of the Minerals Council of Australia, expressed disappointment with the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Government's Customs and Excise Legislation tabled in the House of Representatives late yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The minerals industry was committed to our agreement to work with the Government to develop and implement changes to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme (DFRS). The intent of agreed changes was to achieve the dual objectives of facilitating an expanding, competitive minerals sector while containing expenditure growth flowing from widening eligibility beyond the intent of the Scheme", Mr Ellis said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The legislation and the comments by the Minister in his Second Reading Speech appear to go beyond that agreement. They do not provide the certainty integral to our agreement. Following a detailed analysis of the legislation, the Council will be seeking the Government's cooperation to rectify the apparent unintended consequences of this legislation", Mr Ellis said.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Hotham has also referred to concerns expressed by the National Farmers Federation: the anomalies that would exist under the act as a result of the passage of this legislation and future flow-on effects to the agricultural sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fear that the bill is more about fiscal tightening rather than a genuine attempt to improve the scheme's integrity and to help ensure its long-term viability and its long-term future. I think the main message in the course of the second reading debate on this bill is that those on this side of the House will continue to fiercely oppose any further or future attempts to either erode the value of the scheme to the industry or to abolish the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, I think we should all accept now that it is a legitimate recompense of a tax on business imports. I hope the government recognises that and I hope, having heard some more speculation in recent days about the future of the scheme, that the government recognises its importance and is committed to its retention, because those of us on this side certainly are.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very keen to participate in this debate, albeit briefly, because people listening to the debate either in the gallery or over the radio must truly wonder where the opposition is coming from. If ever there were a classic case of the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="69"> wanting to have a bob&mdash;or maybe it is a dollar&mdash;on the diesel fuel rebate either way, this was the debate where we witnessed it. He remarked that this scheme is a mess. He remarked that he was happy to support amendments to improve the delivery of the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation we are dealing with tonight is legislation that amends the scheme to improve its delivery and to minimise the number of potential rorts that may occur. Not only is the legislation being supported by the opposition, but the member for Hunter might have been a little less churlish in his endorsement of it. His endorsement, however, was much more fulsome than that of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham chose this debate to run a whole lot of red herrings that had nothing to do with the legislation before the House. The member for Hotham said, `We've had the Prime Minister stand up and reassure the mining industry and reassure the agricultural industry that there will not be further changes to the scheme in this budget.' Then the member for Hotham went on about a matter that I thought was totally unrelated and said, `I'm going to pursue the Prime Minister and pursue the Treasurer and seek the same sort of reassurance about the labour market, about the ABC and about every other area of government expenditure to see that it too will be quarantined from any changes in the coming budget.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of all people in the opposition, the member for Hotham knows that no government runs into a budget quarantining various areas from expenditure cuts. If it does, there is no end to the list. The diesel fuel rebate scheme is such a sensitive area. It is an area that running into the last budget&mdash;as the member for Hunter was generous enough to acknowledge&mdash;caused the government some angst. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been keen to indicate that this is an area where farmers and miners have nothing to fear. I was very pleased to hear him say that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, what the member for Hunter alleged&mdash;and I think it was quite unfounded, although we will both speculate about that, I am free to concede&mdash;was that, running into 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the last budget, this scheme was at risk. Let me tell the member for Hunter that, as a member of the government, I was never aware of the scheme being at risk. I was aware of the rumours that were run&mdash;and very conveniently fuelled by the opposition to their advantage&mdash;to suggest that the scheme was at risk. But, had the scheme been at risk, the member for Hunter might care to identify the number of people not only in rural Liberal seats, of which there is a multiple number, but also in National Party seats who would not have tolerated any such change, as he well knows. So prior to the announcement of the budget there was a reassurance that this was nothing more than nonsense, and precisely the same reassurance has preceded this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What foundation is there then for the sorts of allegations that were made by the member for Hunter? Even more significantly, what foundation is there for the outrageous suggestions made by the member for Hotham that impinge directly on the character of the minister? If the member for Hotham had any evidence, he should have stood in this parliament and proposed a substantive motion critical of the minister. But no, let us just use this piece of legislation by innuendo to suggest that in some way the minister has failed in his duty and failed in his obligation before the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the reality? The reality is that the legislation before the House deals with the mining industry only. The reality is that, whatever fuel excise does for any business run by the minister, precisely the same arrangements are available for any one of the minister's competitors. There is&mdash;as anyone objectively listening to this debate will know&mdash;no advantage in this legislation to the minister, and it is grossly irresponsible and an abuse of the House for the member for Hotham to suggest otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme before the House proposes that potential rorts of the scheme in the mining industry should be focused more sharply by ensuring that any vehicle that weighs less than 3&half; tonnes is not, in fact, able to be filled with diesel in the mining industry. It is a change I welcome, and it is a change I welcome because, as the opposition have cor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="70"> rectly identified, this scheme is always under the searching spotlight of Treasury. I want to ensure that I can eyeball any Treasury official and say, `This scheme is being run with all the integrity possible.' What we are proposing tonight adds to that integrity. Do farmers have something to fear in a flow-on sense? I would not have thought so. The use of a vehicle of less than 3&half; tonnes on a farm is very different to its use within the mining industry.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very grateful for those interjections that help the debate so much. The simple fact is that the use of vehicles of less than 3&half; tonnes in the mining industry is much more likely to be for the transportation of personnel to and from work and for a range of activities not directly related to mining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I represent large rural holdings and small rural holdings. There are very few vehicles of under 3&half; tonnes on rural holdings not being used simply on the farm for the immediate purpose of farm maintenance, whether it is for checking stock water, monitoring stock, moving tools or whatever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, as I and every other representative of a rural seat knows, the present administration of the act, as it affects farmers, already forces them to ensure that all on&hyphen;road use of diesel is accounted for. I have had instances, as I am sure all members opposite have had, of farmers coming to me saying, `Look, we have been obliged by the excise administrators to account for our diesel expenditure and to account for our on&hyphen;road and off&hyphen;road use and the proportion.' I have had, as honourable members would know&mdash;and I am sure it is no less true for the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe)&mdash;instances of farmers having to then quantify the fuel use of the truck to ensure that the amount of fuel totally consumed on the farm was rightly apportioned for on&hyphen; and off&hyphen;road use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all fairness, I should not be entertaining any of this because it is unrelated to the immediate legislation, which is about the mining industry. I merely felt obliged to pick 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up the interjection from the member for Burke and point out that I was not debating this in some form of ignorance. The reality is that the allegation by the member for Hotham that the minister had some sort of vested interest in this was totally unrelated to this legislation. That is something that the minister, I know, will want to deny utterly. It is an allegation that I could not allow to sit in the chamber, having recognised that it is totally unfounded, particularly as this legislation deals with the mining industry and not with any other industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pick up another point rightly made by the member for Hunter. I will endorse his comments wholeheartedly on this. The diesel fuel rebate scheme, whether it is in the mining industry or in rural industry, is frequently misunderstood because it is all too easily seen as some sort of gift to those who are the beneficiaries of the scheme. The reality, put by the member for Hunter and endorsed by me, is that this is not a case of the government giving something to those who are the beneficiaries of this scheme. Instead, it is a case of the government recognising the difference between primary industry and secondary industry and saying, `This tax which we the government levy on a number of industries and levy on all on&hyphen;road users, no matter whether they are in primary or secondary industry, is not appropriate to be applied to primary industries.' That is the point made by the member for Hunter and he is absolutely right. This is not a case of revenue being handed out. This is a case of tax being deliberately forgone in recognition of the primary role of those industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would remind the House that that sort of approach to primary industry and to export income generating industries has always highlighted the tax attitude of the present government. It is true that a proposal that we had in 1993 is not now being considered, but this reinforces our long&hyphen;term attitude to tax on export industries&mdash;that we do not believe it is appropriate to burden them with the tax. In that context we have maintained the policy of the previous government, a policy which we had when we were last in government, which says that this inappropriate application of a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="71"> tax should have a refund mechanism. That is what the diesel fuel rebate scheme is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only this week I received from an organisation called NatRoad an appeal on behalf of road transport operators to have the diesel fuel rebate scheme changed so that only what they referred to as the `road user charge' should, in fact, be rebatable. They had calculated the road user charge at 18c per litre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They, too, misunderstood the nature of the scheme. The nature of the scheme is not a technique for effectively handing money back to anybody but to avoid the government collecting tax from an industry or an industry sector that should not have to pay it. We have agreed that that sort of requirement should apply in the mining industry. That is what this legislation is about. We have also recognised, as has the member for Hunter, that within the mining industry there has been the potential for rorting that is now being addressed in this legislation. Because the legislation does nothing but reinforce the integrity of the scheme, it deserves the unqualified support of both sides of the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The timing of this is all quite exquisite. After spending nine months talking about Labor's black hole, the opposition folk suddenly find they have got what we are choosing to call the Costello crater. I might say that, when you have got a novice in the chair, as you will come to understand, Treasury never gives up. I remember not very long ago, when this legislation was introduced and discussed in its first form, that there were announcements between the government and the mining industry and much was made of the consultations that had taken place and of the agreement that had been reached that this legislation was going to be simply tightening up loopholes within the industry. But of course what we find, now that the amendments have come back, is that it has gone considerably further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that there have been discussions between representatives of the mining industry, the government and Customs officers about the effects of some of these redefinitions, and they are hopeful that they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are being listened to. I would not hold out too much hope that they are being listened to because I think what is being flushed out here is a deeper agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government announced the tightening up of the diesel fuel rebate scheme, it costed the savings to budget at $441 million over four years. But the explanatory memorandum now proposes a financial impact of $60 million per annum&mdash;that is, $240 million over four years&mdash;and, in addition, it refers to an extra $100 million saving of additional outlays relating to the AAT and Federal Court decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If all this is added in, the saving is $640 million over four years. That is considerably greater than the assurances given to the industry last year. If those figures are correct&mdash;they come from the government's own estimates&mdash;then I wonder whether the government have any idea at all what the savings really are. If they do, then they have slipped this through the very people who have been quite close to them. This is a case of good friends being ratted on. They are taking it pretty hard, too, I might say. They have not only slipped it through but also added another 30 million bucks worth via some redefinitions in these new proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said that I think there is a deeper motive at work here. In January, during what they call the silly season&mdash;maybe it was a silly statement&mdash;the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) let out a press comment which gave us some focus on the direction of this government towards the priorities in commodities and primary industry. His comments were that Australia should focus more on improving its exports of raw materials than on developing processing industries. For that, read `downstream processing, value adding, extra jobs'. Minister Anderson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is likely that improving the quality of our raw materials will become much more important than value adding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Where, in this little piece of legislation, is the extra bit of revenue being dug out? It is in the changes to a process, which they have dreamed up, called `beneficiation'. Put in layman's terms, it is where you use diesel 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="72"> fuel as part of the heating and energy process in doing a bit of downstream processing somewhere between the end of the line and the start of the line where the raw material has been extracted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some examples in the mining process which are closer to the mined and extracted end than the final marketable commodity, such as a slab of processed steel, for instance, are processes such as roasting, sintering, smelting, calcining and leaching. It applies right across the mineral sands, gold and coal industries. They have these integrated processes that are part of taking the raw extracted product&mdash;you understand this well, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, because of the work that takes place in your electorate&mdash;and preparing it for the phase of refining and downstream processing. Admittedly, it is further than the stage where you dig it up, stick it in a boat and sell it as a raw product. It actually involves the part of the process that starts to create a few extra jobs. I go back to the minister's comment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is likely that improving the quality of our raw materials will become much more important than value adding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What on earth is wrong with these people? We have just been through the traumas, as a nation, of transposing ourselves from being `chop it down, dig it up, send it off in ships' people to actually trying to add a bit of value in the nation. Now they are turning back. More importantly, this legislation exactly reflects that trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are committed to not opposing the legislation as it goes through this House because that is the undertaking we have given, I am making it very clear to the parliamentary secretary and the minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser)&mdash;I hope he will pass these views on to the minister&mdash;that if ratting on the agreements you made last October with the mining industry is unintended, then you have the opportunity in the phase in the other house to take account of the amendments that have been proposed to you and that are under discussion at the moment by representatives of the mining industry. This is where they will find out whether they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have been ratted on or whether it is an unintended consequence that can be finetuned. My view of it is that they should not hold out their hopes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am making it very clear that, although we on this side of the House will not be voting against the legislation in this phase, we will be indicating in the other place that we expect these amendments to be picked up. It is not solely around the points I have already made. There are some other signals now coming in about investment trends in the Australian economy that roll, in part, off these sorts of issues. Nobody in either agriculture or farming expected that the diesel fuel rebate would turn up on the budget table again. They had been through many years of seeing it examined. Successive Labor governments had maintained the diesel fuel rebate, in the face of considerable pressure from Treasury, as an obvious cost saving measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When many in these industries supported the coalition at the last election, the last thing they expected was that their diesel fuel rebate would turn up on the table. They made their way through it, but they did not expect it to turn around and bite them again they way it is now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) touched on the issue of farmers not needing to have any concern. For heaven's sake, the miners were told last October: `This is as far as we intend to go.' Now, by January, which is just a quiet three months later, we have already slipped another $30 million worth in, including the vehicles under 3.5 tonnes. Farmers of course can do little else but stare at the media about the Costello crater. They know that there are going to be more budget cuts from this government because they got it so wrong and, no matter what assurances they get, they are going to have to seriously expect that the case for 3.5&hyphen;tonne or less vehicles out on remote mine sites is absolutely no different from the use of vehicles in that weight category, whether they are spraying equipment or four&hyphen;wheel&hyphen;drives driving around the farm, when it comes to farming or mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think those members, particularly of the National Party, who are sometimes described 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="73"> as Liberals in sheep's clothing will be much better defined as sheep in Liberal clothing by the time this particular issue sees its way through. Those people would want to be looking very closely after the interests of their constituents, because this is very much on the table. There is no way it could not be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other aspect of this that I want to touch upon. Some figures released yesterday from the Bureau of Statistics show that the mining and exploration industry has increased its investment in offshore exploration&mdash;I do not mean off the Australian coast; I mean exploration in other countries vis-a-vis exploration in Australia&mdash;by 13 per cent in the last 12 months. When you ask the industry why they have taken that investment offshore, they tell you that a number of factors taking place in Australia are causing them to be less certain than they were when they were investing their heads off in exploration and development under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those comments that they make, and one of the key factors they give, is the now intense confusion, uncertainty and distrust over the diesel fuel rebate because many of these companies are actually now anticipating a substantial increase in energy costs. As those familiar with these industries know, energy costs, particularly if diesel fuel is your only form of energy, are significant in the make or break of the exploration or what it might lead to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, which runs around boasting about low inflation and low interest rates&mdash;in a country that ought to be comfortable and ready to invest its head off&mdash;wants to have a good hard look at what it has created in just 12 months in this industry: a 13 per cent increase or drift offshore to other countries of investment capital in this industry for these reasons, and the government knows it. The industry has told it, but it does not have any answers for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government are sitting there with this Treasury driven budget process. We have been through it; we know what it is all about. We know how relentless it is. As I said, when you have a novice, he is easy bait. That is what has happened here. You have an industry that has been a very strong supporter of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the coalition government now in deep despair about the fact that it is being turned on and in such an untrustful way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make those few points to make it clear to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), who are at the table, that we will be not opposing the passing of this legislation. But, as has already been pointed out by my colleagues the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), we have severe reservations about what has developed in these three months since the original announcements in October. We expect in particular that the proposals being requested by the industry will be considered in the Senate phase. We will be reconsidering our position in the Senate phase if that does not come to pass.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak on this customs and excise bill but, sitting in my office listening to the self-justification and hyperbole on both sides, I felt compelled to. The truth is that, in Australia today, we have a one-party system. We have branches that will not part on each side of this chamber and there is really nothing to choose between them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to go briefly to the recent history of the diesel fuel rebate. It is absolutely clear that, once Senator Walsh left the Finance portfolio, the so-called Treasury boffins had it very much their own way. There was no doubt that they were giving advice to the Labor government to impose a diesel fuel rebate. It was certainly on the cards. It was justified by all sorts of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the great credit for it not occurring does not belong in this House; it belongs to the state member for the seat of Eyre, Julian Grill, who lobbied Beazley very hard on this issue and pointed out to Beazley that one of the great losers would be his own electorate for which he was unlikely to be forgiven.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the advent of the new government, Treasury were back again with the same sort of advice. I want to give you a little insight into the ability of these gentlemen from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="74"> Treasury. I go back to the gold tax days, back to 1986, when there was a strong move to bring in a gold tax. I argued against it very strongly. I remember having a meeting with Hawke and Keating. I said, `If you leave gold alone, it will go through a billion dollars.' In those days I think it was something like $300 million a year. `What rubbish,' said Keating. He said, `I talked to the mining industry,' by which he meant Western Mining. He said, `My experts in Treasury tell me it will peak at $800 million.' It went to $4 billion. I was wrong at a billion dollars, but I was a damn sight closer than Treasury. That is the intellect you are dealing with here. If they see a ready source of income, they will grab it no matter what the consequence is. Contrary to the argument by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), this is not tax forgone; it is simply tax that should never be imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax on diesel was originally supposed to be for funding infrastructure. The mining companies and the farmers do not use that infrastructure; they create their own. They therefore should not be paying for it. The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) said that this is still on the agenda. Actually I do not think it is. The government would not be game to do it again because the mining companies showed how angry they were. Farmers are powerless. There are so few of them. They have no lobbying power. They have become political eunuchs. But the mining industry would not cop it. They have been dudded, because in my estimation it is another $100 million they have been hit for, not $30 million. The government is clamping down in all sorts of ways. There is the absurdity that there is no diesel rebate for mine water pumped off a mine site. You cannot legislate for where the water occurs, you actually have to get it where it is, and in some cases it is off the mine site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that there was very little rorting in the mining industry; there really was not any scope for it. There was rorting in primary industry, and I do not blame them. Given the pressure on primary industry today, very few of them could exist without fudging at the edges things like the diesel fuel rebate. But there was very little abuse of the system in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the mining industry. The miners today, even with the diesel fuel rebate, are paying more for diesel than any of our competitors. That ought to be made clear. The government, at the behest of these wizards from Treasury, wants to make this industry, which is so important to Australia, more difficult; yet the industry is already paying more for diesel than all our competitors. That is an inescapable fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that this was an ill&hyphen;conceived grab for more money. There is no doubt that it would have succeeded had the mining industry not realised the dire danger it was in. There are many small gold mines operating today whose margins are less than the diesel fuel rebate. The rational economist would tell us, `Let them close down. Let them depart the scene.' They are doing a great job for Australia. It is good for the country that they are employing people and tax is being paid on their income. But they are working on very fine margins because gold is at a very low price in Australia today, and it is a great tribute to the industry that we have become so efficient in the mining of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ought to have a look at what is really happening. If these people who advise governments thought about it, they could do the country some good. There is no reason in most cases why the mining industry cannot use light crude oil for a lot of its energy sources. Certainly in powerhouses it is a sensible option. It is much cheaper. What is happening now is that we are pumping out the light crude, we are exporting it to Singapore and then reimporting the refined diesel. I am sure there is an absolute net loss to us in that transaction. Also, we are importing a lot of high&hyphen;speed diesel engines. Because of the high wear on them, we give them a tax write&hyphen;off over five years whereas the big, slow revving engines that use light fuel oil get a tax write&hyphen;off over 25 years. So the country gets another whammy while we keep importing these high&hyphen;speed diesel engines mainly from America but some from Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining industry should be given a lot of encouragement to shift, where it can, to light fuel oil with absolute guarantees that we are not going to tax that. What have we done 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="75"> in that regard? The Apache oil company Stag No. 1 well is pumping light crude oil out of the ground. It is quite suitable to be used in powerhouses just as it is&mdash;it needs no refining&mdash;but the government will not give it a tax exemption because it is not polluting enough. It does not have enough contained carbon. It does not give off enough black smoke. It burns too clean. What a lot of nonsense&mdash;these genii who think they have a way to pay government expenses by taxing the very industries that make this country viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we said to farmers, to local governments around the country and to state governments generating power, `We recommend and we urge you to use this fuel oil so that we can save the cost of importing fuel oil and importing high&hyphen;speed engines,' this country would be a long way in front. But no-one there has the nous to understand it. The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), who is at the table, has written me many letters which indicate that he never had a clue what it was about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Burke mentioned that mining companies were going offshore. There is absolutely no doubt about this: they are going offshore. But it is not because of the diesel fuel rebate. They know that if there is any more tampering of this they will fight and they will win, because they can certainly bring to bear the sort of firepower that no government can resist. What is driving companies offshore is sovereign risk, and that ought to be clearly understood. Sovereign risk is the great thing that is making our mining companies look offshore, and I think the Labor Party ought to give this some serious consideration in the native title debate which this House is going to have. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak in this debate. For the time being I think they are all the points I wanted to raise.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In concluding the debate on the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, I thank the members who made contributions. However, I think some issues need to be set straight. The government's approach to this scheme was to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> try to contain the expotential growth of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. In the 1996-97 budgetary year, the outlays of the scheme for the mining category were in the order of $793.7 million. Why the scheme had grown beyond its original intent was in some part due to successful claims to the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The legislation seeks to contain that growth and to correct that movement of the scheme into areas it was not previously intended for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) made a number of statements and the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), I note, said that in October the mining industry was basically told&mdash;I think these were his words&mdash;one thing and then by January we had slipped in the 3.5 tonne vehicles. I want to correct that incorrect assertion. In a memo dated 9 October 1996 the Minerals Council confirms for their members a schedule which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, we seek your agreement to the following package for the resolution of outstanding issues relating to DFRS:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They put up 12 items. Four of the items mentioned were already not eligible for rebate, but item 11 of the proposition put to the government reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">all vehicles under 3.5 tonne GVW suitable/capable for use on public roads whether registered or not;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So there is no question that we changed in any way the rules to the agreement we arrived at with that working group of the Minerals Council. Reference was made to concerns by APPEA. I point out that Mr Wells was then the CEO of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, so he too was very involved in the negotiations the government had with regard to those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) made reference to light crude oil. I point out to the member for Kalgoorlie that light crude is now in fact subject to excise at the same rate as diesel&mdash;that at present being 34.5c per litre. That amendment was introduced by the previous government and probably at a time when he was a member of that governing party. So whether, in the case he was making, power stations use diesel or light crude for their power generation, in that instance they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="76"> are not eligible for rebate and both products are excisable at the same rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the tightening of the scheme, members may be aware that the Auditor-General, in a review of the administration of the scheme, made several references and recommendations with regard to the accountability of that scheme. That audit report, as I recall, was Audit Report No. 20. It made reference to overclaiming and the need for tighter compliance with and administration of the scheme. The bill picks up that tighter compliance and better administration and better accountability referred to by the Auditor-General's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I note the comments of the member for Burke. I can advise the member for Burke that the government has been having discussions with the minerals industry and that to overcome some matters the government may well amend the legislation in the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor opposition does not oppose the passage of the Telecommunications (Numbering Fees) Amendment Bill 1996 or the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1996. These two bills are fundamentally linked to the large package of legislation concerning the regulation of the telecommunications industry post-July 1997. The policy principles on which this package of legislation was based were drafted by the former minister, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The post-July 1997 legislation is currently the subject of a public inquiry being conducted by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee. Public hearings of the committee commenced on 29 January and continue on 7 and 14 February. The committee is due to report to the Senate on 25 February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Senate did not formally refer these two bills to the telecommunications bills inquiry, the bills have been the subject of extensive debate by witnesses appearing before the Senate committee and by members of that committee. This is the situation in the Senate. I am not always so fulsome in my recognition of events in the other place, but both the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and the shadow minister for communications dealing with this matter are senators. I understand they have had some discussion as to whether these bills should be before the House tonight, because they have obviously been trying to progress some of these matters with the witnesses and the evidence that has been placed before the Senate committee&mdash;of which Senator Schacht is a member.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="78">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the obvious interrelationship between the post-July 1997 legislation and these two bills, no members of the Senate committee, which is chaired by Senator Short, objected to the issues contained within the bills being discussed at length. What I am foreshadowing essentially is that any items the Labor Party might want to move by way of amendment will flow through the Senate process following the deliberations and report of that Senate committee. Those matters will be addressed by the shadow minister for communications, Senator Schacht.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Labor opposition supports in principle the two bills currently before the House, members of the Senate committee have expressed concern that, given such considerable debate of the bills before their committee by key industry participants and consumer representatives and given the fact that witnesses have raised a number of seemingly valid points in relation to the bills, consideration should await that particular Senate committee report. Accordingly, it is our strong belief that the final passage of these bills should not proceed in the Senate, and if need be by way of consideration of Senate amendments, in this House until that process is complete. A further reason for delaying final passage of the bills is that the Senate committee is still waiting for answers to questions on notice on these two bills&mdash;including information from the Department of Communications and the Arts. This information may be relevant to the final wording of the bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally, it needs to be recognised that, in this period of telecommunications competition, some telephone numbers are commercially valuable. It is no secret that for most businesses the requirement of a recognisable, easy to remember telephone number has commercial value. In that sense, the numbers should be regarded as a community resource. It is quite proper, the Labor Party believes, for the government to levy fees, charges, taxes, whatever is necessary, to place a premium on that particular community resource.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe for a single minute that any of those principles should apply to nor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mal residential telephone numbers. They should not be covered by any user fee or any attempt by government to raise revenue. It has been an Australian tradition, I understand, from the good old days when Telstra was the public monopoly and had all the numbers, that they were provided free of charge. We recognise the community resource, the commercial importance of some telephone numbers&mdash;the ones that are easy to recognise and easy to remember&mdash;and government has a legitimate revenue raising function in that area, but it should not be expanded to cover any of the allocations of telephone numbers for residential use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter I wanted to raise is somewhat closer to home&mdash;the question of telephone numbering and telephone zones. This is a particular issue in my electorate of Werriwa. The seat spans the south-west of Sydney. Two-thirds of the seat, from Minto north, is in the 02 telephone zone, and the bottom third, or southern third of the seat, is in the 046 telephone zone. So the northern two-thirds of my electorate is within the Sydney metropolitan zone and the bottom one-third of the electorate is in the 046 zone. This is a particular issue in my electorate. I would hope that if competition and technological progress in telecommunications is to bring benefits to average Australians&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="REID" NAMEID="VT4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VT4">Mr Reid</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A bit of competition might help that.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Bendigo interrupts that more competition might help. I hope that is the case. If competition in telecommunications is to bring benefits, surely one of the benefits must be a breakdown in the artificial barriers, the archaic telephone zones, that Sydney has inherited from a time when Sydney was much smaller.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has always been the irony of the 02 zone. The eastern half of that zone&mdash;if you draw the full circle&mdash;is across the ocean because the zone is centred on the Sydney CBD. It was drawn in a configuration when Sydney was a much smaller place, when Campbelltown, which is now disadvantaged by being placed in the 046 zone, was literally a country town. It is no more in the country these days than any other part of the great 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="79"> Sydney metropolis. As a consequence, businesses and residential phone users in the city of Campbelltown are extremely disadvantaged by having to pay more by virtue of their location in the 046 telephone zone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If competition is to bring a benefit to consumers, I could not imagine a greater benefit than on the urban fringe. This applies in Sydney not only for the 046 zone but also for the 047 zone and right through to the 043 telephone zone on the central coast. As we have more active competition and a greater number of residential telephone providers, they should be actively competing in the urban fringe market to break down the sort of disadvantage that consumers have suffered for far too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the problem. Citizens in the southern portion of my electorate in Campbelltown are no different to citizens in the northern part&mdash;no different in their lifestyle, no different in their commuting habits and no different in their economic development and employment requirements&mdash;but they are treated very differently in their telephone consumption. That should not be the case in a period when technology is advancing so rapidly and when competition promises to deliver so much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the government to address this serious issue. It is most acute in terms of business development. I mentioned that the boundary between the 02 metropolitan telephone zone and the 046 zone cuts through the suburb of Minto in my electorate. Minto actually has an industrial estate. You can tell the business consequences of this. The portion of the Minto industrial estate in the 02 zone&mdash;that is, the northern portion&mdash;is fully built out. There is full economic development and location of firms in that part of the estate. Where they move into the 046 zone&mdash;you can literally see the divide at the boundary between the two zones&mdash;there is no take&hyphen;up of the residential land. Business is obviously discouraged by the fact that they would be located in the 046 zone and have much higher telephone costs in the normal conduct of their business activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can give the House some examples of what this means in practice. On 1 May last 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> year I placed a question&mdash;question No. 35&mdash;on notice to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who represents the Minister for Communications and the Arts, to try to flesh out and gain the detail about the level of disadvantage in the two telephone zones within my seat. I was disappointed that the minister would not provide information about the unit cost of telephone calls out of the 046 zone. He said that that information was commercial-in-confidence. As long as Telstra is publicly owned&mdash;it still is majority publicly owned&mdash;I think there is an important responsibility to have some information available to the public as to how its cost structure is framed and what element of cost recovery or more applies in that 046 telephone zone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a bit disappointed that the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts&mdash;he has now joined us in the House&mdash;was not able to provide that information. I suppose his hands were tied. The useful part of his answer was just to point out the difference in telephone charges from 02, the Liverpool portion of my electorate, to 046, the Campbelltown portion. For instance, to make a telephone call, day or night, out of Liverpool to the Sydney CBD&mdash;this must be the most frequent call that businesses in my electorate make&mdash;there is a 25c flat charge. The local call rate applies. The Campbelltown portion of my electorate, to the south&mdash;in some instances, merely 100 metres from one business to the other as the boundary is formed&mdash;the rate is 25c per three&hyphen;minute call. That is a severe disadvantage for businesses that frequently make their calls to the Sydney CBD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Blacktown, from the 02 portion at Liverpool, a 25c flat amount is charged day and night. From the Campbelltown 046 zone there is a 12c per minute charge by day and nearly 9c per minute at night. In Dural the same figures apply, essentially. In Avalon Beach to the north of Sydney the community call rate of 25c per three&hyphen;minute period applies from Liverpool. Then the night time call is up towards 9c per minute from Campbelltown to the northern suburbs of Sydney. This is undoubtedly an artificial and unfair barrier to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="80"> economic development at the southern part of my electorate. The government needs to do something about this to try to accelerate the way in which competition might deal with this particular problem. It is a major concern right around the Sydney urban fringe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked a question to that effect, question No. 476, placed on notice on 25 June. All that the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts could tell me was that the charging arrangements in the electoral division of Werriwa are consistent with those applying to similar areas throughout Australia. I know that that is not the case. I invite the member for Bass&mdash;I know he comes to Sydney a bit these days; I was in Tasmania and noted the speculation about that&mdash;to visit the Minto industrial estate in my electorate and see for himself that the portion of the estate within the 02 zone to the north is fully taken up by industrial development. The portion to the south&mdash;the 046 telephone zone, an extra telephony cost&mdash;is totally vacant. There is no take&hyphen;up rate at all for industrial development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a major source of economic disadvantage for the southern portion of my electorate. That also applies to the electorate of Macarthur. I know that the member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey) does not do a lot for his electorate, least of all on aviation matters, but at least he should get active on this issue. I would invite him to join my campaign to bring some fairness to the way in which telephone calls are levied throughout the south&hyphen;western portion of Sydney, right through from Minto and Campbelltown and on to Camden and those growing suburbs in the seat of Macarthur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something needs to be done about this. We have heard a lot about technological progress in telecommunications and we have heard a lot about the potential benefits of competition. Let us see some evidence of it and let us see this government try to advance benefits as quickly as possible to end the inequity in the 046 zone. People in Campbelltown should be treated the same as those in Liverpool. They are all part of the Sydney metropolitan area in their lifestyle and economic employment aspirations. The sooner the government ends 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this artificial barrier that has been there for so long, the sooner people will feel that they are being treated fairly by the telecommunications regulations set by the Commonwealth parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K6">Mr BILLSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thought you may have indulged me with maybe eight lines, compared to the member for Werriwa's eight minutes, on the subject. The Telecommunications Amendment Bill and the associated bill on numbering fees are relatively small but still important parts of the coalition government's creation of a fair and certain regulatory environment for one of Australia's economic powerhouse sectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The telecommunications industry has been a star performer over the past few years. In 1986-87 the communications industry's turnover was about $6.5 billion, or two per cent of gross domestic product. Nine years later, in 1995-96, the sector comprised 3.6 per cent of GDP, its total output a massive $15.3 billion dollars. There are not too many industry sectors which have almost doubled their contribution to GDP in under 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite some recent pessimism about employment in the telecommunications sector, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="81"> employment opportunities have grown strongly. While employment figures include postal and courier services, these are not major employers in this sector. It is interesting to note that in Victoria the job rise in this sector has been a creditable 27.3 per cent over that period, compared with an Australia-wide rise of 14.6 per cent. So things are happening in Victoria in this sector. These bills go some way towards encouraging that continuing growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the forthcoming era of open competition in the telecommunications sector from July, the industry has a chance to power ahead even further. Of course, the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra will give that major player the freedom and ability to continue to grow even more strongly. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has noted, the partial sale of Telstra will allow Telstra employees who live in Dunkley and elsewhere to own shares, and this will help Telstra to be even more responsive to the needs of its customers, and will enable Telstra to focus more on growing its business opportunities.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="DEPUTY SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! I invite the honourable minister at the table to observe standing order 57.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K6">Mr BILLSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Telstra's own capacity and experience will ensure that it is a fierce competitor in its own right, a position that need not be further enhanced by special service telephone numbers being captive to it or any other established service provider. Other companies such as Optus and AAP Telecommunications will also be able to focus on the increasing potential of the sector, which is changing almost every other week. The growth of the Internet and other new technologies which were unheard of 10 years ago means that the focus has to shift towards asking what the customer wants rather than asking, as was the case 20 years ago, what the telecommunications company's engineers want for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The diversity and responsiveness of telecommunications technology, carriers and service providers will further flourish under the regulatory regime being pursued by this government. These bills seek to ensure that an important and finite resource within the sector 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is properly managed and that the community can enjoy optimum emergency service response at a time of competing and changing methods of service provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of a fair regulatory environment is ensuring that assets that can be used by more than one service provider are not unfairly available to one company to the exclusion of others. The Telecommunications (Numbering Fees) Amendment Bill 1996 will provide for carriers and service providers to be charged for an allocation of blocks of numbers that they receive from Austel, the telecommunications industry umpire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Efficient and fair use of telephone numbers is important. The staged changes to telephone numbers, in line with Austel's national numbering plan, have proceeded smoothly. My office has received very few complaints about the change in Mornington and Frankston South numbers from an 059 to an 0359 prefix, other than in relation to the issue of metropolitan codes, which I very briefly alluded to earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The growth in telephone number usage overall brings home the realisation that the numbers are a finite resource. They cannot be used in a fickle or cavalier manner, or hoarded for a rainy day or for anti-competitive reasons by telecommunications companies and service providers. These bills ensure that the chances of this happening are minimised, because stockpiling of telephone numbers by an established provider will not be free of commercial implications and will not be allowed as a tactic to bar new entrants into the telecommunications sector under the provisions of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has decided to protect business and residential customers who use standard telephone numbers from any charges for allocation of these numbers. So a number such as 03 9781 223, my electorate office number, or an O359 number, will not attract a charge from Austel when it is allocated to Telstra, Optus or any other carrier or service provider and in turn provided to the residents and businesses of Dunkley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A ministerial direction will be issued to prevent a charge being levied for the allocation of basic telephone numbers used by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="82"> mainstream residential and business users. However, premium special service numbers are likely to attract the highest charges. These special network, freecall and information service numbers, such as the 13, 1800 and 0055 series, have a significant commercial appeal over and above the value added services that attach to them. The bill seeks to ensure that the broader community benefits from the commercial appeal and relative value of a select range of telephone numbers made available to carriers for their commercial exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commonwealth revenue is expected to benefit to the tune of $30 million as a result of the charging scheme, a very small percentage of the revenue these numbers generate for carriers and service providers. The minister, the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), mentioned in his second reading speech how carriers have been pocketing windfall gains of millions of dollars when they have charged their own customers for 13 six-digit Australia-wide numbers, 0055 information service numbers, which have nine digits, and the 1 800 freecall 10-digit numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An experience more familiar to me and the people of Dunkley would be our contact with pizza businesses. Whether it be the Pizza Hut's 13 11 66 number or Pizza Haven's 13 12 41 number or the like, their whole argument around convenience and their marketing campaign turns on their 13 numbers and on building consumer recall of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance and commercial value of their 13 number is obvious. In fact, for Pizza Hut its 13 number appears to have replaced direct access to its establishments via basic telephone services. Despite recently dialling the Frankston restaurant directly&mdash;I might add that some of the health conscious remarks about KFCs over the Christmas break that we have heard around the place I have not translated into my pizza eating habits&mdash;that call was routed through the now centralised phone order centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On my way home from Melbourne, I had to first explain why I wanted to collect our pizza from a store that was convenient to my travel, establish which store that was, convince the operator that that was where I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wanted to pick it up and then actually place an order. So their whole customer service system is being built around their 13 number, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am happy to discuss that further with you if you are having difficulty ordering pizzas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Optus's published tariffs include a monthly charge reflecting the intrinsic value of a particular number. This intrinsic value is based on the ease of recognition of patterns of digits. For mobile digital services, Optus can charge an initial administration fee of $100 and an ongoing monthly charge of between $10 and $170, depending on the level of intrinsic value. Optus's total access service charges include a number usage fee for numbers with intrinsic value. A connection premium of an additional $350 is charged for keyword numbers and monthly access fees range from $600 to $3,000 for other classes of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Monthly fees of up to $625 are charged for reserving numbers that perhaps are not even in use. Some numbers carry the additional requirement of having at least tens of thousands of dollars worth of calls recorded on them each month if the customer is to retain that number. Clearly, special service numbers can be extremely lucrative and should not be made available free of charge to a few established carriers for substantial commercial benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austel is still consulting with carriers, service providers and groups such as the Numbering Advisory Committee on the final method of charging to be adopted, but many numbers will individually attract charges of less than $1 when they are allocated as part of a block. I understand that the most likely option is for numbers with the most digits, such as the 190 series, to attract the smallest charge because there is a clear attraction to customers in easily dialling a 13 six&hyphen;digit number by comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Optus clearly has already developed a commercially accepted method of determining the intrinsic value of different numbers based on the ease of recognition of digits or a key word. This methodology could well be the basis of future consultations with Austel on how the charging system should operate. For 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="83"> example, I believe that a number such as 13 13 13 or 13 13 00, the Qantas and Ansett Australia numbers respectively, should attract a higher provider charge than the 13 22 32 number that the national rail reservations service operates from, because the first two are clearly more readily remembered and therefore have a higher value in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill establishes a maximum charge for an individual number of $100,000. While a tender bid system for each number has some appeal and may maximise government revenue, it is acknowledged that if this is to be instituted for already allocated numbers there could be some disruption to consumers who might not wish to change their carrier or service provider or run the risk of an allocated number perhaps changing hands. Instead, the charges that Austel will determine will be disallowable instruments, so parliament will have the opportunity to scrutinise the level of charges. Carriers and service providers who, say, pay $200,000 for a block of numbers will be able to levy differential charges on the numbers they perceive as the most and least valuable to their respective customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, when this bill is passed there will be an incentive for carriers such as Telstra and Optus who might have been allocated large blocks of numbers to return unused series to Austel for redistribution to new entrants. This is most important because a new carrier or service provider without reasonable ready access to telephone numbers as well as reasonable access charges is like a week in Melbourne without a special event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telephone numbers affected by the Telecommunications (Numbering Fees) Amendment Bill 1996 are a public resource. It is appropriate that the government recover a part of the costs of their provision to telecommunications companies and service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other bill that we are discussing today, the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1996, relates to the Telecommunications Act 1991. It gives Austel the authority to actually collect the numbering fee charges imposed by the legislation I have just spoken of as well as clarifying exemptions for employees of carriers and service providers who disclose 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> customer information to emergency service operators. My colleague the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) will discuss this matter in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me simply say that the act currently provides for this information to be provided directly to police, fire and ambulance service officers but not directly to people who are contracted by these emergency services to assist in the call response and dispatch system. I would hate to see constituents in the electorate of Dunkley disadvantaged purely because of a decision by a government on how it chooses to provide those emergency services, perhaps involving a private contractor, meaning that information which is available is not conveyed to those emergency service personnel, is held back for fear of prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated above, these two bills are part of the coalition government's emphasis on encouraging the telecommunications industry&mdash;a provider of critically important services to business and householders, a sector that can grow, guided by a fair and contemporary regulatory system. While less momentous than the comprehensive industry competition and regulation package to be debated in the House later in this session, these bills are nonetheless important. I am confident that over the next few years the quality of service provided by an increasing number of carriers and service providers who will enter the market will only improve under these sorts of reforms. I commend the bills to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few brief comments on a very important aspect of the telecommunications legislation. They relate to the amendments to the Telecommunications Act relating to disclosure of information to emergency services which implement minor policy changes that are necessary to address recent changes in the way that telecommunications companies and emergency services interact and coordinate their respective operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My reason for doing this is that we are constantly reminded in Victoria and in Australia that we do live in fire prone environments. No-one needs to be reminded of this, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="84"> with the recent tragic loss of life and damage to homes in Victoria. The need for our emergency services to be able to coordinate their respective operations with the telecommunications system in Australia is vitally important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill in fact amends section 88 of the act to permit information about persons telephoning for emergency assistance to be disclosed to emergency service operators where calls are made on any telephone number identified by Austel as an emergency number in the national numbering plan. The fact is that 000 is now not the only emergency number&mdash;112 has also been specified by Austel in the numbering plan as an alternative number for callers using mobile phones. There is also a proposal to allocate another short number for access by the hearing and speech impaired, who must currently call a 1800 number to access emergency services as access through the 000 number is impractical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to return briefly to the role that was played by our emergency services during the tragic fires in Victoria and pay a compliment to all of the members of our emergency services&mdash;the Victoria Police, the Country Fire Authority, the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the state emergency services, the Red Cross, the Salvation Army and all of the welfare agents who do play a vital role in assisting when we do have an outbreak of fire in parts of Australia, particularly in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will keep my comments brief, but I believe that this is a very important matter being addressed in this bill. I compliment the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who is at the table, for his role in this and also the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senate Alston) in another place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I want to take a few moments to summarise the debate. Firstly, I thank the members for Werriwa (Mr Latham), Dunkley (Mr Billson) and Bendigo (Mr Reid) for their contributions, particularly the members for Dunkley and Bendigo, who elaborated on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> second reading speech when we introduced these two bills late last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dunkley talked at length about the concerns and the rationale behind changing the numbering fee charging system. It will be done by Austel, the experts in this field. It will be a disallowable instrument and it will reflect the true value of those numbers&mdash;they have been talking about specialised numbers, not about the standard or business connection phones&mdash;to recoup, to the benefit of taxpayers and the Commonwealth, significant amounts of money because of the value of those numbers. I thank him for his contribution which was very erudite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Bendigo referred to the other bill that is being introduced primarily in relation to emergency services, and what is emerging as an increasing reliance on emergency services being accessed other than by 000 numbers. He did not mention at any length the privacy considerations, but they are also taken care of in that amendment bill. I thank him for his remarks about those matters that we see as a proliferation. He mentioned the TTY services for the hearing impaired, for example. It is extremely important that they be able to access emergency services. He cited the recent difficulties in Victoria where we saw the requirement because of the fires for people to access emergency services very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was one point that was mentioned by the members for Werriwa and Dunkley and it related to zonal charging arrangements. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I think you even mentioned it yourself. Communities outside urban centres have difficulties with the charging regimes because of these zonal arrangements. This was identified in a report in 1989 called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS>. It has been a continuing issue. I think the member for Werriwa, in a moment of complete honesty, indicated that this has been a problem for some considerable time. I notice that the shadow minister at the table, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), was the Minister for Transport and Communications at the time we first started to discuss how to deal with this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some arrangements put in place to extend untimed charging zones. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="85"> Those matters will obviously continue to be considered by the carriers and the government. Difficulties arise at times, and of course we are aware of those. We hope that as we move to a more highly deregulated and competitive arrangement in telecommunications these issues will be addressed successfully to the benefit of consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With those few remarks, I thank those speakers for contributing and commend the House for its anticipated support of both of these matters. They are important matters. They are interim in nature until the full package of telecommunications legislation is passed by the House and the Senate to reflect the changes that have been made now to become part of that total reform package, which will take effect in the middle of the year.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for a government to introduce a Charter of Budget Honesty Bill when it has been responsible for the most dishonest budget probably introduced into this country since Federation. How can the government credibly choose to talk about budget honesty when in last year's budget they broke at a minimum $17 billion worth of promises? To give just a sampling of the scores of broken promises that did occur in last year's budget, let me mention these: for a start, the coalition promised `to maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC'. That was broken before the budget with there now being a $209 million cut to the ABC scheduled over a four&hyphen;year period. The coalition promise that it had no plans `whatever to change the operational subsidy to the community based long day care sector' was broken by the budget abolishing operational subsidies for community based long day care which will increase fees by at least $14 per child per week.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important for me as the member for Namadgi and as a member of the ACT community to bring to the attention of members of the House, should it so miss their attention, that Access Economics&mdash;a firm I think people on the benches opposite know quite well&mdash;had the job last week of announcing that the ACT is now formally in a recession and a very serious one. In no part is the blame for this due to anybody other than the Liberal-coalition government federally and the Liberal government at the ACT level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing continuing unemployment in the ACT holding at a very alarming level, particularly in relation to youth unemployment. We are seeing the effects of the government's cuts to higher education, the changes to HECS and the impact that these decisions are having within the ACT. We are seeing in the ACT a dramatic and continuing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="86"> fall in house values&mdash;not house prices per se but house values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in the community are alarmed to the point of despair as to what they believe they have done to deserve such treatment from a government of this calibre, particularly when we recall not that far back the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) kept making statements such as, `We will govern for all of us. This is a parliament and a government for all of us.' It seems that the government has excised the ACT out of the map of Australia, because I cannot think of any other reason why the ACT is being treated in such a draconian fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most alarming thing about Access Economics' announcement that we are now in a formal recession is that this really cements very clearly in the community's mind the fear that they have been suffering and experiencing over the last few months. I do not think I can recall in all of the many years that I have lived in the ACT a lack of confidence both on the part of individuals and on the part of some business in this town as to their degree of spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was speaking to a family last week who live in my electorate, in the Tuggeranong Valley. The gentleman concerned is a middle ranging public servant whose wife works part time. They have two old bombs of cars. They decided a few months ago that they would trade them both in and get a new car, but they have not done that. They have not done that because they are scared to spend their money. They are scared because they do not know whether either or both of them will have their job next week or next month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This couple are not an isolated case; they are typical of many ordinary families&mdash;who, I might add, I thought this government was standing up for&mdash;who are terrified that their future tenure in this community is at such threat that they will not spend their money, if in fact they have any. The ongoing effect of that is that you have this down spiralling of economic confidence and business suffers as a result. Because of this lack of confidence, you have businesses unwilling or scared to employ anybody new.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The forthcoming budget in May is being treated with a certain amount of dread in this country. We have already received dramatic cuts not only to the public sector, which we talk about often, but to government spending in sectors of private industry which have until now had a viable future in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The feeling amongst the community now is: what on earth will this forthcoming budget hold for our community? What sorts of cuts will continue? What will they be? At what level will they be? What sort of rate will they be held at? More importantly than ever from the community point of view: at what price will those cuts occur?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does the government and the Prime Minister really care what they are doing to the national capital? Not only do we have a community here of families of ordinary working&hyphen;class people; we also happen to live in&mdash;and are very proud of the fact that we live in and support&mdash;the national capital of this wonderful country. Tourists to the ACT are very proud to see the ACT look the way it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No wonder the people in the electorate of Fraser last weekend voted to the point where we will hold the seat of Fraser on a two-party preferred basis by the biggest margin we have ever held that seat by. Surely to heaven the government and the Prime Minister must get a message from that. Enough is enough. Stop doing this to the national capital. Stop raping and pillaging this community and start to realise that you are having an effect on a range of people who have done nothing to deserve it. They deserve no more nor less than any other people in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before in this House I have mentioned the Bunya Bunya rural training program. Just very quickly to recap, this program is undertaken by Fusion Australia at the former 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="87"> Marsden Home for Boys situated at Kallangur in my electorate. The rural training program basically addresses the needs of very disadvantaged youth. I speak in particular of young people who have in many respects come on the wrong side of the law, have come from broken homes and are very difficult to manage and, more particularly, to get into and keep in a program of this nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was my great pleasure just before Christmas to attend the Marsden home for the graduation ceremony of six graduates from this course. Seven people were enrolled in the course, but one could not complete for a number of reasons that were not relevant to the capacity of the trainers. Six people completed the course and all six were placed in out-stations all around Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and parts of Queensland, I am pleased to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that graduation ceremony we witnessed a number of demonstrations by these boys&mdash;the course is also open to girls&mdash;all aged between 18 and 22. We saw such things as the use of the tractors; riding of horses; operation of chainsaws, in particular in relation to fencing; and some skills in relation to the growing of small crops. It was a great pleasure to be there and present these boys with their graduation certificates and, as well, to hear them speak about the pleasures and benefits that they gained from doing such a course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I emphasise how important this is to the community and how, whilst in this particular case the trainers had an almost 100 per cent success rate in terms of outcome, we ought not necessarily focus on outcomes as an economic rationalist way of looking at training in this particular case. We should have regard to the nature of the boys who come to do these courses&mdash;their background and the sorts of problems they have had in the community. The fact is that it is saving the community an awful lot of money to have them training in this way and also going to jobs rather than have them on the wrong side of the law, re&hyphen;offending and causing enormous social dislocation in the community. So I was very pleased to see that they did graduate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I have since had an unfortunate occurrence. I have now been told by Fusion that the department has come back to them and said that their outcomes are not sufficient and that they need better outcomes overall. Figures were produced to show that over a period of time their outcomes were down to about 25 per cent. As the head of the program said to me, `Well, anyone can produce figures. We had 100 per cent last time.' Apparently, they have looked into the system and found that over time a number of people have gone back on unemployment benefits. However, the fact of the matter is that, even if only 25 per cent of these boys and girls are placed in work, in a situation where we are dealing with this sort of disadvantaged youth we are achieving great outcomes and savings to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, any criteria on the basis that there must be guarantees in relation to outcomes really has to be looked at again, since it has been said to me by the trainer that they are looking for a guarantee that there will be a 70 per cent outcome. In my respectful opinion, that is not realistic in relation to disadvantaged youths in circumstances such as these.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I hope that this situation will be reviewed and that there will be a continuation of the Bunya Bunya training program. It is serving the people of Dickson, serving the people of Pine Rivers and, overall, saving the community enormous sums of money by not having these people incarcerated.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="87"><TITLE>Blacktown City Chamber of Commerce and Industry</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this adjournment debate I would like to speak about the work of the Blacktown City Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This chamber has been promoting business and employment growth in western Sydney for over 40 years. The chamber represents some 1,000 businesses in western Sydney and is active in seeking ways to assist both business and local communities by promoting full employment and business opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chamber was active during the term of the previous government in promoting labour 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="88"> market programs and is equally interested in continuing this cooperation. To this end, the chamber recently accepted responsibility to promote traineeships as part of a national program which has proved to be of enormous assistance in providing trained candidates with employment. The chamber's responsibility in this program is designed to promote traineeships from the Hawkesbury through to Burwood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, DEETYA, Nettforce and the Blacktown City Chamber of Commerce and Industry are working together with group and industry training companies on a pilot program. John Camp, who is the chamber's regional training marketing consultant, is one of 10 consultants who has been selected to coordinate this national program. With the upcoming Olympic Games, considerable employment growth is expected in western Sydney. Industries such as the media, information technology, sport and recreation, hospitality and business services will attract future employees and apprentices of all ages. With progressive organisations like the chamber operating in the region to tap into major projects like the Olympic Games, the prospect for employment of young people should improve considerably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already the success of this program is evident. In the December period the chamber handled 55 successful placements&mdash;15 were apprenticeships and 40 were traineeships. As the facilitator and coordinator, the chamber is putting into practice the very plans and policies that were the hallmark of the previous Labor government's approach to labour market issues; that is, involving all the local community in the problems and the solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chamber, through its chief executive officer, is an active member of the Blacktown Workplace Learning Committee which, for over three years, has been promoting workplace learning for local year 11 and 12 school children in industries. The chamber has developed close links with over 50 government, education and community groups in this region to promote business opportunities. In addition to those that I have already mentioned, these include the Blacktown City 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Council, TAFE, the University of Western Sydney, Skillshare, the Salvation Army, the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre and the Blacktown Aboriginal Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chamber is administered by a full-time chief executive officer, Ms Bev Norton, who has been the CEO for five years. Ms Norton has a full-time staff of 10 professional and clerical employees. Bev Norton, prior to becoming the CEO, held the position of president and vice-president during her 26 years of association with the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chamber is currently considering a project for 1997&mdash;the development of a research department. This department will determine the needs, strengths and weaknesses of small business at a local government, regional and state basis. The purpose of this project would be to develop a structure that could establish information relating to the reasons for the success or failure of small business in a defined area, to determine areas where additional training is required and to advise governments on legislative changes to assist small business. The research project is aimed at a wider area than western Sydney and would focus particularly on small- to medium-sized businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the project is aimed at improving economic development, increasing membership, improving services to members, obtaining information to lobby government, training in public relations development and establishing a statistical research unit which would be able to be self-funding. The chamber would be seeking funding from DEETYA to assist them to set up and train the research team. There is sufficient evidence available, based on previous successful chamber projects, for this particular idea to be the subject of further joint investigation. As the federal member for this area, I would be actively supporting this chamber's many employment generating projects.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="88"><TITLE>Lilley Australia Day Awards</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was also special about this year's awards was that the recipients came from a wide range of age groups and were involved in a wide variety of community activities. These activities included community service, education, sport, youth, cultural and environmental activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The day was a great success and really made me proud to be an Australian. Before the presentation ceremony, we were entertained by a local poet called Herb Wegener, who is a bush poet from the old school. His poems were very original and laced with good old Australian humour. Bishop John Gerry, the auxiliary bishop for Brisbane, and I proudly presented the 53 quiet achievers with their commemorative badges and certificates. A shiver went up my spine when the day was capped off with over 500 people singing <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Fair</EMPHASIS> in unison and waving miniature Australian flags.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to begin by advising the House of some public meetings in my own electorate, called by residents in opposition to a plan by Vodafone to build a 30&hyphen;metre telecommunications tower in Bon Mace Crescent in Tumbi Umbi. The first I learned of this was in mid&hyphen;January when local residents advised me that they were planning to hold a public meeting a couple of days later in a park adjacent to the proposed site of the Vodafone tower. That public meeting was surprisingly well attended, with 150 to 200 local residents expressing their opposition to Vodafone's plans to build the mobile phone tower in an area that has quite a dense residential population and is relatively close to a number of local schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a number of questions from members of the public to the mayor, Doug Eaton, and me about whether we were aware that Vodafone had originally sought an alternate site&mdash;an alternate site that some members of the public thought was on a ridge away from the residential population at a location in Anderson Road. The mayor advised the 150 residents that he had checked this out and it was incorrect. I discovered a few days later that, contrary to the mayor's claims and the advice that he had given to the residents at the public meeting, Vodafone did in fact lodge a formal application with Wyong Council to build the tower on a ridge in Anderson Road in Berkeley Vale. I am very pleased that, at its last meeting, Wyong Council reconsidered its position and has now resolved to oppose Vodafone's second pre ferred site in Bon Mace Crescent, Tumbi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="90"> Umbi, and the council is now willing to accept Vodafone's original site of the ridge in Anderson Road, Berkeley Vale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I hope Vodafone takes note of the council's new position of supporting the site in Anderson Road. It is certainly the very strong view of the people who work in the industrial estate at Tumbi Umbi and the local residents who live in Berkeley Vale nearby that Vodafone should go back to their original site on the ridge in Anderson Road, Berkeley Vale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to take this opportunity to express my concern about plans by this government to provide an additional period to telephone companies to be exempt from the local and state planning laws. I think at the moment the  Minister for Communications and the Arts, Richard Alston, is planning to allow the telephone companies an additional two months past the 1 July deadline this year to be exempt from the planning power, and I think that is something we should resist wholeheartedly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think we have to be careful about any transitional provisions that allow telephone companies to build willy&hyphen;nilly these mobile telephone towers simply because they have lodged some notification with the local council. If 1 July comes and a telephone company hasn't finished the construction of the tower, the government's transitional provision shouldn't allow the telephone companies in effect to have an exemption from the federal and state planning powers for years to come. I think that 1 July deadline should be quite firm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue I would like to raise tonight concerns the environment. I would like to express my concern about a number of changes that the government made in last year's budget that will affect a number of local people on the Central Coast who will be able to work on employment improvement projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the LEAP scheme in 1995&hyphen;96 we had 920 commencements by local unemployed people on not just the Central Coast but the wider Hunter northern area but not including Newcastle. In my own electorate, they carried out bush regeneration and the construction of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nature trails in Ourimbah, landscaping and planting native gardens at a number of schools in the Wyong district and beautification of local parks. A lot of good work was done under LEAP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year the government has axed LEAP and tried to replace it with the Green Corps. Unfortunately, the Green Corps projects that have been announced to date do not include any projects on the New South Wales Central Coast. In fact, only 440 places will be funded Australia&hyphen;wide&mdash;much less than in 1996&hyphen;97 and much less than the 920 we had in our own local regional area. I would hope to have the support of my colleague the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) in asking the government to perhaps reconsider its decision to axe LEAP and, at the very least, to match the Labor government's ability to provide 920 placements on the Central Coast and in the Hunter northern region in this financial year.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="90"><TITLE>Environment

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, in response to the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), obviously I will be supporting the need for the Green Corps on the Central Coast. There are other initiatives which are happening on the Central Coast. Only last week, under the coast care and dune care initiatives, I announced five separate projects in my electorate to help with the regeneration of our environment on the Central Coast. So the government is doing something about the environment on the Central Coast. I certainly will be pushing for additional Green Corps funding, as well as supporting the member for Dobell in that initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I want to raise my concerns about interest rates, particularly high business loan overdraft rates. Home loan interest rates have continued to fall by up to 2&half; per cent since the coalition took office less than 12 months ago, to the lowest levels in 30 years, creating massive savings for families and first home buyers in the range of $188 per month. Coupled with continued low inflation and sound economic management by our govern ment, most Australians can look forward to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="91"> 1997 and beyond with optimism and confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I wish to raise my concerns over business interest rates. Whilst banking deregulation has seen intense competition in the home loan market, business interest rates have remained unacceptably high. During 1996, we saw the major banks announce massive profits. On 12 November last year, Westpac announced a net annual profit of $1.13 billion. On 20 November, the ANZ Banking Group announced, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, a dazzling, higher than expected profit of $1.116 billion for 1995&hyphen;96. The National Australia Bank also released a record net profit of $2.1 billion. Even the St George Bank released a 1996 net profit of $148.3 million&mdash;a rise of nine per cent over 1995. I understand that these financial institutions have obligations to their shareholders, but I also believe the major banks have an obligation to pass on reductions in official interest rates to the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst home loan interest rates have fallen to levels that we have not seen in this country for 30 years, business and personal loans remain high. Businesses are still burdened with interest rates of 14 per cent or higher, with penalty rates of up to 17 per cent if you should exceed your overdraft limit, even for one day. In addition, many banks have now introduced increased charges; for example, $15 for each and every cheque that is cashed while the business account remains in excess of the approved overdraft limit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For 13 years small businesses suffered under a Labor government that had no idea how to run the economy&mdash;a government that presided over record interest rates and unacceptably high levels of inflation. Thousands of small businesses were destroyed by the recession that we had to have. Thousands of families were destroyed, dreams shattered, lives shattered. Only now can small business begin to invest with confidence in the sound economic environment of consistently low interest rates and low inflation. Major banks must begin to offer more competitive loans for businesses and examine some of their many charges and fees which are a disincen 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tive to invest, to expand and, most importantly, to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast relies heavily on small business. We have few major employers, but we have a vital economy with new businesses opening up every day. Robertson is the fastest growing electorate in New South Wales and the seventh fastest in Australia. We need the banks to get off the back of small business and to pass on the falls in official interest rates not only to home loans but to business overdrafts as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's efforts to revitalise small business are being stifled and blocked at every corner by the attitude of the major banks: by their never&hyphen;ending increasing fees and charges, by their unwillingness to pass on realistic lower  interest rates, and by the distinct change in attitude that has occurred in relation to customer service by the major banking organisations over the past decade. It would appear that the banks are preoccupied with profit, preoccupied with forcing customers to use electronic and telephone banking services and preoccupied with the reduction of branches and staffing levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another negative by&hyphen;product of this attitude is the lack of savings incentives, particularly for young people. Australians have a dangerously low level of savings, and yet the big brother, standover attitude that is often experienced when young people attempt to open savings accounts is hardly conducive to creating increased savings habits. There is something drastically wrong when you receive three per cent to save and yet are charged 15 per cent to establish a business investing in the future of this nation and creating jobs for all Australians. This cannot be allowed to continue.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="91"><TITLE>Unemployment</TITLE>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="92">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mid&hyphen;year Economic and Fiscal Outlook released by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the last few days with great fanfare is a searing indictment of the government's attitude to continuing high unemployment. Page 1 of the Mid&hyphen;year Economic and Fiscal Outlook refers to growth in GDP of 3&half; per cent expected in 1996&hyphen;97, unchanged from the forecast at budget time. The paper then refers to it being accompanied by moderate but continuing employment growth, and the forecast for employment growth is unchanged. On page 4 of the outlook document we see the comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The labour market is expected to improve, but only at a pace sufficient to generate a gradual decline in the unemployment rate. Achieving faster reductions in unemployment will be dependent upon opportunities taken to adopt more flexible arrangements in the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When you turn to the key table on page 4, you find that, so far as the labour market is concerned, the employment forecast  has not changed from the budget to the revised forecast. The participation rate from the budget forecast to the revised forecast has not changed either&mdash;63&frac34;per cent. But, for the unemployment rate, the forecast is from the budget forecast of 8&frac14; per cent to an increased revised forecast of 8&half; per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we see the government presiding over 3&half; per cent growth in GDP in the economy, with increasing unemployment. What commitment do we see from them on reducing unemployment? The only commitment we see from them is the mystical solution that achieving faster reductions in unemployment will depend upon opportunities taken to adopt more flexible arrangements in the labour market. They are handcuffed to that. When those changes do not improve unemployment one iota, the government will stand absolutely condemned.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="11 p.m." PAGE="92"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">House adjourned at 11 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT><RDI PAGE="92"><TITLE>REPLIES TO REQUESTS FOR DETAILED INFORMATION</TITLE><RDI.ITEM PAGE="92"><TITLE>Rwwanda: Gallantry Medals</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a question for you, Mr Speaker, and I do concur in the remarks that you made. As 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you know, a number of members and senators were privileged to visit Rwanda and Kibeho, the camp where the massacre subsequently occurred.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thank you for your letter of 9 December 1996 concerning the presentation of the Rwanda Gallantry Medals and the various suggestions contained within.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With respect to Mr Price's question as to whether Members of Parliament who visited Rwanda might have been present to witness the presentation of the medals, the Investiture Ceremony was organised by Government House and my office had no involvement in the determination of the invitation list. However the Opposition Spokesman for Defence was invited and attended the ceremony.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In response to the question put to you by the Leader of the Opposition proposing a parliamentary statement on the medal presentation, the Chief of the Defence Force made a public announcement of the awards on the 25th November 1996 with little resulting publicity. I then decided that the use of question time was the most appropriate forum to give these people the proper public recognition they deserved. I do not believe that the awarding of Gallantry Medals should be a matter for debate which a Ministerial statement would entail.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In relation to your suggestion of assembling the medal recipients in the House of Representatives Gallery to be recognised by the Chair, the four recipients of the Medal for Gallantry are based in Townsville QLD, Kapooka NSW, Swanbourne WA and Heatley QLD respectively and it would be impractical and costly to assemble them in Canberra in the short amount of time available during the current sittings.

Extra funding for Supplementary Services (SUPS) and for additional hands&hyphen;on care for children with `high needs', particularly children with a disability, will assist these centres to continue to provide care for these children.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sydney (Kingsford&hyphen;Smith) Airport</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) 12 August 1991. A McDonnell Douglas DC&hyphen;10 Series 30ER aircraft (DC&hyphen;10) was landing on runway 34 at Sydney (Kingsford&hyphen;Smith) Airport. At the same time, an Airbus A320&hyphen;211 aircraft (A320), was on a short final approach for landing on runway 25. Runways 34 and 25 intersect, and Simultaneous Runway Operations (SIMOPS) were in progress. Landing instructions to the crew of the DC&hyphen;10 included a requirement for the aircraft to be held short of the intersection of runways 34 and 25. A Boeing B747 aircraft was holding on taxiway Victor (EVE), north of runway 25 and west of runway 34, awaiting the landing of the A320 and a subsequent clearance to cross runway 07/25. While observing the DC&hyphen;10's landing roll, the captain of the A320 judged that the DC&hyphen;10 might not stop before the intersection of the runways. He elected to initiate a go&hyphen;around from a low height above the runway. Under heavy braking, the DC&hyphen;10 slowed to about 2 knots ground speed, at which time the nose of the aircraft was approximately level with the edge of runway 07/25. During the go&hyphen;around executed by the crew of the A320, that aircraft passed above the DC&hyphen;10 on its left and the B747 on the right of its flight path.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) 19 October 1991. A Cessna 441 aircraft was cleared to land on runway 07 which included a requirement to hold short of runway 16 in accordance with SIMOPS procedures. During the landing, both tyres on the main landing gear of the Cessna were punctured and rapidly deflated. The pilot was unable to stop the aircraft prior to runway 16. Two other aircraft were instructed to go around due to the obstructed runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) 16 March 1993. A British Aerospace BAE&hyphen;125&hyphen;1OOOB aircraft was instructed to `Maintain 3000, line up and hold' for runway 16. Shortly after the aerodrome controllers observed the aircraft apparently commencing a take&hyphen;off roll. The aircraft was instructed to stop immediately which was accomplished by taxiway B4. An Airbus A320&hyphen;211 aircraft cleared to land on runway 07, was able to continue its approach and land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) 19 September 1993. During the passage of a thunderstorm, there were several runway changes. A Boeing B737&hyphen;376 aircraft initially taxied for runway 07 then runway 25. On reaching the holding point for runway 25, there was a further change to runway 34. The aircraft was instructed to taxi along runway 25 and hold short of runway 34. The aircraft did not comply with this instruction and crossed runway 34 whilst another Boeing B737&hyphen;476 aircraft was landing on that runway. Both aircraft were permitted to continue as there was no perceived danger of collision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) 24 December 1993. A Piper PA&hyphen;31&hyphen;350 aircraft was cleared to land on runway 07 which included a requirement to hold short of runway 16. During takeoff on runway 16, the pilots of a De Havilland DHC&hyphen;8&hyphen;102 aircraft monitored the Piper which ultimately stopped inside runway 16.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wagga Airport</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) 24 April 1991. An Auster J5 aircraft landed prior to last light without any transmissions due to a radio failure. The aircraft conflicted with a Piper PA&hyphen;32R&hyphen;300 aircraft which was backtracking and a Mitsubishi MU&hyphen;2B&hyphen;35 aircraft on its take off run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Canberra Airport</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g) 12 March 1993. Shortly after a Fokker F28 MK 4000 aircraft was cleared to take&hyphen;off on runway 17, the aircraft was instructed to stop immediately due to a military helicopter, an Aerospatiale AS.350B being slow to cross runway 17 during a landing approach and flare. The Fokker abandoned its take&hyphen;off run at low speed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(h) 25 March 1994. A Cessna 172N aircraft was operating left circuits from runway 12. A Boeing B737&hyphen;376 aircraft was approaching to land on runway 35. On short final, the Cessna had been cleared to make a touch and go landing which included a requirement to not delay passing the runway intersection. The Boeing B737 had been told to expect a late landing clearance. After 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> touchdown, the Cessna did not expedite as requested. The Boeing B737 was cleared to land when approaching the threshold. At this time the Cessna had still not passed the runway intersection. Air Traffic Services reported that just prior to the Boeing B737 passing through the runway intersection, the Cessna overflew the intersection at a height of approximately 50&hyphen;100 feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) 18 November 1994. A Beech 58 aircraft landed on runway 35 while a Cessna 152 aircraft was on approach for crossing runway 12. The pilot of the Beech requested clearance to enter runway 30 from runway 35 but was refused, and told to continue through the intersection without delay. The air traffic controller anticipated the Beech would shortly complete the intersection crossing while continuing on runway 35 and therefore cleared the Cessna for a touch and go landing. The Beech was then observed to enter runway 30. It was too late to send the Cessna around and the controller instructed the pilots of both aircraft to stop. Both aircraft came to a halt about 350 metres apart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adelaide Airport</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(j) 27 April 1995. A Boeing B737&hyphen;376 aircraft initiated a go&hyphen;around manoeuvre due to the proximity of a Fokker F27 MK 100 aircraft that had commenced its take&hyphen;off roll. Subsequent actions by both pilots and Air Traffic Services resulted in a possible infringement of separation standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Essendon Airport</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(k) 11 July 1995. The duty runway at Essendon was runway 35. A Piper PA&hyphen;28&hyphen;161 aircraft was on approach to runway 35 and was number one to land. A Canadair CL600&hyphen;2B16 aircraft was inbound to Essendon via the Plenty Locator. The Canadair had been offered runway 26 with a 15 knot crosswind and the pilot had accepted that runway. The aerodrome controller said that he had advised the Canadair that he was number two to land following a light aircraft (the Piper) landing on runway 35. He said that he later advised the Canadair to expect a late landing clearance. The aerodrome controller said that he gave a landing clearance to the Canadair when the aircraft was on short final (before it had crossed the runway threshold) after he believed that the Piper had crossed the runways intersection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the two aircraft approached the runways intersection, each of the pilots, at the last moment, saw the other's aircraft. Both pilots initiated avoiding action by trying to alter course to the right. The left wing of the Piper collided with the left winglet of the Canadair resulting in substantial damage to those respective areas of the two aircraft. There were no injuries to persons on board and both aircraft taxied clear of the runways without assistance. This accident occurred two

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(l) 10 August 1996. The aerodrome controller forgot to advise the pilot of a Cessna 172RG aircraft to stop short of runway 17 during a landing on runway 26.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr Sharp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. The previous planning for a second airport was based on projections contained in the 1985 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that significantly underestimated the growth in aircraft movements. The median 1985 figures projected around 12 million passengers for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport in 1995. Actual 1995 passenger numbers exceeded 18 million. In 1985, the median projections for 1995 aircraft movements were around 216,000, while actual movements in 1995 exceeded 260,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Demand for air travel to and from the Sydney region is expected to grow strongly for the foreseeable future, particularly from inbound tourists. The Department of Transport and Regional Develop 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment expects aircraft movements in the Sydney region to approximately double by about the year 2010.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) The FAC has developed Sydney Basin forecasts, which have been updated annually, the last public issue being in 1993. Updated forecasts produced by the FAC have not been publicly released in view of the on&hyphen;going airport leasing process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) During 1994 the then Department of Transport provided aircraft and passenger movement projections for the Sydney Basin to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure (HORSCOTI) as part of the `Inquiry into the Sydney 2000 Olympics'. In July 1995, the Department provided similar projections to the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise (SSCAN), and to the Sydney Airport Community Consultative Committee (SACCC).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The projections are currently being updated to reflect the latest available statistical information and will be released in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implications of these projections for the likely use and capacity of the second airport are being examined as part of the airport planning and environmental assessment processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) On 6 November 1996, I announced that the EIS would examine five options, three for Badgerys Creek and two for Holsworthy. These are being examined to assess the full potential of each site as a second Sydney airport. One of the options at Badgerys Creek is within the existing site boundaries and I understand that a 360,000 aircraft movement per annum airport could be constructed, with terminal facilities and associated infrastructure to cater for up to 30 million passengers per annum. Two further options at Badgerys Creek and two options at Holsworthy are being assessed to enable the EIS team to demonstrate clearly the trade&hyphen;offs between the noise, airspace, natural environment, cost and other impacts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) This question is a matter for the Member for Macarthur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Commonwealth ownership of land was one of a number of factors which was considered when the Government decided to include Holsworthy as an alternative in case the environmental impacts of a major airport at Badgerys Creek prove to be unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) A cross runway was included in the initial designs for each of the ten shortlisted sites in the 1985 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). A cross runway was not included in the final design for Badgerys Creek on the basis that the degree of usability was sufficient for an overflow airport of limited capacity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A cross runway has been included in both options that are being assessed at Holsworthy and two of the three options at Badgerys Creek to ensure reliable operations all year round.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr Sharp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows;</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am aware of the support of over 30 NSW rural local government councils for the establishment of an international freight airport at Parkes. However, to date the proposal has not been subject to any rigorous analysis and assessment and the proponents of the project, the Inland Marketing Corporation, have not been able to demonstrate the viability of the concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Parkes is located in a major agricultural production area. It is very well connected to other regions of Australia by rail and road. It is located on the Newell highway, the principal north&hyphen;south road corridor in inland eastern Australia. Addition 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ally, it is on the Sydney&hyphen;Perth national rail line and is a key rail junction for eastern Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The maintenance facilities and infrastructure required to operate an international freight airport would depend on a number of factors, including the type of cargo that will be transported through the airport and the aircraft that will use the airport. The cost of the provision and operation of any such infrastructure would have to be able to be recovered from the users of the facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inland Marketing Corporation, the proponents of an international air freight airport at Parkes, have suggested that the facility would handle some 882 B747 freighter flights into and out of the airport (an average of 2.4 B747 services per day carrying 150,000 tonnes of freight annually) by year 3 of the airport's operations. This is more freight than is currently carried from the combined Australian international gateways other than Sydney and Melbourne and is equal to Melbourne's current performance. The proposed number of flights would be equal to the total number of dedicated freighter services currently operating out of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Department has not undertaken a detailed assessment of the viability of the Inland Marketing Corporation proposal for an international air freight airport at Parkes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inland Marketing Corporation has made a number of submissions and given evidence to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Microeconomic Reform Inquiry into Air Freight Exports on its proposal. However, I am advised that other submissions to the Inquiry have questioned the viability of the proposal due to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the adequacy of existing airports and airline capacity and the unwillingness of airlines and freight forwarders with established infrastructure at other Australian airports to incur additional set up costs at a regional airport; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="113">  </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the inability of a regional airport to service the operating cost of an international facility, let alone the capital costs involved in establishing the facility;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the inability of a regional international airport to deliver lower transport prices and greater capacity for producers than that already offered through the existing gateways;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the inability of a regional international air freight airport to attract the air freight imports necessary to sustain air services; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the inability to attract sufficient supply of produce to justify the provision of dedicated year round air freight capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are matters which the Parliamentary Committee is expected to fully assess and analyse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Parkes is not a designated international airport and is therefore not on the route schedule of any of Australia's bilateral Air Services Agreements. No international airlines have expressed any interest in either operating to Parkes or having Parkes added to any bilateral air service agreement route schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) I have asked the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Microeconomic Reform to conduct an inquiry into Australia's air freight exports. The Committee is specifically investigating the need for, and viability of, additional international aviation infrastructure to meet the needs of regional exporters. The Committee has provided an opportunity for the Inland Marketing Corporation (IMC), which has proposed the development of a freight airport at Parkes, and the many other proponents of inland international airports to have their proposals fully considered and the issues openly canvassed through the Committee's processes.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4V5">Mrs Moylan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The entry contribution system, which has been operating in hostels since 1988 and will be extended to nursing homes from 1 July 1997, does not have an assets test. Entry contributions are negotiated between the resident and the provider, subject to a number of protections, including the provision that the resident must be left with a minimum assets level, currently $22,500, after paying the entry contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The honourable member for Sturt may be referring to the Financially Disadvantaged Persons provisions, which provide a higher subsidy for residents unable to pay entry contributions. These provisions currently define as a Financially Disadvantaged Person, a resident who is a full pensioner and has not owned a home in the previous two years. There is no definition of `home' and the current Hostel Manual uses this term and `house' interchangeably. Evidence about a resident's housing status primarily depends on the resident's statements to the hostel, and it is likely that the treatment of a person who had an interest in a retirement village unit would vary between hostels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Financially Disadvantaged Persons provisions are currently under review by a working group comprising representatives of peak consumer and industry organisations. It is likely that the definition of home ownership will be clarified to include residents who have a financial interest in their residence which is saleable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The honourable member may also be thinking of the Department of Social Security's pension assets test, under which a person is defined as a home&hyphen;owner for pension purposes if they have paid a contribution of over $88,500 towards a retirement village unit. If they have paid a lesser contribution, this amount is treated as a non&hyphen;financial asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Commonwealth will be consulting with State Governments with a view to seeking appropriate changes in state nursing home and hostel licensing regulations in line with the integration of the nursing home and hostel systems under the Residential Aged Care Structural Reform Package. Commonwealth legislation governing nursing homes and hostels will be replaced with new unified legislation covering residential aged care, which is now being drafted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The residential aged care needs&hyphen;based planning formula builds in recognition of changes in population demographics, because it sets a ratio of 100 residential care places per 1,000 people aged seventy and over. Hence, as the population over seventy rises, the number of residential care places will rise proportionately. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="114">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the integration of the nursing home and hostel systems from 1 July 1997, the current separate nursing home and hostel ratios, now 40 and 50 places respectively, will be collapsed into a single residential place ratio of 90 places per 1,000 people over seventy, which with a ratio of 10 Community Aged Care Packages per 1,000, will comprise the needs&hyphen;based planning ratio of 100 places per 1,000 people over seventy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Untrained staff will not be required to perform nursing duties under the new arrangements. The new arrangements will ensure that residential care services meet standards that are acceptable to the community and will encourage facilities to exceed them. In particular, accreditation will require that appropriate care is given by appropriate staff. Hostels now have considerable flexibility to develop their own staffing mix across core and non core duties and with few exceptions use this responsibility suitably. Nursing homes also have the flexibility now to determine the mix of skilled and less skilled core staff. The changes from July 1997, extend to nursing homes the full flexibility now available to hostels by removing the barrier to effective use of staff for both support and personal care tasks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) The single classification scale for residential aged care will be operational from 1 July 1997. The developed instrument should be available from

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently the standard resident contribution for hostels is 85 per cent and for nursing homes 87.5 per cent of the combined pension and rent assistance. From 1 July 1997, the base contribution that hostels can charge will be brought into line with that for nursing homes, as part of the broader alignment of the nursing home and hostel programs. It will not be compulsory for hostels to charge residents the higher base contribution and the additional income raised from hostel residents as a result of this change will be kept by providers and not by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For non&hyphen;pensioners in hostels, the base contribution that can be charged will increase to the same level as for nursing home residents under current arrangements, an amount equivalent to 87.5 per cent of the combined pension and rent assistance. However, a different base contribution will apply for pensioners due to some technical changes to the way rent assistance is paid that will take effect at the same time. These changes will mean that the base contribution for pensioners in hostel and nursing homes will be reduced to 85 per cent of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="121"> pension only and rent assistance payments will be transferred into direct subsidies for providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rent assistance changes will not have any significant effect on income for residents or providers. The reduction in the base contribution will enable residents to maintain at least the level of residual income that nursing home residents currently retain. The direct subsidy, together with the base resident contribution, will allow providers to raise the same level of income as nursing homes do from residents under current arrangements, an amount equivalent to 87.5 per cent of the combined pension and rent assistance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes, nursing homes will retain only a portion of entry contributions and will be required to refund the balance when residents leave. There will be strong incentives for these funds to be used for capital purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current hostel system, providers can retain interest from a contribution plus a retention amount of up to $2,600 a year for a maximum of five years. The retention amounts to apply under the new arrangements will be based on the current hostel system, although the precise detail is still being worked out in consultation with industry and consumer representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes, on a regional basis. The precise details about how financially disadvantaged persons will be defined and how the ratios will work is still being determined in consultation with industry and consumer representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No. The Single Classification Instrument will ensure a better match between funding and care need for all residents. It will be implemented as

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) To date, costs of $9,284, have been paid. They comprise:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Barrister's fees&mdash;No account has been received at this time; (b) Solicitor's fees&mdash;$6,803; (c) Witness and travel fees&mdash;$359; (d) other associated court or legal fees or costs [comprised of medical examination fees ($845) and other disbursements ($477)]&mdash;$1,322; (e) Comcare's internal costs&mdash;approximately $800.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) The Review Services Manager of Comcare's NSW Office made the decision to initially withhold the medical report, based on legal advice from Comcare's solicitor handling Ms Adamthwaite's appeal. Ms Adamthwaite was subsequently provided with the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Tribunal Member presiding at the pre&hyphen;hearing conferences did not invite formal mediation and allowed the matter to proceed to hearing. This was not Comcare's decision to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The decision to appeal to the AAT was Ms Adamthwaite's and, as such, not subject to Comcare's review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Thirty&hyphen;three Comcare claimants have been referred to the doctor used as a witness at the Adamthwaite AAT hearing since October 1995. These referrals were not necessarily in the context of AAT proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) These questions have been answered in relation to the 1994&hyphen;95 financial year, as this provides more complete information because of lead times in finalising cases before the AAT. Approximately 19,400 new claims lodged with Comcare in the 1994&hyphen;95 financial year. Of these:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) 92 per cent were accepted;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) formal AAT&hyphen;directed mediation is rare and figures are not available. In 1994&hyphen;95, less formal mediation, resulting in negotiated settlements, occurred in 32 per cent of Comcare cases appealed to the AAT. This equates to 0.2 per cent of claims received; and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) 0.1 per cent of claims proceeded to AAT hearing and have been finalised.</PARA>
