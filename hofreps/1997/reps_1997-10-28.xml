<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The truth of the matter is that it is a very serious situation, yes. The truth of the matter is that the budgets of the coalition government both last year and this year have created a locked in budget surplus strategy, and it is exactly the right time to have a locked in budget surplus strategy. At the same time, we are paying off some $5 billion of debt. Compare that with the $10 billion deficit that you bequeathed to this government&mdash;and with $100 billion of federal government debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal coalition government has done this country a great service in creating a people's surplus with regard to the fiscal circumstance of Australia just in the nick of time, compared with where we were heading under the previous Labor government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Treasurer, and it follows the last answer. What are the implications for Australia's recent movements in financial markets, and how is our economy placed to respond?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="9919" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. As most people would be aware, the Australian all&hyphen;ordinaries traded sharply down this morning. Around lunchtime it was down about 10 per cent. That followed an overnight fall in Wall Street where the Dow Jones index was down about seven per cent and trading was actually 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9920"> closed. This morning the all&hyphen;ordinaries opened lower, and there was a second wave when the Hong Kong Hang Seng opened later in the morning down eight per cent. Currently, it is about 12 per cent down. Trading in New Zealand was about 12 per cent down over the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, there are massive movements going on in relation to stock exchanges around the world. That situation will be carefully monitored by investors in all different parts of the globe. From the government's point of view, this, along with the developments in South-East Asian currency markets, re-emphasises the importance of attending to the economic fundamentals in the economy. The Australian economy has sound macro-economic fundamentals: low inflation, high productivity growth and high profitability. We have a financial system which is in a very sound position, and we have corporate and household in a very sound position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of lessons can be drawn from the situation we are in now. The first is, of course, how prudent it was to attend to recurring deficits, which this government inherited. There is one thing we could have said&mdash;that is, if the government had not put in place steps to rescue Australia's fiscal position, Australia would be in a far more exposed position today. That is the first point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that being in a situation where we have historically low inflation and, therefore, have avoided the bubble in relation to assets prices has certainly put Australia in a much better position today. I saw that even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said on the wire today, `What you can do is get your domestic economic fundamentals right.' He could actually take some credit for making a correct statement, for once, in relation to this. What are the economic fundamentals that you should get right in order to withstand&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="EVANS" NAMEID="VD4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Growth! Jobs!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard him yell out `growth'. In relation to economic indicators, the most recent edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>  forecasts that Australian growth will be in excess of the following industrial countries: Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. In fact, let's have a guess where Australia comes in the poll: No. 1.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The joke is on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as always. Unable to read a poll, he was caught ignorantly interjecting in this House just when I was about to praise him. The first sensible comment he has made and he could not restrain himself in question time. What an unfortunate character! But let's overlook the unfortunate character. He said&mdash;and he was right, and I was about to say he was right before he ignorantly interjected&mdash;that what a country can and should do in a situation like this is to get the economic fundamentals right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what those economic fundamentals are. The economic fundamentals are fiscal position. The important thing to do at the moment is to get the Australian budget back into balance and to start repaying debt. That is what this government will do. The important thing is to reduce the debt to GDP ratio in the Australian economy, and we have a plan to reduce it to 10 per cent by the year 2000. That is what we will do. The important thing is to ensure that we lock in low inflation in the Australian economy. It is low, and that is what we will do. The important thing is to ensure that we put in place the measures which will guard against the blow&hyphen;out in the current account deficit, and that is principally through boosting savings, and that is what we will do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to international developments, which obviously have global implications, as even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, the most important thing is to attend to the fundamentals. We should never take our eye off the fundamentals, and that is the policy of this government.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Page 11, I am sorry, of the public offer document. It is exactly what I have been saying since the commencement of this process in February of this year&mdash;that is, the Telstra public share offer is on track. What occurs will be determined by market conditions at the time of sale, and that is still some weeks away, and we will be advised by some of the best advisers in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make just a couple of other observations on the question. Firstly, last week we saw the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in here suggesting that we had surplus funds from the sale of Telstra. Surplus! What were we going to do with the surplus? I asked him then in my response what he knew about these surplus funds. I read the speculation daily on this issue as to what the public share offer is going to bring.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me come back to the honourable member for Canberra's question. He said the all ordinaries were down 10 per cent. Of course we are seeing a correction in the global equity markets. We are seeing a correction in the Australian equity markets at the present time, but let us not quote the all ordinaries. Telstra is in the all industrial index, and the all industrial index is significantly above what it was this time last year when this debate was before the parliament. It is significantly above at this very moment what it was at the time we went to the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let me say this very clearly. We are still on track for the Telstra share offer. The government is still monitoring it, I assure you, on a very regular basis as the market goes through this correction. Nevertheless, the decision will be taken based upon the question of the volume, and I can say that, as at this morning, there is significant demand from institutions here in Australia and internationally. The demand is still there. I can say that as at the close of business last night there is significant demand from the retail buyers. I can also say that very few have asked for their applications to be sent back to them at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say also about Telstra that it is just as strong a company today as it was a month ago. It is just as strong, just as solid as it was a month ago, before the correction commenced in respect of the Australia equity market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also say, Mr Speaker, that the government will continue to act responsibly in respect of the sale, and that will, of course, relate to pricing. As we proceed down this track, that pricing will be determined by the prices that are offered in the institutional build&hyphen;up and by the volumes that are being sought. As at this very moment, the demand for Telstra shares is extremely solid. It is a strong, solid Australian company, and we will continue to go down the track of a public share offer, which will, of course, be determined in terms of pricing, et cetera, on, I think, 15 and 16 November. It is still a few weeks away.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recall when this debate started some weeks ago that I was able to illustrate to the House that there has been a 75 per cent reduction in the capital provided to the nursing home sector to meet the demands for upgrading, better quality and the needs of elderly Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You took 75 per cent out over 13 years; you ignored the problem. You received advice from Professor Gregory that we needed to have a new policy construct to deal with this particular issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You were asked the other day how you were going to pay for this issue. The shadow minister, Ms Macklin, the member for Jagajaga, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor is saying that it should be raised through the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How you do it is obviously something that will be worked out in the lead&hyphen;up to the next election. So the Australian public are none the wiser, other than the fact that the Labor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposition, led by the member over here, Mr Beazley, is going to bring in a new taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it was certainly interesting, as I scanned back through some of the contributions to this debate, to find that it was the Labor government who sponsored a major project. It is true to say that the Labor Party has been saying, and I think this is a correct representation of your views, that you see aged care and hospital care as one and the same thing&mdash;I have heard you say this on a number of occasions&mdash;and that you wish to marry the two issues together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recognition of that fact is indeed interesting when you have a look at `Setting the agenda for change', which was a major undertaking that you as a government took when you were in power. What is it that you were going to do to meet the challenges of health care and aged care in this country? You were then talking about residential care facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, when you were looking at the national health strategy, a paper was released, and it posed these fundamental questions: how do we meet this demand; how do we meet these issues? Indeed, if you look at this particular paper called the `The national health strategy: Setting the agenda for change', and open it at the very first page, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Setting the agenda.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is about marrying these two areas together in the future. On the first page, this was the policy advice to the then government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payment for health services should vary according to capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the very centrepiece of what we are arguing. But the interesting thing is this: who was the author of the paper? Who was the person who wrote it? Was it Paul Keating? Was it the then finance minister? No, it was the now shadow minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have had over the last week, and what we had yesterday, is this total and complete misrepresentation. It is an absolute and complete hypocrisy. Your campaign has been all about scaring people. It has not been addressing these fundamental issues. You 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9923"> have stepped away and ignored the advice that you yourselves gave. You stand condemned, and the continuation of your strategy to scare elderly Australians is absolutely shameful.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

If you want to look at customs numbers because you are concerned about the number of customs officers, you might like to reflect on the fact that between 1991 and 1995 the number of people in the customs department declined by over 700. So that is where the downgrading of numbers occurred&mdash;under Labor. It was all under Labor. In New South Wales where Mr Carr is very keen to be critical of the federal government's efforts the police stations in some places are going to open, it seems, between 9 o'clock and 5 o'clock.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr TRUSS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the question is about policing, about detection of drugs. It seems that in New South Wales the drug barons are only allowed to operate between 9 and 5 on weekdays, otherwise there will be nothing found anywhere. But the clear facts are that there has been no reduction in the federal government's commitment to resources in Customs for detecting and intercepting drugs. In fact, the customs department budget has not been reduced, as Mr Carr claimed in the article. In fact, it has gone up. The budget this year is $422 million. Last year it was $403 million. The year before that it was $390 million. Those are the sorts of cuts that I like to see in the budget in my department&mdash;increases each year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, customs resources are being particularly targeted towards areas where they are likely to be of greatest benefit. In the 1996 budget $26 million has been provided over three years for technology specifically to aid in drug detection and interception. The 1997 budget provided the first instalment for an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9926"> upgrading in the customs marine fleet. Of course, there is additional funding also to match increased passenger movements. Customs now has the capacity to undertake surveillance up to 300 nautical miles off the coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, these additional initiatives are achieving real results. We have intercepted more heroin at the border this year than at this time last year. The customs office should be congratulated on its achievements and not condemned by Mr Carr. it would be far better if the Premier of New South Wales were to work cooperatively with Commonwealth and other agencies around the country so that there can be a real national effort on improving our nation's defences against drugs and to ensure that we do what we can to protect the Australian people from the import of heroin and other illicit drugs.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I come back to the history of the trust loss provisions, and I point out to the honourable member for Gellibrand that when they were announced in 1995 they were announced as trust loss measures to prevent trafficking&mdash;that is, when people would go out and find trust losses and offer for consideration the ability to use those losses. That is what it was all about. The legislation that was originally produced obviously went much further. It was put into a Senate committee before the 1996 election and it was found to go much further than was intended or announced.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By everyone. In the 1996 budget the government announced that it would continue with the measure as from the date announced and would put out draft legislation in order to consult. We did put out draft legislation and we consulted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big difference between the 1995 legislation and the legislation which has now gone through the House of Representatives is, as I have stated on a number of occasions, that it enables family trusts that operate businesses to offset losses in the trusts against income in the trading trusts. The classic example is where a family company has a trust which owns a piece of land and another trust which operates the business. If the trust which owns the land generates income and the trust that runs the business generates losses, you would be entitled to set the income off against the loss. Which is obviously right. Which you could do as an individual, which you could do as a company. The big change is that those loss measures could be looked at overall because the income injection test would also apply where income was injected from other family trusts where the beneficiaries were the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that was quite obvious and straightforward. But, if you wanted the absolute conclusive answer to all this, you would, in fact, need look no further than the 1997 budget, because when we released the 1997 budget and we said what the effect of the amended legislation was, if it had opened a loophole it would have had a negative effect on revenues, wouldn't it? You know that. It would have had a negative effect on revenues. But it didn't. See? When it was actually costed it did not show a negative effect on revenues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for McEwen for her question. I am pleased to acknowledge to the House the great amount of work that she puts in in assisting unemployed people in her own electorate and her important role in work for the dole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is engaged, as members will be aware, in a very major historic reform of employment assistance to unemployed people. Of course, this reform comes on the heels of the devastation wrought to the finances of this country and to the morale of unemployed people by the abysmal failure of the programs of the previous government. This government is conducting the largest tender for human services in Australian history: $1.7 billion of public funds are being tendered to provide the services previously provided by the Commonwealth Employment Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to inform the House that the government has had an overwhelming response from the community&mdash;more than 5,000 bids for contracts have been made under this tender from a very wide range of public, private and community organisations. I expect 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9928"> to announce, on behalf of the government, the successful tenderers in February 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new employment market will provide major benefits for job seekers and particularly long&hyphen;term unemployed job seekers. The major purpose of these new services&mdash;this will come as a complete surprise to the other side of the House because they never really contemplated this&mdash;will be to place job seekers in real jobs. That is what the successful contractors will be paid for.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $1.7 billion will be used to provide incentive payments to job placement agencies when a job seeker has been placed in a real job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most expert job seekers in Australia will be contracted to assist the most disadvantaged people in the labour market. As a result of this tender, job seekers will now have access not merely to the 20 per cent of vacancies that have previously been available through the CES but to a much wider range of vacancies advertised throughout the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that alternatives are currently being put to the government's major reform. I informed the House last week of the secret plan put forward by the member for Batman which revives as the Labor Party's major offering to unemployed people in the community the $10 billion disaster of Working Nation. As the member for Batman said, what the Labor Party is about is `active programs . . . as previously implemented under Working Nation.' Members will be aware of the disastrous nature of the Working Nation programs. I remind members of the $500 million spent on the new work opportunities program, which attained a four per cent net success rate at a cost of $144,000 per net job.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot tell the member how pleased I am to have her question. I am responsible in this place for this particular topic. This government has undertaken a number of significant steps and actions to ensure that rural and regional Australians have better, faster and more affordable access to telecommunications services&mdash;nothing could be more important. The Telecommunications Bill, which we passed earlier in this parliament, saw a change from where three carriers were permitted to an arrangement where additional service providers will be able to have access rights to those telecommunications networks, which means that people, upon request, can be supplied with services necessary to enable them to supply their own carrier or content services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major things we did for regional Australia was that we brought forward by three years the effective completion of Telstra's future mode of operation program. The honourable member will be pleased to know that by December 1998 exchanges will be upgraded to allow the supply of digital services to customers and for them to receive 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9933"> a number of enhanced services that they otherwise may not have received unless this change was made. They include call diversion, call waiting and caller line identification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By December 1997, 85 per cent of rural areas will match the services for digital coverage in metropolitan Australia. From July this year, as we know, 93.4 per cent of customers can obtain ISDN services within 90 days of request. That allows businesses and domestic users, particularly many farmers who are vital to our economy, to be able to dial up fast digital connections.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Modeable phones on fax lines will also be important as will faster data transfers and small screen video conferencing.

These Australians will be dependent on analog and radio concentrator services. There is a new program called Telstra's remote Australian telecommunications enhancement program. That will allow for those who are dependent on analog and digital radio concentrator systems to get the benefits of those upgrades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also mention that, for the first time in this country, we have established a program called networking the nation. The first $50 million has been made available for that program. That will allow the redress of longstanding imbalances in the quality of communication services in rural areas. That is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a very significant program. I know that there have been strong representations from rural and regional members&mdash;I might say, on both sides of the House except that, when they were government, they never listened.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that I should make in the remaining few moments is that the government will also ensure that the mobile phone users in the bush are not disadvantaged by the closure of the analog AMPS network. The government will retain some AMPS spectrum in each existing rural plan service area until there is alternative technology available for the delivery of mobile telephony with a reasonable equivalent quality of service and breadth of coverage.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="9934" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Workplace Relations and Small Business" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. I did see those remarks. In fact, I spoke to the shipping industry last week. Firstly, we are very keen to sit down and talk with all the interested parties to work with the shipping industry to benefit the interests of industry generally, which requires an efficient shipping industry for the transport of goods. I did, however, make it quite clear last week that I did not support the idea of the government shelling out taxpayers' money for people just to maintain normal employee relations in their businesses. There is obviously a role for government to play but, when we look at the shipping industry or other industries, they themselves have a responsibility. In fact, it is their first responsibility&mdash;that is, to manage their businesses within the law as efficiently as they can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note by way of contrast an interesting remark in the UK from a Lloyds list dated 14 November. There is a report of the UK government setting up a committee to look at the shipping industry for the UK. The Chamber of Shipping president, Paul Skinner, who is the British counterpart, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This industry deserves support but it deserves support only when it can put its hand on its heart and say it is delivering best of class performance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, in my view, a very good starting point to suggest to the industry in Australia. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> If you look at the industry, I tell you what, there is a lot that needs to be done. We have effectively inherited this industry from the previous Labor administration, and it is not in good shape as the former responsible minister, the member for Gilmore, has said on a number of occasions. The Labor Party had a lot of inquiries into the shipping industry but, I tell you what, they were never capable of providing the leadership to set the industry on a sustainable course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, if you look at shipping numbers you will see that they have been declining. The industry has been deteriorating. People in the industry have spent more time writing submissions for reports to the previous government than they have making profits, which is a big part of the problem. The industry has to address issues of manning. It does need to look at the crew to berth ratios. It also needs to move from the existing industry arrangements and pooled labour arrangements to company employment. We do need a fresh approach to these issues. It is no good looking to the past for solutions when it comes to this industry or, I might say, others. The government is certainly prepared to sit down with industry but industry has to play its part. It has to lift its game when it comes to matching standards elsewhere already achieved by Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Melbourne is my third shadow. I am blessed. I have had two fairly boring ones so far. Now I have a third one. The member for Cunningham did say something about me at one stage. He said what a good report the fair trading response was, and he has been told not to say anything ever again. The member for Canberra cannot think of anything to say, so he does not say much. But the member for Melbourne, he is a veritable treasure&hyphen;trove. He has a lot of important things to say, and good on him for putting them on the public record. Just as a teaser, just as an introduction, he did say that Labor has to move beyond its 1980s love affair with market forces. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, we must avoid becoming economically irrational, lapsing into mindless populism, recycling the policies of the 1950s and defining ourselves by what we don't like. If we adopt such a stance we

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to rise on a matter of privilege under standing order 95. As I mentioned in my statement following the tabling of the report of the Joint Statutory Committee on the Native Title Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund in the House yesterday evening, there were, I believe, three separate incidents of unauthorised disclosure of documents before that committee suggesting a breach of parliamentary privilege involving activities by Senator Nick Bolkus and the member for Banks (Mr Melham) before the report was tabled. Those two committee members briefed the media, boxed copies of the minority report prior to the tabling and held a press conference to discuss and distribute the minority report. I believe that all apparent breaches of privilege are substantially interfering with the work of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to advise the House that I will be raising this matter at the first available opportunity at the next meeting of the committee.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is inexcusable for any government to callously strip benefits away from the people least able to adjust to changed circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal and National Parties believe people in their older years should enjoy peace of mind free from confusion of constant changes in complex rules which even have accountants scratching their heads.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Minister, your party understood the particular vulnerability of older people in 1984. What on earth has happened since? The Prime Minister has this weird notion about mutual obligation. The worst thing I have heard in this debate so far is that the elderly in this country are somehow obliged to keep living up to their side of the bargain. They are not obliged. We are obliged to look after them. We must be obliged to care for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the real impact of this government's changes on families and the elderly, the impact of having to sell their home to get a nursing home bed. In Saturday's Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, we had a very sad story of what it all means to an 88&half;&hyphen;year&hyphen;old woman who, after a 12-week illness, is too frail to remain in the hostel where she has lived for the last 10 years. She must now move to a nursing home to gain the extra care she needs. Her daughter describes in the article what is always a harrowing experience for families, but it is made much worse by the changes introduced on 1 October by the Howard government. The article says:</PARA>

They have not been thanked one bit by anyone on the other side of this House because, of course, they think that they should continue to make sacrifices for us, continue to make sacrifices for the baby boomers, continue to pay until they die. That is not the way we see it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true, Minister, that elderly people are scared. They are terrified that they will have to sell their homes, as was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> on the weekend. It said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9940">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Elderly people are scared. They are terrified they will have to sell their homes to secure a bed in a nursing home. And they are confused.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why are they terrified? They are terrified because it is true: they will have to sell their homes to get a nursing home bed. That is the policy that this government has put in place: people will have to sell their homes to get a nursing home bed. It does not matter what sort of crisis they are in, what condition they are in when they are in a hospital bed, when they are forced to negotiate the size of an entry fee and to sell their homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the country that has been hit by a tidal wave of the aged, it is the aged that have been hit by a tidal wave of information from this government about bonds, fees, fidelity trusts, lump sum equivalents, retention amounts and periodic payments. That is the tidal wave that the elderly have been hit with in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government seems to have misunderstood one critical thing in its bid to charge the elderly for their own care&mdash;that is, the human toll. It is the human toll that this government just does not understand. Let us remind the government of why it is such a human toll. It is the case that people go into nursing homes at a time of crisis&mdash;always at a time of crisis. It is never, ever, a gradual process. Maybe they have had a stroke or maybe they have broken their hip and cannot look after themselves any more at home. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> article further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other doctors complained that it was difficult to get patients into nursing homes because they did not have the cash available to pay the bond and the homes were testing the market to see how much people were prepared to spend.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Liverpool doctor, who did not want to be identified, said he had an 89&hyphen;year&hyphen;old patient suffering dementia who needed to get into a home last week. A local nursing home was prepared to take him, but wanted the man to sign a blank contract agreeing to pay whatever bond the home might later charge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The doctor said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wouldn't let him sign a blank contract so he's still lying in a hospital when he really should be in a nursing home. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what has happened under this government's changes to nursing homes. People are being told to sign blank contracts. People are being told to sign away their homes. People are having to sell their homes when they are in crisis. That is what these changes mean. That is what this government is imposing on the elderly in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact, Minister, even though you will not come clean in question time&mdash;although, of course, your colleagues know it, and they know it only too well. They know that the elderly will have to sell their homes to get into a nursing home bed. They know that people are being faced with blank contracts, without the spaces filled in, about how much they will have to pay to get into a nursing home. Is that fair? Is it fair that they should be faced with these changes? Is it fair that they should be faced with the choice&mdash;as you put it&mdash;of having to sell their home? Is it fair that they should be faced with the choice of having to pay periodically, which is, of course, a total joke because they will lose their pension if they pay periodically? That is the biggest non&hyphen;option I have ever heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the last option? The last option is the best option of all. It is the death duty: pay after you die. That is the third option of this government. What will that mean? It will mean $56,000 out of your estate. That is what it will mean. That is what this government wants to impose on people: sell your home or face a death duty. That is the real choice this government is imposing on people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said, `Let's forget where the obligation lies.' That is what the government has done. The government has forgotten where the obligation is. The obligation is on the government to care for elderly people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech from the opposition spokesman, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), makes a blatant call to emotionalism, and it is not unexpected in the context of the political agenda that is being pursued by the Labor Party. One of the issues the member raised is a point that I can start with&mdash;that is, the story as I heard it related to me by her about the elderly lady in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9941"> Melbourne who is in a hostel and is moving to a nursing home, and that movement is causing a great deal of distress for a range of reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point about this policy is that we are changing the arrangements so that we talk now about residential care facilities, which bring hostels and nursing homes together. Often physically, they will be together. People will be characterised, as they have been previously, but in a much fairer characterisation of 1 to 8 based on their physical position&mdash;with 1 being the highest level of care required, down to 8 being a lesser level of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if this lady is moving from a hostel bed into a nursing home bed, she is moving up the category in the scale. That may not necessarily require a change in status as such, and I think the fundamental point has been missed by the opposition spokesman. Indeed, one might ask whether the lady was asked to make an entry contribution when she went into a hostel, as the existing Labor Party policy was for hostels to ask for an entry contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I come back to the point that I have often said: it is easy to put forward examples, often with a human element to them. I am like any other member in that I would not want anyone to suffer in any way because of the policies of any government. I have always said that, if there are issues that need to be addressed in individual cases, I would do that. I think citing examples in a raised voice and using human emotion&mdash;as occurred recently about the alleged suicides of people&mdash;does nothing to address the fundamental problems of national policy in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Labor opposition spokesman that I do not think that taking this particular tack adds anything to the debate. In fact, I think it diminishes, in the minds of straight&hyphen;thinking people, what the role of the parliament should be: to argue the merits or otherwise of a particular policy position. We have taken a clear policy position with a revamping of the Aged Care Act. We consulted widely on it over a long period of time; it passed this place, and it passed the Senate with the support of the Democrats, led by Mrs Kernot 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at that stage. We knew that we had to address a couple of problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fundamental problem was the rapid decline in the provision of capital to the nursing home sector. That capital diminished rapidly during the governments of Mr Hawke and Mr Keating, to the detriment of aged care. You received advice, and we also received advice, that we had a crisis in the upgrading of nursing homes and that we must attend to it. We came forward with a policy in conjunction with the provider industry and consumers&mdash;all were involved. I think there are about six committees, all of which I have invited to continue the consultation process with me as we go through this implementation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Particular individual management arrangements or particular administrative organisations or issues that emerge from nursing home and hostel practices, now called residential care facilities, will be addressed as we go along. But there will be a broad industry approach to try to get to a position where all of us will be proud of how this policy will be administered because it will address that fundamental problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shortage of capital in the nursing home sector was estimated, back in 1994, by Professor Gregory at about $130 million a year. We know that the provision of Commonwealth funds now to the nursing home sector is very large, and that the increasing demand&mdash;the population avalanche, as some people call it, although I have given it another name&mdash;due to the ageing of the Australian community is a matter that challenges public policy makers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a community, we are contributing&mdash;through residential care subsidies direct to residential care facilities&mdash;$2.6 billion this year, and this will rise to $3.2 billion in the year 2001. The number of 65&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds will double by the time I am 65; I am now 43. The number of 80&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds will double from the year 1991 to the year 2000 as they go into high care required areas. The amount of tax collected is far outstripped by the numbers of people potentially knocking on the door of these residential care facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A system that provides for an upgrading of care, which will redress the equity shortfall 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9942"> and provide us with the infrastructure to house people at a standard of which we can be proud is, I think, vital. I quote the statistics again: 40 per cent of people are in wards of four beds or more; 13 per cent of facilities do not meet fire requirements, and 11 per cent of facilities do not meet health requirements. They are matters that have to be addressed in the national interest. No amount of emotionalism or scare campaigns can hide us from the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On my appointment I took the time to listen to the community, and I listened to the shadow minister as well, much to her surprise. Last week I listened to what she and others had to say, and I presented to my colleagues some proposals for change which we announced yesterday. The proposed changes defer until 1 March the fees to be paid. So people now in homes will not be affected; it will affect people into the future. There will be plenty of time. I think time is needed to explain what is being done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we must remember that 65 per cent of people in homes now will not affected by these fee increases because they are pensioners. The group that will be most affected is self&hyphen;funded retirees in residential care facilities. In Queensland the other day at their national conference they supported this policy. The people that argue against this policy are the Labor Party and a particular ferocious group that I think have misunderstood the fundamental thrust of the policy. When this legislation went through, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We welcome the government's initiatives in responding to the chronic capital underfunding of the residential aged care sector. This was a genuine area of revenue depletion carried over from the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So they recognised this issue. Then they said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now a lot of other people go into hostels and nursing homes to live for a number of years, so it makes sense, if you think about it, if you are moving from one place where you are living to another, to think about selling where you are now to get to the other.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was Francis Sullivan. He has been variously a critic and a supporter, but on this occasion he saw the fundamentals of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy and has lent his support to it. I know that he and others have differences of opinion about particular matters, but they know that the fundamentals that we are addressing here in this parliament are, in terms of the national interest, absolutely vital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said today in question time&mdash;and I will repeat it because the focus of this MPI is on the family home&mdash;`Our package of reforms has always included a number of alternatives to the lodgment of an up&hyphen;front bond and these are particularly important for nursing home residents. These options enable people to pay periodically or, by agreement, to take their accommodation contribution from their estate if that is their preference. These options remain . . . I will listen to other suggestions about how this contribution may be made over coming weeks.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a point about deferment to the estate. There has been an allegation by the shadow minister in her press release yesterday, and today in this debate, that this is tantamount to a death duty. That is an absolute misstatement of fact. A death duty has never been, and never will be, part of this party's policy. Fundamentally, you do not understand what actually happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are agreements between individuals and providers of care. These are agreements that previously existed in the hostel sector. Now, after the announcements of yesterday&mdash;because you realise the absolute integrity and fairness of that policy change that we delivered yesterday to the elderly of Australia&mdash;you have become so desperate that you have run out and made this accusation about death duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A death duty is something that is imposed by a government. It is not what you were alleging. The desperate nature with which you approached this issue was exposed by your press release yesterday, and I have to say that I was frankly surprised about that because I thought there were plenty of other areas in regard to which you could have had legitimate arguments, but you did not choose to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge for the 1990s, as others have said, is all about taking personal responsibility and continuing community obligation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And community contribution. I have already outlined that the contribution made by the Commonwealth is some $2.6 billion. That equates to in the vicinity of $30,000 per year for every nursing home resident on top of the daily contribution to the resident made up to about $36,000 for those needing the highest level of care. That is a very significant amount and those actual forward estimates move up on average by about three per cent per year. There is a continuing contribution made by government, but it is only fair and right that, where people have a demonstrated capacity to contribute, they be asked to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, that has been the feature of other areas of policy, such as education. I saw a transcript today of what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said. When the HECS came in, the then opposition acted responsibly, knowing that we needed to provide more places for young Australians to get their education. We said, `Okay, that's tough. They don't like it on the campuses.' But we know that, in the national interest, that policy was absolutely vital. That is accepted by the education facilities in this country&mdash;by those that provide them and by those that are in them&mdash;because it provides more places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is exactly analogous to what we are looking at here. We need to provide more quality places to an increasing number of aged Australians. It has to be done fairly; it has to be done with hardship provisions; and we have to listen with regard to the implementation process&mdash;all of which I have committed to do. I have put a lot of time into this. I have committed to do those sorts of things and my Prime Minister and my senior colleagues have supported us on this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not going to be deflected from what is necessary in the national interests by a scare campaign by someone who is now desperately running around saying that people are forced to sell the family home. They will not be. You know as well as I do that, if a family gets together and they say to their mum, who is leaving their home and going 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into a residential care facility, `Look, we'd rather keep the home,' they can get together and make the periodic payments if they wish and they can negotiate with the home about those matters. And, if they make that payment, it will not affect mum's pension, if she is in receipt of a pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are issues that need to be explained to people. As I quoted in question time today, the opposition previously indicated that, in this broad area, it believed that user&hyphen;pays fees were sensible; to meet the demands of the future it is a sensible way to go. If you want to continue with this process of scaring people and misinformation because it suits your short&hyphen;term political purposes, let me tell you this: it is all right to make a few quotes from some of the newspapers, but if you read what is being written by those who are writing editorials and some of the think pieces who, ultimately, will have influence on the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day reporting, you will see that they see the sense of what I am arguing for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am quite prepared to suffer the scorn and ridicule of those from the other side and in the broader community. I faced two nursing homes at the weekend in my own electorate of Bass. I went to both of them and, in essence, I gave the speech I am giving now. I talked about the aged issue, I talked about standards, I talked about fairness and I talked about listening and, at the end of that speech, I had people saying, `Okay, Warwick, we know this is hard.' I say this to my colleagues, many of whom have approached me about this matter: if you explain this to people and you do it fairly and carefully, they do understand that we are taking a decision in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to be deflected by blatant emotionalism. I will deal with individual issues fairly, openly and to the best of my ability. But, please, let us have a debate about what we know is necessary for Australia for the future. Aged people need to be venerated. They do not need to become political tools. Those few people in this country who are gathering up behind the Labor standard of scare campaign to make a desperate short&hyphen;term pitch for votes are doing the country great harm but, more particularly, they are

In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aged&hyphen;care groups remain defiant over the October 1 introduction of the "unpalatable" accommodation bonds for nursing home residents.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Michael Isaac, chief executive of Aged Care Queensland representing more than two&hyphen;thirds of the state's aged-care facilities, said the Minister had added "some heart" to the portfolio but had lost ground on accommodation bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The frail aged should not be the only people in Australia whose place of residence counts as an asset. We think it is unfair," he said.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister also quoted Francis Sullivan. I would like to put on the record that I accept that a range of the commentators, of the people who have been talking about the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9945"> changes that have been made over the last 24 hours, have said that this is a step in the right direction. But it is one step. To use the Olympic comparison: it is at least 100 metres in what I suspect is closer to a marathon. I return to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Francis Sullivan, executive director of the Australian Catholic Health Care Association which represents 17,000 nursing home and hostel beds, said while the daily fees had been postponed until next March, it would not add "one dollar" towards care or upgrading facilities unless it was reinvested into the sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Howard Government has caved into public pressure over its aged care reforms with a $60 million backdown on key aspects of the controversial package.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the government remains under fire over its refusal to scrap nursing home bonds, which will force some older people to sell their homes and pay up to $250,000 to enter aged care.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is not us. We have been accused of being the front people, I suppose, for a lot of different organisations over time, but never for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> . The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Australia's Minister for the Ageing, Mr Brown&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I admit that Mr Brown probably has more problems with a number of members on your side of the House than he does with some of us, but the fact is that his criticism is extremely relevant&mdash;slammed the Federal Government for refusing to scrap the bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said it should defer both the introduction of accommodation bonds and fee increases until at least March next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Brown said that unless the bonds were deferred along with the income testing, there would be widespread confusion and concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chief executive officer of Adelaide Central Mission, Mr Stephen Richards, welcomed the four&hyphen;month reprieve on income testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But he also said that the Federal Government had not done enough to address the concerns of the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Government's fine&hyphen;tuning has gone nowhere near far enough for people on low incomes," he said. "It is still leaving people in poverty or locked up in institutions&mdash;this hasn't been addressed by these reforms." 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Another interesting issue is that the minister is endeavouring to take a constructive approach on this issue and saying that he is prepared to look at what might be done. But what is the Prime Minister over there at St Andrew's saying? `No further changes.' That is it. He is over there at CHOGM playing golf and saying, `It's all okay. It's all fine. No further changes are required.' Frankly, once again, he got the Panadol, he got the passport, and off he went.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some might say that the performance of the Howard government in general on this issue has all the hallmarks of a Shakespearian tragedy. I am reminded of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hamlet</EMPHASIS> in many respects. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hamlet</EMPHASIS> is a play that chronicles the demise of the royal family in Denmark. It is a tale of intrigue, betrayal and madness, of great promise reduced to deep despair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see John Howard in the role of Hamlet, a man haunted by the ghosts of his Liberal predecessors&mdash;torn by indecision, racked with guilt, plagued with uncertainty as he watches in horror the inevitable decay of his kingdom. He lives in the past and is unable to  confront the present or even contemplate the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, having been handed the poisoned chalice of this government's aged care reforms, has been put in a tragic and, in some respects, laughable position. How appropriate, then, that he is the character Yorick&mdash;or was that Warwick?&mdash;the court jester, fast becoming a figure of fun, made a fool by his carriage of this government's disastrous meddling in aged care, left to stand alone and foolish before the glance of the media, the parliament and the ire of senior citizens throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As this tragic farce leads on to its inevitable conclusion at the next election, I can see the Prime Minister, bloodied and beaten by the electorate, standing astride the political grave 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9946"> he has dug for the current member for Bass, whereupon he will say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alas, poor Yorick!&mdash;I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is!</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How abhorred, indeed. I could go on. But what should not go on is this government's commitment to these flawed, inequitable and unjust changes to aged care funding. The minister knows, as do all those who sit behind him and retain any empathy with the people they purport to represent, that these so&hyphen;called reforms have been a disaster and will continue to be so, regardless of attempts to fiddle at the edges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They should be scrapped. They should not be reviewed. They should be rejected. However, I suspect that it is fast becoming too late for this minister to be saved. The situation is that this minister, having inherited an absolute mess, is endeavouring to fiddle at the edges to fix it. He seeks to create calm in a situation where calm will not reign, because the fact is that people realise what it is all about. He seeks to fix what cannot be fixed. He seeks to ameliorate a backbench and a ministry who are worried about where it is all ending up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, his political grave has been dug and he has been forced to lie in it. At the next election we will all be able to say, `Alas, poor Warwick, we knew him well.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contribution by the member for Bruce (Mr Griffin) highlights exactly what this is about. He kept referring ahead 18 months&mdash;to the next election. That just shows you the hollowness and shallowness of the Labor Party's attack on these reform packages. I congratulate the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). At least she sounds almost convincing and almost concerned for the aged people that her side of politics left in some of the most disgusting facilities around this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Gregory report in May 1994 estimated that more than half a billion dollars was required to pick up the farce that Labor left behind in the way of aged care accommodation. Just to remind those members opposite, those members in the gallery and those listening on PNN, the sample that the Gregory 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> report undertook showed that 75 per cent of nursing homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet Australian design standards, a problem that needed to be solved; 70 per cent of the homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet Commonwealth outcome standards, a problem that needed to be solved; 13 per cent of the homes did not meet fire authority standards, a problem that needed to be solved; and 39 per cent of the residents were living in rooms with four or more beds, less than desirable and, again, a problem that needed to be solved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was Labor's response? They were content to consign those people to those sorts of conditions while they sat back and withdrew funding from the capital funding programs for aged care accommodation. There was a seventy&hyphen;five per cent reduction in capital funding&mdash;that is what they withdrew from the system. Now they are over there crying crocodile tears and trying to be a tad Shakespearian even though they withdrew that amount of money. They left behind a $10 billion deficit that someone has to pay for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Victoria, a review of aged care facilities has just been concluded: 228 of them did not meet the certification instrument. Throughout the country 327 facilities did not meet the certification instrument. What is Labor's response? To consign aged and frail people to these sorts of facilities while they play opportunistic politics over there. They are not interested in aged people; they are just interested in politics. They think they can play this atmospheric to their advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are talking about separating couples. Under our model, as the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) pointed out earlier, a couple's care needs can be differentiated. Under Labor's arrangement, the husband could be in one facility in a nursing home and the wife could be in a hostel. Occasionally they could organise to get together to meet one another. Under this reform package, those couples need not be separated. That is a humane improvement in response to a problem that has been left to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague and friend the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) is an inspiration to all us for tackling this difficult 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9947"> issue and for talking about the ageing population that we just cannot turn our backs on. We cannot turn our backs on the frail and ageing, the demographic changes and the shambles in some of the facilities that Labor turned their back on. We are not prepared to turn our backs on them. But what is Labor's response? Their response is to conduct a scare campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the coalition has a plan. The average taxpayer funded government contribution to nursing home residents is $30,000, more if there is more care required. That care will be given in their home, which is now an aged care facility. We have new assessment instruments that see that funding levels match care needs so that people with dementia, sensory impairment, multiple disabilities&mdash;high level care needs&mdash;get the funding they need so that they are cared for with dignity in their new home&mdash;an aged care accommodation facility. There is extra funding available for financially disadvantaged people so that they do not miss out. There is good news for many of the 65 per cent of hostel and nursing home residents on full pensions because of the funding changes which have been announced by the minister. There are guaranteed places for those people throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be 135,000 residential aged care places in this country under the coalition government. There will be 2,500 new places every year under the coalition government. Contrast that with the mob over there, who turned their backs on the people with those care needs. We have got new homes for people who are assessed as needing that sort of care. We have allocated $40 million to upgrade facilities in rural and regional Australia where these reforms are not as effective as they will be in urban populated areas. What is Labor's response? In their last year they provided a poopteenth of money&mdash;a few zacks while they stood back and saw the capital stock deteriorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is more, though. The coalition is trying to help these ageing and frail people stay in their own homes. We have expanded the range of services that can assist people to stay in their own homes while still having their care needs fulfilled. We have the nation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> al carers action plan. We have increased our funding to community based support programs. We have put money into the aged care accreditation and quality assurance program to make sure that services and facilities cut the grade. In the 1997&hyphen;98 federal budget, spending on aged and community care was increased by $239 million&mdash;almost a quarter of a billion dollars&mdash;and yet that mob over there is telling us we are pulling money out of the system. The amount is up by a quarter of a billion dollars to $3.73 billion, but we have the policy framework that will deliver sustainable quality care into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people over there are saying, `A little bit of private funding,' to make sure that that goes on top of the additional funding paid for by taxpayers. Those people over there are saying, `That is a bad thing.' What about the care needs of those people, member for Jagajaga? I thought you had a soul. At least the member for Bruce is honest enough to say, `This is pure politics.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When frail and aged people need care they have the opportunity to move from their current home into a new home. That is the point that is lost on everybody. It is okay for the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) to move into the electorate of Batman because moving from one home to another suited his needs. It is all right for Cheryl `Career Move' Kernot to move from her home into another home because that suits her needs. It is all right for people to leave inner Melbourne and come down to my electorate on the Mornington Peninsula so that they can enjoy a better quality of life because that suits their needs. It is all right for people on farms who cannot cope with their farms any longer to move into town because that is the most appropriate choice for them. But, when it comes to the question of people moving from their current home into a nursing home, where there is a large chunk of money&mdash;$3.73 billion&mdash;available to meet their care needs, that is not okay?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something wrong with that, according to those people over there. But it is all right for Martin Ferguson and Cheryl Kernot. It is all right for people who live on a rocky, hilly block to move to a flat place because 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9948"> they are not as agile as the minister sitting at the table. That is okay. But, if people have care needs that require them to go into a new home, a new aged care facility with all the support and funding they could possibly want, there is something wrong with that! You should be ashamed of yourselves for talking down people's opportunity to get the care they need and to make these sorts of transitions. You were only too quick to cheer when Martin Ferguson moved into Batman because it suited him, and you will be only too quick to cheer when Cheryl `Career Move' Kernot ends up wherever she ends up because that suits her as well. That is okay, but it is not okay for these people!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are enhancing the protection of people's current homes. Yesterday, the minister enhanced the provisions for partners and spouses, dependent children, family members who have had some time in the home and carers who have made a contribution towards the care of that person. We have also provided more appropriate gifting provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Labor wants to place everyone's home at risk, everyone in the electorate of Dunkley&mdash;those families who are trying to raise kids and pay for their homes. Labor wants to place their homes at risk. They have no plan to fix this problem, so the aged and frail people's care is placed at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the member for Jagajaga saying, `Let's tax them a bit more,' but what do we end up with? We see more taxes and less disposable income for those families who, right around the country, want to pay for their homes. Labor are saying, `Let's bump up the budget deficit; that would be great. We will do what we did before: we will leave that debt for everybody into the future while people consume those resources today. Why don't we do that?' That is their plan: threatening the homes of everybody else by putting pressure on the finance markets and bumping up interest rates. Their plan is not to fix the problem in aged care accommodation but to place at risk the good folk in Langwarrin, Mornington, Frankston and Seaford&mdash;all those people who want a home as well&mdash;with a tactic that denies the resources to upgrade facilities, puts pressure on interest rates and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bumps up taxes. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Your contribution is to make it harder for home buyers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's plan does nothing to improve the accommodation that is available for people and will deny organisations like the Association for the Blind. I had the great privilege of opening its upgraded 70&hyphen;year&hyphen;old facility at Elanora a weekend or so ago. The people said, `Bruce, gee, we need these reforms because if we can't get these reforms, if we can't get access to some private capital, we can't upgrade these 70-year-old facilities.' They are saying that we must go on with those reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is to be commended for his finetuning. The industry needs to play a more significant role to counter the mischief of those opposite and a few facility providers who are loose cannons in the community. I have talked to the minister about addressing this scurrilous practice adopted by some facility providers who ask the clients, `What is your net worth? We will take $22,500 out of it, and that will be your accommodation bond.' That is disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Centres should be obliged to publish up-front their accommodation bond fees. Families can plan and decide whether they want to pay it up&hyphen;front, whether they want to make a periodic payment or whether they want to defer it to the estate because they have certainty. They do not want some opportunistic behaviour by a very small minority of facility providers trying to extort money out of people who are genuinely concerned about the care of ageing and frail Australians&mdash;just as the people on this side are&mdash;in stark contrast to those opposite and to the Association for Independent Retirees. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes left to me on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R312">Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry Bill 1997</XREF>  and cognate bills, I want to dwell on one aspect which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) does not seem to understand. It is quite clear that the higher charges being imposed on processors, both the AQIS and auditing charges, will impact on growers' prices. In answer to a question which I put to the minister, he said he was advised by the head of AQIS that this would not be the case. It is quite clear that our primary producers are price takers and that any additional cost will impact on the price that they receive&mdash;it is simply unavoidable&mdash;just as the present extortionate prices imposed on the industry by government impact directly on growers' prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear from the government repeatedly about the need for reform on the waterfront. I make it very clear that the costs imposed on the processing industry by government do far more harm to growers than the problems on the wharf. This ought to be recognised by government. While there is no rigour in the system compelling the government to become efficient, because it can simply pass this on to the processor who in turn passes it on to growers, we are not going to see an end to these high costs. What this government is proposing in this legislation simply will not do it. Passing this off to the private sector a la the vision of Hilmer, I suppose, is nonsense. It will not reduce costs to processors and may very well increase costs if they are serious about quality control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is a very important industry for Australia, earning revenue in excess of $3 billion annually. It is a very important industry to rural producers. The benefit to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community is in the smooth running of these facilities and in their taking every possible export opportunity. This ought to be enhanced by government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the best thing the government could do, as I said earlier in my speech, is to pick up the AQIS costs presently imposed on the industry and bear them themselves, thereby giving an incentive to the meat industry to get its health administration right. If the government does this, it will do far more for rural Australia than all the pontification and posturing that we have seen so far.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this debate as I have had experience in the livestock industry and have within my electorate a large number of producers of chicken and poultry meat. I have noted the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), in regard to the role of AQIS and the extent to which the export of Australian produce is dependent upon the clean green image that we seek to give to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the changes introduced by the previous government was to raise some new processes, guidelines and criteria under which our export industry should operate. It was also a requirement of the previous government that not only should those industries meet the full cost over a period of the carrying out of the quarantine and inspection services but also that there should be a change in criteria for judging the significance of particular diseases and/or problems within an industry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R312">Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry Bill 1997</XREF>  and related bills. The romance of the beef industry in Australian culture has no doubt been dampened over past decades as the direct conflicts of greater competition, regionalisation, altering economies of scale, faltering domestic consumption and changing consumer patterns have all had an impact on its growth and profitability. You can also throw into that mix a myriad of other factors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, there is the drought, and the drought has continually dogged the industry sector in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9952"> recent years, depressing prices and reducing the nation's herd size. The Hunter's prime beef cattle districts of Gloucester, Dungog, Maitland and Bulahdelah have not been immune from the impact of El Nino. Secondly, there is the area of food hygiene. Food hygiene has become very much a hot household issue of the 1990s, and it is a phenomenon that crosses the planet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world's first truly global food safety scare last year was the BSC, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, outbreak&mdash;more commonly known as mad cow disease&mdash;which resulted in an immediate collapse in world beef consumption. Figures ranged from 10 to 50 per cent in consumption falls across Europe and 20 per cent in north Asia whilst, inadvertently, the Australian market suffered an estimated five per cent decline, despite our total removal and link from the disease outbreak. A very much still depressed domestic marketplace and associated low beef prices continue to be reflected in official data. ABARE forecasts for beef producers during 1996-97 predicted, and have been found to be true, that prices would remain low, with producer profitability levels slim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, and of current long-term concern, beef as a product continues to face staunch and growing competition from poultry and other meat products. By the year 2005, Australia will, for the first time, be estimated to consume more chicken produce as a nation than beef. That is a significant fact and one that the red meat industry unquestionably must come to terms with. Put simply, they are losing market share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the determination of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, and this government to provide legislative framework encompassed within this bill will create new company structures and operational arrangements for the Australian red meat and livestock industry and advance the industry towards managing its own affairs. It is issues like the explosion in growth in poultry consumption that in one small but significant way highlights the need to press on and deliver these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consumption level of poultry and white meat is escalating. Last year each Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consumed an estimated 28 kilograms of chicken, up from 25 kilograms per person in 1993. Leading industry figures confirmed this rapid rate of growth in chicken consumption, pointing out an 11 per cent rise over the past four years. Around 350 million chickens are now consumed annually in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as significantly, North and South-East Asian nations are similarly experiencing rapid growth and enthusiasm for poultry products, with demand outstripping domestic supply. The effective impact on such markets recognised for their high consumption of Australian beef will therefore need to be carefully assessed. The changing face of the consumer market for meat further vindicates my passionate fight to sustain the Australian chicken industry's profitability, its sustainability and its prospects for export growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The feared impact of possible imported cooked chicken meat products from Thailand, Denmark and the United States that inadvertently may introduce virulent exotic diseases to our local poultry sector, along with our native fauna, is a risk I have repeatedly mentioned, and I hope the science of the matter may hopefully vindicate that as being a risk too great to accept. What we do not need in Australia is a poultry version of the mad cow disease, destroying consumer confidence on a domestic market and removing export opportunities from a clean green food bowl to Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand Minister Anderson will be making an announcement pertaining to the final scientific results of independent testing and reassessment, which he ordered to be undertaken back in January this year, in the very near future. Like the rest of the Hunter's chicken industry&mdash;including all broiler growers, workers, consumers and the broader public&mdash;I await with bated breath the outcomes of these final scientific results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My fight and the local chicken industry's fight to get the science right is about to reach its nadir. On reflecting on the state of the beef industry, the tag still very much being applied to the sector by so many players is that the industry remains in some sort of crisis. Nevertheless, there is still no doubting the beef industry's overall significance to both the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9953"> national economic make&hyphen;up and the regional economy of the Hunter. Australia, of course, remains the world's largest beef exporter, with more than 60 per cent of local production going offshore. In beef and veal sales alone, these exports netted $2.4 billion in 1995&hyphen;96 and an estimated $2.1 billion in 1996&hyphen;97. As a single agricultural export earner, red meat and livestock rank third after wheat and wool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A most significant feature of the changing face of the Australian beef industry is the spectacular growth of live cattle exports against an economic environment affected by drought and low prices. In 1991, as a nation, we exported 90,000 head of live cattle. Last year that figure was half a million, representing 10 per cent of total exports. Despite the recent flood of American beef on the world markets, spurred by booming US production levels that between 1993 and 1995 increased by some 950,000 tonnes, our exports as a percentage of total national beef production have actually increased in the process&mdash;from 40 per cent of total local beef production to, within the past four years, well over 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reform agenda within this legislation will, I believe, very much assist the meat industry in Australia move towards self&hyphen;regulation, develop more free market operations and more strategic alliances, deliver more savings in changing the structures and levy funded functions, and hopefully deliver more competitive advantages that translate into greater exports, a greater share of the world market and a greater net return on investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the beef sector in the Hunter, the legislative reform agenda will similarly have an important overriding impact, but it is important to reflect that the state of the domestic industry within greater New South Wales, and indeed the Hunter, has changed dramatically. Far removed from the sprawling cattle stations in north Australia, on my own patch within the lower Hunter small cattle properties carrying a relatively small number of cattle are very much the norm. Whilst New South Wales has 27 per cent of the nation's total producers, it presently carries only 19 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent of the national herd with many producers running less than 300 head. The state of the Hunter beef sector reflects that fact, with many producers running such holdings and hence facing the fuller brunt of cost pressures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a regular attendee of the New South Wales Cattlemen's Council Gloucester branch meetings, and with continued contact through the saleyards with people such as Gloucester based Jim Henderson and Peter Green, from the Maitland saleyards John Lidbury and up at the Dungog saleyards, Paddy Dillon, I always try to keep abreast of the industry's fluctuating fortunes. Recently I had discussions with Rear Admiral Peter Sinclair, the former Governor of New South Wales, about his local holding of numerous head of cattle on his property in the Tea Gardens&hyphen;Hawks Nest area, which is an example of the operative local growers across the Hunter. Our discussion focused on the investment required to establish and maintain a prime beef property and the narrow returns that come from the low sale prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for producers to know and to understand that the establishment of the red meat service delivery company to replace the statutory trifecta of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the Meat Industry Council and the Meat Research Corporation will, despite some admitted apprehension by sectors of the industry, help drive industry development. It will help drive competitiveness and innovation of the industry into the future. Its impact on both small and larger growers alike will, nevertheless, be significant. It is a point that has been reinforced within the red meat industry sector proper. As Rick Wright of the New South Wales Farmers Federation quite correctly stated in his response to Minister Anderson's recent announcement of the make&hyphen;up of the board of the new red meat organisation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Traditionally we have looked to bodies such as the AMLC to make decisions for us, then we have blamed those bodies when the industry experiences downturns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now organisations such as the Cattle Council and the Sheepmeat Council must take responsibility for setting broad industry directions and policy which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9954"> will then be implemented by the new red meat organisation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Innovation for the beef sector, however, must go and is going beyond these legislated changes solely intended to provide producers, processors and exporters with more ownership and, as a consequence, accountability for their own industry. It is also aimed at taking further regulatory brakes of government off the meat industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Traditionally, and unbeknown to many, the beef sector has been the least regulated at the federal level of all Australia's major agriculture industries. An example of that new innovation is reflected in the case of Gloucester Gourmet Foods Co&hyphen;operative Ltd, trading by the name of Barrington Beef. Gloucester Gourmet Foods was established as a concept in June last year following a beef crisis meeting held in Stroud with Hunter beef growers. As a cooperative, it was formed in April 1997. Gloucester Gourmet Foods specially selects stock from 30 local Gloucester producers which are then slaughtered at the Frederickton abattoir near Kempsey. Following along the chain, Darrel's Gourmet Butchery in Gloucester undertakes boning and packaging to ensure effective quality control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcome to date has been the successful marketing of Barrington beef as gourmet quality prime beef exemplifying the character traits that customers are looking for&mdash;traits of high consistent quality, professionally pre&hyphen;packaged and tailor made to the customer's own desire throughout the Sydney, Central Coast and Greater Hunter regions. Perhaps our very own parliamentary dining room should put on the menu what is arguably the very best beef available for all of our colleagues to try. Barrington Beef is driven by Gloucester residents, the chairman being David Lawrie and the financial director, Colin Ware.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This concept has captured the imagination and notice of many people including Minister Anderson during his visit to Gloucester in September, as well as the newly elected Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries, Senator Troeth, and respected regionally based Senator Bill Heffernan, during their meeting with the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cooperative in August. More to the point, Barrington Beef is taking an innovative step towards brand name marketing of quality local beef from the Gloucester district in the Hunter which is antibiotic free, chemical residue free, hormone growth promotants free and pesticide residue free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Barrington Beef product is delivered in bulk quantity direct to the customer's door, cut the way the customer likes it, is suitably priced and prepared either for the freezer or the dining table. Selected niche marketing of Barrington beef specifically to the north shore Sydney market has already reaped, in value added terms, around $100,000 in fresh cash flow for the Gloucester community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, produce heading the way of Gloucester Gourmet Foods, whilst it has only half the beef producers at present under its banner, is likely to include boergoat and rabbit farming. As I am led to believe, the medium&hyphen;term future for the cooperative is to seek a possible shopfront retail outlet on Sydney's north shore to further promote the product and carry the organisation's growth onwards and upwards in exposure and profitability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, my general concerns within the local beef sector are based very much on the continued difficulties that local growers have to go through to make a substantial return at the farm gate. I think that what we need to address is the vertical integration of the beef industry here in Australia. From the time that the beef is bought at the sale yards, goes through the producer, goes through the distribution company, gets exported and ends up on someone's dinner plate overseas, there is a substantial price change, but that price change is not reflected back through to our local beef producers. Indeed, our producers are now getting, over the last three or four years, the lowest price they have ever achieved for some of the best beef that they have ever produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said to me that one of the reasons for this is perhaps collusive buying at the markets. There is also the fact that our processors are in fact overseas owned. The meat goes through to the abattoirs which are overseas owned, and it is prepared and packaged for distribution overseas by overseas 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9955"> companies who run it all at very little to no profit, and indeed in some cases at a loss. That beef is then shipped overseas to another company which is in the same chain at, yet again, a loss. Then it is on&hyphen;sold again to a distributor at a loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That seems to avoid a lot of the anti&hyphen;dumping regulations for cheap beef prices, and it escapes any controls that way, but amazingly when it goes that one step before it hits the final retail sales there is a massive price jump which sees beef which goes from, roughly, $2 to $2.50 per kilogram dead weight here in Australia to $20 to $25 a kilogram in some of the Asian markets. That is not considered to be fair and equitable and it is something which needs to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key element in the very successful vertical integration from the farm gate to overseas dinner plates relies on effective and efficient management of our waterfront. The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) made claims in this House yesterday, when debating this bill, that the waterfront is apparently not a problem. It may not be a problem for him and it may not be a problem for the live export market that he spoke about, but when it comes to refrigerated containers going out of Australia full of beef it is a very big problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than getting hairy chested about all of the rhetoric on the waterfront, let us stick to the clear facts. According to the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, as my colleague the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) recently outlined to the House, the world waterfront productivity benchmark is 25 crane lifts per hour. Yet our five main ports in Australia average just 17.4. In Sydney, the rate has been monitored and assessed to be as low as 14 per hour, whereas the port of Auckland averages 24.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you think of frozen beef exports, this substantially adds to the bottom line cost. Australia contributes but two per cent to the world's sea trade, yet now our local waterfront contributes to 24 per cent of the world's waterfront disputations. Classical disparities in the system remain, such as that it is cheaper to ship from Los Angeles to Indonesia than it is from Sydney to Indonesia. To continue 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the export drive for our beef, we need to remain competitive, but the drive down in price should not, and must not, be at the farm gate. We need to ensure that we have the most competitive transportation costs and the most competitive processing costs&mdash;to match our spectacularly low priced beef&mdash;to maintain our market share.</PARA></SPEECH>

I would suggest he wash down his fine Barrington beef with a drop of Bloodwood, Canobolas Smith, Highland Heritage or any of the other fine wines from the Orange district. It would be a great combination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As other speakers have already outlined, the Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry Bill 1997 and the associated bills completely change the face of the industry and its structure. The new arrangements are a major step forward, giving the industry responsibility for managing its own affairs&mdash;a move that will hopefully further increase efficiency and competitiveness and allow Australia to retain its position as one of the world's leading meat producers and exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us representing rural electorates know only too well how tough farmers have had it over many years now, and none more so perhaps than beef producers over the past few years. It is interesting when you hear unionists talk of minimum wages for employees to remember that many farmers, and particularly beef producers, have been forced to survive and raise families on incomes well below so-called minimum wages. The scarcity of money among farming families also impacts on rural communities, depressing the economies of those country towns, which I do not need to detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time our producers are constantly told, and they know, that they are among the most efficient in the world. They see the sorts of prices being charged in supermarkets here and overseas and they wonder who on earth is making all the money, because the prices they are being paid seem to be a very small fraction of the final retail price.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9956">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The image paddock to plate evokes a chain of benefits to all the economy but, sadly, Australian producers garner their small reward not much beyond the paddock gate. Hopefully, this series of bills goes some way towards addressing that particular problem. Beef and lamb producers in this country have suffered far too long as money, which should be returned to them, has instead been creamed off to pay for inefficient abattoirs, an inefficient inspection system, inefficient ports&mdash;as the member for Paterson alluded to&mdash;and a cumbersome industry management and promotion structure. I am pleased that this government has gone a long way towards addressing many of these problems through legislation such as workplace reforms and it plans to go a lot further to help reduce ridiculously high inspection and port charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly a desire by rural voters to see a return to more profitable levels in key agricultural sectors, such as the beef industry, was one of the major factors behind voter disenchantment and the huge swing experienced at the last federal election in regional seats. The international price collapse brought on by the British mad cow disease scare in 1995, coupled with the lingering drought in Queensland and northern New South Wales, which is still lingering on the horizon, brought many to the conclusion that change had to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While welcoming the thrust of these reforms, I would say that some of the criticism of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation in recent years has been unwarranted and that it was often made a scapegoat for factors well outside its control. As an organisation, it has some excellent staff who have done a magnificent job in promoting meat to consumers and representing Australia's trade interests overseas, but there is little doubt in my mind that the industry structure that was in place was unnecessarily complex, cumbersome and somewhat unaccountable. I am sure that many producers did not even understand the relationship between the Meat Industry Council, the AMLC and the Meat Research Corporation and how each body worked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that this series of bills will result in a management structure which can deliver more flexible outcomes and focuses on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commercial programs and operations. That surely will be a step in the right direction. I congratulate the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) for his decision to back away from controversial plans to force abattoirs to pay the full cost of meat inspection. That particular proposal would have had a major impact on abattoirs which are major employers in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I understand the government's wish for cost recovery, I believe the minister has made the right decision in bringing in the policy gradually as abattoirs enjoy the benefits of various other reforms which will minimise the impact of the higher fees. In fact, so far out of kilter was this particular policy that, in an emerging industry, the venison industry, there was very little prospect of a new meat works getting up and running at Oberon such was the impost of these proposed fees. I am glad to see that that particular sector of the red meat industry has been accounted for in the changes the minister has made, and I thank him for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have reservations, like the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), about the emphasis on self&hyphen;management in the industry. We need consistency in our quarantine inspection system which only a national system like that of the US with the government picking up the tab can deliver. But we need an efficient system without the featherbedding that exists in the current regime. If we cannot achieve that efficiency with our current union and management structures, then perhaps self-management is the only way to go. But that is fraught with risks to our entire meat industry because of the reliance on uniform standards being maintained by diverse interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that, despite the concerns of the cattlemen's union over the failure to separate beef and sheepmeat industries into separate administrative bodies, I have received no complaints from producers within my electorate on this score. Indeed, as the minister says, there are stronger reasons for maintaining a multispecies body than there are for a split. The minister has detailed the cooperation in joint research and development projects and the financial and other efficiencies that would flow from coordinating efforts in market 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9957"> access, market intelligence, quality assurance grading and administration. The minister has emphasised the need for a proper grading system for red meat, beef or sheep, to ensure producers get exactly what they want when purchasing meat. A multispecies body overseeing this laudable goal strikes me as eminently sensible. This should, in my view, be one of the major priorities for the new industry body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received some critical comment from the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders over the Live&hyphen;stock Transactions Levy Bill, which is part of this group of bills under debate. As honourable members know, this provides for levies payable by producers on transactions involving sheep, lambs and goats and replaces the livestock slaughter levy. The money will be used to fund the new industry service delivery company, disease eradication and animal health for the sheepmeat, wool and goat industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sheepmeat Council of Australia and the Wool Council of Australia have both supported this change of levy tack. The stud merino breeders group disagrees claiming the Sheepmeat Council and the Wool Council now represent less than 30 per cent of Australian sheep producers. The stud merino breeders group believes the proposed legislation will lead to collection of up to 67c per head on mutton and $1.42 per head on lamb. It does disturb me that this merino breeders group believes the transaction levy has been both underestimated in its impact and promoted by peak bodies out of touch with rank and file producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from one letter that I believe has been sent to all rural members, I have not heard of any similar complaints about this transaction levy&mdash;that was until the shadow minister spoke last night of a wad of complaints received in his office. I heard too the comments from the member for Kalgoorlie and his lack of confidence in peak bodies to deliver any meaningful benefits to their members. In fact, as the stud merino breeders group says, they failed to represent members' interests. Given the growth of the agro&hyphen;political industry over the past 20 years and the questionable agenda adopted by some peak 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> organisations, I can certainly relate to those sentiments. But others with close connections with the meat industry tell me they are supportive of these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned, however, at the need for the government to take these bills to a Senate committee, as alluded to by the shadow minister last night in this place, and for that committee to discuss industry unrest over this particular legislation. It really does make me wonder what industry consultation has in fact taken place despite the 12 principles contained in the reforms. It makes me wonder how confident the government is about its legislation. I wonder why such committee considerations do not take place before we in this House debate the bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I support the overall thrust of the bills, I must put on record my concerns at the points raised by the merino breeders group and those other groups and individuals alluded to by other speakers during this debate. However, while the member for Kalgoorlie argues for a levy on a kill basis or a per kilo basis rather than a transaction levy because, as he says, many breeding sheep will never see an abattoir, there are huge benefits to the merino industry from wool industry research that will be funded from these transaction levies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point to the current debate within the merino industry over funding of an eradication program for Ovine Johnes disease. We are not in a position for industry to fund this OJD eradication program without a substantial injection of federal funding. Hopefully, that will be forthcoming on a 25 per cent state and federal basis and a 50 per cent industry basis. However, a fairly implemented transaction levy would appear to me to raise the necessary funds on a long-term basis needed to tackle the challenges posed by diseases such as Ovine Johnes disease, certainly not in enough time to attack the Ovine Johnes problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to get that federal support, state support and industry support guaranteed and in place before the commencement of this summer, otherwise we lose that window of opportunity for a two&hyphen;summer break on the property, after which time producers can 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9958"> restock their properties. If we lose another 12 months, we will see a further spread of this insidious disease beyond the borders it is now suspected of being contained in. It has broken out in some other states, but the trace backs, as far as I can gather, have brought the problem right back into the tablelands region of New South Wales. That is the area we have to attack, and we have to attack it with a separate funding process, not through this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ovine Johnes disease has long-term ramifications for the sheepmeat export industry as well. So the red meat industry is at risk if we allow this disease to linger, spread and get to the proportions of the 15 per cent infection of flocks that occur in New Zealand&mdash;a country which happens to believe, I think, that a level playing field is one infected by every disease under the sun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must be in a position with the challenges and drawbacks posed by freer international trade to meet the disease and animal health dramas that will inevitably confront us, rather than dilly-dallying and arguing about where we can access the required funds. In short, we need an insurance premium and a fund for all contingencies. This transaction levy would seem to me to meet that need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say, though, that the industry would require far more stringent guarantees that research and development funds under this industry restructuring are much more accountable than appears the case in the past. I refer to the ill-fated Future-tech project that the member for Kalgoorlie alluded to last night which, according to ANAO's report, lacked research vigour, had unqualified costs and benefits and ill-defined market potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From an initial estimate of $1.5 million in 1989&mdash;that is a Meat Research Corporation figure&mdash;the cost of Future-tech blew out to more than $20 million. Those are the official figures when it shut down in 1994. I am led to believe that figure could be closer to $40 million. There are grave concerns about the fate of any future research levies from producers given the sad Future-tech tale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen in recent days the sudden decline in our export of live cattle to South-East Asia brought about by the economic and, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more particularly, the currency crises that have hit several of our key trading customers. There is no doubt we must be as flexible as possible to accommodate sudden changes in a our market fortunes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, our meat producers, particularly cattle, have done it extremely tough in recent years. The margins have been minimal, if at all. One great concern is the vertical integration of the cattle industry with foreign control of meat processing further reducing any value added benefit to local producers or processors from the product. As the member for Kalgoorlie again pointed out in his speech on this bill, three of our abattoirs&mdash;one American, one Japanese and one Chinese owned&mdash;account for 20 per cent of all our exports. As in so many of our primary industries, we are price takers when, with further local ownership and control of the production and supply chain, we could derive much more deserved profit from our endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in order to maximise what returns we do have remaining, there must be consensus, coordination, cooperation and corporate control with the industry, not government, dictating these goals. This requires the sort of streamlining of the meat and livestock industry built into these bills. As in the case of the abattoir inspection charges, we can continue to debate and, where necessary, finetune the detail, but we must, as the scout motto says, be prepared whether in funding research, seeking and accessing markets, and promoting clearly identifiable and consistent products. These bills, I believe, provide those disciplines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am aware of the concerns from some sectors of the industry and, while I am prepared to give these bills my support at this stage of their progress, I will be monitoring the Senate committee's deliberations closely. I expect there will be some significant amendments in the Senate if producers' views turn out to be in conflict with the views expressed by the government and the minister in presenting this bill; namely, that extensive consultation and agreement has been achieved in formulating these changes. That appears to be in some doubt.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9959">
<PARA STYLE="Other">Mr BRUCE SCOTT  (Maranoa&mdash;Minister for Veterans' Affairs) (4.58 p.m.)&mdash;I thank members from both sides of the House for their contribution on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R312">Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry Bill 1997</XREF>  and associated legislation. I think it demonstrates the interest that there is in our great primary industries of this nation and the important role that primary industry plays not only in Australia generally but also, very importantly, in regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the  Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry Bill 1997  and associated bills is to provide a legislative framework which is to underpin the move by industry from statutory to new company structures and operational arrangements which will subsequently lead to greater self-determination by the industry. This move to self-management and empowerment is at the request of industry and is a major step forward, advancing industry towards greater management of its own affairs, establishing its strategic directions and developing industry specific policy. It also demonstrates the ongoing government commitment to industry through levy collection arrangements, R&amp;D expenditure matching and DPIE management of existing AMLC export licences, export quotas and enforcement powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Corporations Law will underpin accountability arrangements of the new company structures with Commonwealth deeds of grant to provide added assurances to levy payers. These changes will empower industry and significantly reduce government involvement and will provide a more responsive structure capable of adapting to rapidly evolving market competition and customer needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Implementation of these new arrangements is well under way with full cooperation from industry leaders. It is expected that there will be a reduction in the current levels of expenditure on marketing and promotion and research and development activities which are provided by the new service delivery company, Meat and Livestock Australia Ltd&mdash;that is, MLA. These reductions will not be arbitrary; they will be achieved by improved administrative efficiency and a more precise focus on industry needs. Negotiations on levels of funding are under way and will not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be finalised until all sectors come to agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to industry progressing to the new arrangements, it must clearly demonstrate to the minister that all goals of the meat industry strategic plan will be delivered against the new arrangements and that forward three&hyphen;year work programs clearly meet whole of industry interests. Furthermore, it is becoming apparent that, in the main, industry has determined the broadly generic marketing campaigns are not serving its interests as well as they might and that there is a clear preference from some sectors to move towards branded product marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also clearly supports the development of value enhancing technologies developed through research and development. Under the new arrangements, industry will still be able to attract Commonwealth matching funding on eligible research and development expenditure. Although research and development expenditure may be reduced initially through the careful and close scrutiny of existing programs by industry, it is expected that the remaining programs will be more focused on meeting stakeholders' requirements. Again, R&amp;D programs must meet the goals of the meat industry strategic plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of major concern to the government and the new industry companies is the uncertainty that these new arrangements are having on existing staff of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the Meat Research Corporation and the Meat Industry Council. It is a priority to provide fair and equitable treatment to these staff members, many of whom are seen to be a valuable asset to the success of these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerns raised regarding clause 45 in the repeals and consequential provisions bill 1997 are ill founded. Clause 45&mdash;that is, `Certain staff members taken to have resigned'&mdash;provides that an employee is not entitled to both a redundancy package and an equivalent or better job within the new structure. The clause deals with employees who are offered employment in the new organisation but do not accept it. Unless it is shown that the terms and conditions of the new employment taken as a whole are less than those enjoyed in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9960"> existing employment, that person will be deemed to have resigned. This would prevent a person refusing an equivalent offer of employment in order to take a redundancy payment and, after receipt of the redundancy, accepting employment within the new structure. Certain taxation provisions also relate to the tax treatment of redundancy payments in such circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision protects the right of employees and provides for both an independent decision on equivalence and a right to review under the ADJR. A staff member who does not receive an offer at least equivalent to current terms and conditions will not be disadvantaged by this provision. It also protects industry moneys which are taxes, ensuring an independent approach to such matters. It further allows industry to keep key staff essential to industry function performance&mdash;precedents include sections of the Moomba&hyphen;Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994, the Repatriation Institutions (Transfer) Act 1992 and the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Act 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal bill provides for operation of the new arrangements including continuation of export licensing and quota management functions transferred to DPIE with full industry agreement, recognition of the Corporations Law companies performing industry tasks or representing industry, flow of levies and Commonwealth R&amp;D matching payments to the new companies and continuation of the provision for ministerial direction but only in situations of emergency and where the national interest is involved in areas where the Commonwealth has authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The repeals and consequential provisions bill provides for associated legislative changes and all the other necessary authorities to enable the new arrangements to commence, including provisions to repeal or amend relevant parts of the effective arrangements and transfer accumulated assets and liabilities to the new industry structures with provisions for necessary accountability and provisions to protect existing staff entitlements for the transfer. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The remaining 15 bills all deal with industry levies, reflecting the wishes of the processing and livestock export sectors to implement alternative collection arrangements but to maintain underlying levy legislation for the time being. As a consequence, they rearrange levies for clear sectorial differentiation and implement other changes requested by industry, in particular the move of sheep and lamb produce levies to a transaction basis. All these changes are being implemented following detailed studies and extensive consultation with all industry stakeholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that there has not been total industry agreement on the  Live&hyphen;stock Transactions Levy Bill 1997 &mdash;sheep, lambs and goats. This bill provides for the introduction of a transaction levy for the sheepmeat and goat industries in lieu of the previously proposed slaughter or `pass&hyphen;back' levy. This was done at the request of the Sheepmeat Council of Australia. The main opposition to the bill comes from the stud merino breeders, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association in Western Australia and other small representative groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In aggregate, the opposition to this bill was far less than the support shown by those groups and associations representing sheepmeat and wool producers nationally. The Sheepmeat Council of Australia demonstrated that the proposal had majority industry support, including from the Wool Council of Australia, the Goat Industry Council of Australia and also from the Australian Poll Dorset Association, the Australian Corriedale Association, the Australian Texel Stud Breeders Association and the states' major farming associations. The prospective collection agents&mdash;the Australian Meat Council, the National Meat Association of Australia and the Australian Council of Livestock Agents&mdash;also support these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The status quo cannot be maintained for livestock collections as the processors who currently pay these levies are to go to non&hyphen;statutory collection arrangements. The legislation will impose a levy on all transactions involving sheep, lambs and goats, with a regulation providing for an exemption for those sold for less than $5 per head.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9961">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government rejects the claim that there has not been full consultation, and further rejects the claim that levy principles have not been adhered to, because we have listened to the clear majority view. It is important to note that the proposed legislation provides for future decisions on exemptions to be implemented by regulation, provided these proposers of the exemptions demonstrate adherence to the government's levy principles, including transparency, equity, and administrative efficiency and effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the bill has been referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. It is important that this bill proceed to the Senate as part of the total meat reform package of bills. Any other approach opens up the real risk of future delays or of the sheepmeat industry being deprived of funding when existing levies are repealed. Any recommendations arising from the Senate committee hearing can be dealt with as part of the Senate consideration of this legislative package.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation was introduced into this House only last Thursday. As a result, it has been absolutely impossible for the opposition to fully analyse the provisions prior to this debate. Nor have we been able to consult with interested stakeholders&mdash;which is simply not good enough and clearly an unreasonable position for the opposition to have been put into.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has been extremely cooperative in supporting the prompt passage of legislation, but the government is abusing our good faith with its unreasonable demands. In the last few months we have put through with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> absolute cooperation a huge amount of legislation concerning taxation. The very complex safety net arrangements were passed without delay, despite the botching of the implementation process, when we found the High Court striking out the state governments' business franchise fees on petrol, alcohol and tobacco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two more amending bills were passed on that front by the Senate yesterday. Indeed, another package implementing further changes to the arrangements for tobacco is up for debate tomorrow. We have been cooperative in getting that legislation through. We have had virtually no time to consider the complex package fixing up the mess of the superannuation surcharge tax. Once again, however, we cooperated, giving that legislation speedy passage to enable the Senate committee to consider the measures in that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also dealt with the trust loss measures expeditiously. Even though we had been waiting for 18 months for the government to bring on the legislation, we said, `Fine. We'll deal with that bill quickly as well.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had numerous other omnibus taxation bills through this year, including four prior to this one plus legislation concerned with tightening up the taxation of foreign source income. The more cooperative we get, the more unreasonable the government gets. For all that cooperation we now have the government demanding that legislation be dealt with in the minimum possible time frame. There is no <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> from the Parliamentary Library because the time frame is far too short. Opposition advisers have had only the scantest of briefings on some aspects of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised to improve the standards in this House, to give the House time to properly consider legislation. This shabby record that I have referred to shows the hollowness of the promises made in relation to the parliament. Not only are they treating the House like a rubber stamp, but the Treasurer (Mr Costello) never bothers to participate in these debates which he claims are so urgent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ought to compare that record with the record of the government in actually getting this so&hyphen;called urgent legislation before the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9965"> House. Last week we had one of the more extreme examples of these double standards. It has taken the government since March 1996 to bring forward legislation that had already been introduced by Labor in 1995 to clamp down on trafficking in trust losses. So we have had to wait for 19 months for the legislation. After we waited for 19 months, the government demanded immediate passage through the House, because they have been so tardy in developing policy and converting it into legislation&mdash;and, in the process, watering it down, so that the major tax avoidance problem in this country today, the use of trusts for tax avoidance, continues pretty much unabated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997   before us this evening contains another example of gross indolence. There are in the bill some important anti-fraud measures relating to computers and sales tax. That is a serious problem. Indeed, the Treasurer announced that he would be acting against these fraudulent practices in the 1996 budget&mdash;around 15 months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor supports this crackdown. But we do ask why it has it taken so long for such an important measure to come to parliament; how much revenue this delay has cost; and whether any law abiding businesses been put out of business by the delay in cracking down on the cheats in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Labor has been happy to cooperate with reasonable requests, but we do not intend to be so cooperative with unreasonable requests in future. The government is entitled to reasonable treatment of its legislative program&mdash;and it has certainly got that from this side of the House&mdash;but, equally, an opposition is entitled to have reasonable time to properly consider the issues involved in that legislation. To bring bills into the House on Thursday and then debate them the following Tuesday does not amount to that. We have not been getting a fair go, and I remind the government of its proper obligations in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the provisions of this bill. As the name suggests, it is the fifth omnibus taxation bill for 1997. It covers a wide variety of issues. Indeed, I think that the scope of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation is too broad. I do not think it is an appropriate set of measures to be contained within an omnibus bill as if its measures were relatively unimportant or uncontroversial. There are a number of quite separate issues which really ought to be dealt with by independent legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are important capital gains tax provisions which are designed to assist small business. My colleague the shadow minister for small business and customs, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), has a particular interest in these provisions, and he will be speaking later in the debate about this and other small business matters. In addition, the government's new and, let me say, inadequate infrastructure borrowing provision, which has taken over eight months to come before the parliament, is included in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a litany of problems associated with this proposal compared with the provisions which Labor had introduced and had established. Some of these are: first, that the funding is quite inadequate; second, that the scope of the infrastructure projects which can be assisted under the scheme is totally inadequate; and, third, that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) has replaced the arms&hyphen;length arbiter under Labor's scheme, the Development Allowance Authority, which was intended to depoliticise the process and give it some independent examination. Those are issues which my Victorian colleagues, the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) and the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), both have a keen interest in, and they will be participating in the subsequent debate in the House on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To go back to the capital gains tax rollover provisions, we find that, in broadening the rollover provisions, the provisions will allow a rollover when a business is conducted through a company or a unit trust and the company or unit trust is disposed of. Conceptually, this is an extension of the current rollover regime which only allows a rollover for the sale of a business when that business is conducted by an individual as a sole trader.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9966">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could ask why the government did not introduce an adequate provision in the first place. It ought to have known that the original proposals did not take account of the fact that many small businesses are conducted through companies and unit trusts and that, therefore, many small businesses would be completely excluded from the change that the government has trumpeted as being so vital for small business. Furthermore, it ought to be said that the complexity associated with rollover relief as it now stands almost beggars belief. To complicate matters further, legislation in three separate bills&mdash;the No. 1 bill, the No. 3 bill and now the No. 5 bill&mdash;has dealt with capital gains tax instead of there being a complete set of proposals for the parliament to consider in a more rational way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill contains further amendments to the rollover provisions. So, despite the government having had 15 months from the election until the commencement of these provisions, the full legislation has not yet been passed by the parliament and already the government is having to come back in here and move amendments to its scheme. Let us not forget either that the concession has in the process been increased by an estimated $90 million per year, so the full cost of the rollover concession is now $300 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer continually tells the House and the country that the taxation system is about to fall apart. He is continually painting the picture that the revenue base is unsure and inadequate, full of holes. We know that there will always be a need to clamp down on tax avoidance and that there will always be a need to make sure that the tax base, whenever it is threatened, is shored up. But, rather than shore up the income tax base&mdash;as you would expect the Treasurer to do if it was in such a state of poor repair&mdash;the government has introduced and created new holes in the base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the family tax initiative of around $1 billion per year; there is the health insurance rebate of around $600 million per year; there is the tax rebate for self&hyphen;funded retirees worth $70 million per year; there are capital gains tax concessions for small business worth almost $400 million per year; and there is a further $50 million per year in fringe benefits 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tax concessions. In addition, the government is proposing to cut a further $2 billion per year out of the base when the full effects of the savings rebate are included. So, that is around $4 billion per year that the government has removed from the base on its own volition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor does not oppose all these initiatives; we are saying that the rhetoric underlying the government's crusade for a GST is demonstrably false. There is no crisis in Australia's tax base which is not manageable in the normal way through a fair dinkum attack on tax avoidance. We need no more proof than the fact that the government claims that it will be back into surplus next year. How can a government with a supposedly broken tax base be in surplus throughout the whole forward estimates period?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is particularly ludicrous, given that the government voluntarily sacrificed around $4 billion from that tax base, as I have previously outlined to the House. There is no need for a regressive change to the taxation system, and this government knows it. There are issues to be addressed, as there always will be issues to address, but we do not need to tax families' food, clothing and entertainment in that process, which is just one part of the impact of a GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In mentioning the GST, I come to the principal revenue matter in this legislation. The bill proposes altering the wholesale sales tax regime which applies to personal computers and related goods to overcome fraud. Wholesale sales tax evasion is apparently a significant problem in the computer industry. Apart from the estimated $80 million per year in evaded revenue, tax evasion also significantly alters the commercial environment through granting an unfair competitive advantage to those engaged in fraudulent practices. I am sure that everybody would agree that it is not appropriate that people who conduct business in the right way and pay their proper share of sales tax should be at a competitive disadvantage when others are not prepared to pay their fair share of sales tax. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> reported as recently as 14 October that a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9967"> Melbourne man was charged with fraud of over $1 million concerning sales tax on computers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures in the bill seek to deny the current right of a person to purchase computers and related equipment tax free unless the person has been accredited by the Taxation Office as a person likely to fulfil their proper taxation obligations. The regime has been designed in a generic manner so that other goods can be dealt with under the altered arrangements if there is concern about fraudulent practices with these other goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, it appears that the government has specifically considered and rejected a multistage tax model&mdash;that is, a GST&mdash;to deal with the fraud. The opposition is interested to know why this multistage tax model was rejected. Was it because the industry would not wear, would not support, the additional paperwork and costs associated with the cessation of the exemptions which make the sales tax system relatively simple to comply with? It would seem the government looked GST, multistage tax, for the computer industry in the eye and decided against it. Even though the government has rejected a GST style solution in this context, we are constantly told, nonetheless, that a GST will solve Australia's problems. I say to the House that this represents still further evidence that the GST is totally unsuitable to solve any problems in Australia's taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Another proposal in this quite wide&hyphen;ranging bill is that of converting a tax rebate under the CRAFT scheme to a cash payment to employers for certain classes of apprentices. Presently, employers who take on apprentices receive a tax rebate. The proposal in this bill is that that be converted to a cash payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The details of this proposal are quite unclear at this stage. As I indicated earlier, the first we saw of the bill was on Thursday. Essentially, our position is that if the proposal is revenue neutral&mdash;that is to say, the support for employers who take on apprentices is unchanged&mdash;we have no opposition to the change in the payment method. But if the aggregate level of cash payments which are to replace the tax rebate granted under the CRAFT scheme is less than the tax rebates 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this would indicate a lessening in the level of support for apprenticeships. That is something which the opposition would not support. We propose to explore that issue at the consideration in detail stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There is a plethora of amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to effect technical amendments and to align the provisions in the new act with recently enacted legislation. I indicate to the House that, when we get to the consideration in detail stage, my colleague the shadow minister for resources and energy, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), will concentrate on this aspect of the legislation and will raise the concern that he has expressed to the House on a number of occasions about the role of the Western Australian Liberals in the taxation treatment of prospecting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are, indeed, many questions outstanding in this legislation which has been introduced to the House so recently. We will be attempting to get some answers in the Senate on these important issues. In particular, we are concerned about what the government is doing with infrastructure borrowings. Our view is that this bill ought to be withdrawn and redrafted to properly address the adequacy of the funding for new infrastructure programs, and that the eligibility for infrastructure borrowings ought to be extended to projects beyond the transport sectors into the energy, water and communications sectors. We propose to pursue these issues in the consideration in detail stage. With the support of the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), I move the following amendment to the second reading motion for this bill:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the view that the Government should withdraw and redraft Schedule 3 of the Bill to properly address the adequacy of the funding for new infrastructure programs, as well as extending eligibility to projects beyond the transport sectors into the energy, water and communications sectors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment reflects the opposition's view that the government's handling of infrastructure borrowings has not been appropriate. The level of assistance under the program has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9968"> been dramatically reduced from some $200 million per year under Labor to a level announced by the Treasurer of $75 million, with the maximum annual concession to be set by instrument by the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I might make one observation, in my capacity as member for Wills, about the infrastructure borrowing programs: Labor has taken the view that it is not appropriate that this sort of borrowing concession ought to support urban toll roads. In Melbourne we have had the experience of City Link being constructed as a toll road and being supported through infrastructure borrowing concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that the City Link toll road will force traffic away from City Link&mdash;or the former Tullamarine Freeway&mdash;onto other roads which presently do not have that amount of traffic, as motorists will seek to avoid paying the toll. I regard that as an entirely inappropriate kind of transport device. It is regrettable that the state government has seen fit to construct City Link. In one sense, they are saying, `We are going to improve Melbourne's transport links,' but it really amounts to a privatisation of our road system. That will be very much to the detriment of people who live in the areas close to the freeway and, indeed, those who have been able to use the freeway in the past without having to pay the toll. I am certain that there will be a transport debacle when that road is finished and motorists seek to avoid paying the toll in droves. So in terms of sound economic theory and sound infrastructure theory, it simply does not meet that test. That is why the opposition is continuing to take its past position of not supporting further urban toll roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Once again, we regret that we have had only a handful of days to consider the wide&hyphen;ranging measures introduced in this bill. It simply is not good enough. We expect that the government will show the House and the opposition a greater courtesy in future and will not seek to railroad initiatives through. We intend that some of the measures in this bill will be more closely examined in the Senate. We have moved a second reading amendment which we believe will help improve the contents of this bill. It is our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> intention to pursue a number of matters at the consideration in detail stage.</PARA>

Those projects include the Oakey power station in Queensland, the Parkeston power station in Kalgoorlie in Western Australia and, in particular, the ones around my electorate and in my electorate: the Port Stephens sewage processing facility in Port Stephens, based at Raymond Terrace, and the Redbank power station project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way these facilities get the rebate under the legislation is that the rebate is paid to the lender, who passes that rebate through to the project by reducing the interest rate on the loan or using some other similar arrangement. The bottom line is that for such projects to go ahead there needs to be incentive at times to climb over the mountain of cash that is required in the beginning to get these projects going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to go through two of these projects in particular. The first project is the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9969"> Redbank power station. As we know, the infrastructure borrowings tax rebate is a replacement of the IB tax concession, which terminated back on 14 February 1997. This project will inject some $300 million into the Hunter Valley economy. That is a real injection of dollars, confidence and hope for the people in the Hunter. The project will go on. It will provide some 200 construction jobs on site and over 1,000 jobs off site. More importantly, when this project is fully operational, the plant will employ 50 people directly and several hundred people indirectly. What that will do is inject on a regular basis some $10 million into our local economy, which will lift up our Hunter economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of the recent decision by BHP to downsize, projects of this magnitude are important. Every month we see the unemployment figures come out, and we have seen great fluctuations of over two per cent in a month in the Hunter. The only people who seem to get all hot and jolly over this fluctuation in unemployment figures are the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and, of course, the grim reaper, the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). He is the only person that I know who seems to get a sense of enjoyment out of unemployment figures going up and down on a monthly basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say what is important about the Redbank power project, I need only quote Mr Roy Alper, Director of National Power Australia. When the project approval was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 15 September, Mr Alper said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are delighted by the Commonwealth Government's decision to assure the project support under a new infrastructure investment programme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It means we can proceed to close our financing and start construction within a few weeks. It also means we will be able to proceed with Redbank No. 2, a project of very similar dimensions in the same area.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whilst I will be the first to admit that Redbank is not in my electorate&mdash;Singleton is some 60 kilometres outside of my electorate&mdash;there will be a lot of people in my electorate, particularly from the Maitland area and around the whole Hunter Valley, who will have input. Some of the contractors who will be working on that job will obviously come from within my area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The project also has another outstanding contribution to make, and that is to the environment. Redbank power station has been developed so that it can use coal tailings. This is world&hyphen;first technology. Normally when we go through the coalmining area we end up with a range of tailings that contain dirt, mud and other impurities that cannot be on&hyphen;sold to our overseas clients. They utilise the waste coal which is collected in ponds around the washers as the principal fuel to generate electricity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So for every tonne of coal which is removed from the mines we are getting maximum use. What this does in the whole process is reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from the mining process. We are all aware of how important the subject of greenhouse gas emissions is to Australia. It has been the topic of much debate over recent times. I am sure that this is one of the projects that we as a government will take forward to December's Kyoto summit in Japan on greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How this project works is that National Power has developed fluidised bed combustion technology in America and, in conjunction with the University of Newcastle, they will apply the Jameson cell technology, which the university developed, which optimises the efficiency of the fuel.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I never thought I would see the day where the environment movement would be supporting a coal burning electricity generation station, but that is what we have seen on this project. We have seen a utilisation of waste; we have seen a reduction in greenhouse gases; we have seen efficiency; and we have seen the support of the environment movement. I think the government and, more particularly, the people at National Power Australia are to be congratulated on this project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second project that is included within this infrastructure bonds tax rebate section is the one that I am particularly pleased with and proud of, and that is based in Raymond Terrace in Port Stephens. I have to congratulate the Port Stephens Council on their vision to look at achieving one of the benchmarks that they set, and that was to reduce the landfill component of their rubbish by 60 per 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9970"> cent. The contract that has been let to Bedminster Bioconversion Corporation (Australasia) for a co-composting facility that is valued at $10 million&mdash;another injection of $10 million into our local economy&mdash;will help the Port Stephens Council not only achieve the reductions that they have set in landfill but exceed those reductions, and there are other benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This project, as it goes through, will employ some 50 people directly in the first stages of construction, and many more off&hyphen;site. After that it will employ some 12 people on a continuing basis. That is another 12 full&hyphen;time jobs and another 12 sets of pay packets circulating throughout the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The beaut part about this co&hyphen;composting facility is that it will extract recyclables and turn sewage sludge, garbage and green waste into agricultural grade compost, resulting in an incredible 80 per cent reduction in local landfill. Overall, the way this project will work is that three cylindrical containers, each 165 feet long and 12 feet in diameter, will rotate one revolution every 24 hours with the refuse being pre-sorted. It will go through this initial stage for three days. After that it comes out and is sieved to remove the solids from it and is then spread on a maturation bed, which will take another 28 days, at which time warm air is circulated through it to get the composting, the whole organic cycle of the project, working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day this does not get rounded up and tipped off as landfill. This product can be assembled and pelletised or put out in bags as what some of us who have green fingers&mdash;I probably have brown fingers when it comes to the garden&mdash;commonly call potting mix. There are many advantages in this. It will take some 7,200 tonnes per annum of sewage sludge which we currently pump out of our treatment works into the ocean, destroying the clean, beautiful waterways off Port Stephens in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anything that reduces dumping and pollution of the environment&mdash;and I have got to say that my electorate is probably one of the most pristine areas, containing areas such as the Barrington wilderness area through to the waterways of Port Stephens&mdash;such projects 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the government's investment in these projects through the infrastructure rebates is to be encouraged. It is money very well spent and invested not only in employment and in reduction of landfill but also, importantly, in improving our environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said that the tourism facilities in the Hunter Valley are second to none, but one of the things that we do have there, of which I am sure many of you are aware, and that our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) visits on a regular basis, is Hawks Nest, which is on the northern side of the Port Stephens waterway. It is a pristine waterway which has the Myall Lakes connecting into it. But it will be pristine only as long as we reduce the amount of pollutants going into that waterway. Imagine the leeching as we start to dump all of our rubbish into landfill sites, and if those landfill sites are not properly developed that leeching will run through from the dumped waste into our wetland areas, going down through to the waterway, and very soon we will see what is a pristine bluewater wonderland ending up looking perhaps how the Georges River looked many years ago when it was the common thing to just dump and allow things to run off into it. I do not want to see that happen, and that is why I said I really congratulate Port Stephens council on its foresight and initiative in going in and looking at this type of project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum up, what this says is that the Howard government, through these two projects, is again committed to the Hunter Valley, committed to creating jobs and committed to the environment. One could say that through these two projects in this area we have donned the green beret and are earning our environmental stripes, because it is a commitment&mdash;not a cheap commitment&mdash;to make sure that together we all work towards a better future in the Hunter Valley. The investment of $310 million, when you combine these two projects together, will create one hell of a lot of on&hyphen;flow effect with engineering, manufacturing and development. It is very welcome and I look forward to the work commencing. I understand Redbank is about to get under way now. The co-composting unit will commence in January and we will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9971"> start to see almost instantaneously the environmentally friendly aspects coming out of this.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some comments on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R353">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997</XREF>  with respect, primarily, to one aspect of the bill which relates to infrastructure borrowings. The legislation proposes to restrict the available infrastructure borrowings tax concession to $75 million per annum and to restrict it to infrastructure in the road and rail sectors. The opposition has moved a second reading amendment that stands in the name of the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson). I, of course, support that amendment, which outlines the opposition's general position with respect to the infrastructure borrowing issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infrastructure bonds were introduced by the Keating government as a means of increasing the degree of infrastructure investment in this country emerging from the One Nation program. Unfortunately, they became a prime avenue for tax avoidance because of one or two loopholes. Very late in the term of the Keating government it was announced that infrastructure borrowing arrangements would be removed with respect to urban roads. There were clear lessons to be learned from how that infrastructure borrowing tax concession had been administered and the way that it had been distorted by the activities of the tax avoidance industry. So there was a recognition on the part of the opposition of the situation when the government announced that it was going to close off the infrastructure borrowing arrangements that did prevail and come forward with new arrangements, but unfortunately the new arrangements that have emerged are very restricted, and restricted to areas where perhaps they should not be, particularly in the area of urban roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make some general comments about infrastructure and the role of government in infrastructure and how the Australian government should be providing for infrastructure investment in this country. Infrastructure is usually an intermediate good. It is generally not something that is consumed directly by consumers but it facilitates consumption&mdash;a good example being airports. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Airports are not consumed by consumers; aviation services are consumed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infrastructure is characterised by a variety of things: it is usually long&hyphen;lived fixed assets that involve very substantial sunk costs in terms of investment, it is likely to have a very large and diffuse number of users and it usually involves investment in an initial surplus of capacity which eventually will be filled by long&hyphen;term use. So when you are building a piece of infrastructure, part of that decision is to anticipate future use and, indeed, future clustering of industries and economic activity which tends to occur around particular forms of infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is notable that the presence of appropriate infrastructure is one of the key factors which tends to influence the locational decisions that are made by firms. As a result, infrastructure is a critical factor in regional economic advantage and a very powerful weapon in regional development policy for any government which seeks to influence the economic future of the regions of our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of debate in recent times about our effort in infrastructure in this country, particularly public investment in infrastructure. One of the debates that occurred within the Keating government, over some considerable time, was the progressive decline since the 1960s in the amount of our gross domestic product being invested in infrastructure. When you looked on the graph there was a substantial decline, particularly in the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Superficially, these figures give some cause for concern. However, it is worth noting that, firstly, the total amount of expenditure is only part of the issue. The most important factor about infrastructure investment is where the investment is made and in what. So getting the investment right is just as important as the total amount of dollars that you are investing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, when you look at the history of economic development since the Second World War, you find that we had a huge bulge of infrastructure investment in the postwar period in things like power stations, gas reticulation, sewerage and the Snowy Mountains scheme. For example, in the small country town where I grew up, I can recall when the electricity was put on. I can recall 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9972"> when the gas was put on. I can recall when the sewerage was put on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extension of new infrastructure networks to remote Australia is now relatively limited because most of those infrastructure networks have been built. In other words, the emphasis now is more on maintenance and upgrading rather than the massive amount of infrastructure investment in building new infrastructure and new networks which occurred in the 1950s and 1960s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there can be no doubt that we have become a great deal more efficient in the way in which we build, operate and maintain infrastructure and that, therefore, can mean that there is a significantly lower primary investment. Nonetheless, the overall economic benefits that are being obtained from our infrastructure programs are at least as good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the structure of our economy is shifting, as is the structure of all Western economies, away from infrastructure intensive economic activity. More and more our economy is dominated by human services and by high&hyphen;tech manufacturing&mdash;all of which are less dependent upon traditional infrastructure than some of the older forms of economic activity. The end result is that the proportion of our economy which relies heavily on the traditional forms of infrastructure is less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About one&hyphen;third of Australia's capital stock consists of infrastructure of some form or another and about 90 per cent of that infrastructure is government owned. The efficiency of our infrastructure operation is roughly about 10 per cent below the OECD average, which is of some concern. In spite of the comments which I have just made about the decline in investment, our overall investment in infrastructure is still significantly higher than the OECD average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary theme that I want to conclude with is that infrastructure provision is a core business of government. From any rational economic perspective, the provision of infrastructure is a primary function for government. One of the problems with tax concession schemes that seek to involve the private sector in infrastructure provision in a way that it has not been before is that economic irrationality can often seep in and inappropriate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allocation decisions can emerge because there is rational economic logic in the government being the dominant provider of infrastructure in most, but not all, instances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will run through a few reasons this proposition is correct. Firstly, infrastructure often involves the anticipation of demand, which is very difficult for individuals to express in any collective way other than via government. Public transport is a classic example of this. If there is not a train line, it is not easy for individuals who potentially might use it to express their demand. Government provision of infrastructure is about coordinating that demand and giving a response to that demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, if infrastructure is privately provided in a pure sense, then there is a classic dilemma for the private provider. Either the private provider restricts access to that infrastructure and therefore creates a situation where you may have to have multiple infrastructure where one would suffice, or alternatively they allow open access and thereby potentially dilute the return that they may get from their investment. One of the reasons we are now grappling with the Hilmer principles of access to infrastructure is precisely because it is wasteful to duplicate infrastructure, but a private owner of infrastructure, or a government in some instances, has an incentive to restrict access to that infrastructure. The Optus and Telstra dilemma is a very good illustration of this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, infrastructure provision is a core business of government because of the requirement for long-term capital in very substantial amounts. It is very important to note that government debt is by no means an evil of itself. Government debt to finance current consumption is clearly undesirable, but government debt to build assets that deliver long-term economic rewards is clearly a very different matter. Unfortunately, we live in an era where there is an obsession with beautifying government balance sheets to a point where infrastructure provision is being damaged. We have amongst the lowest government debt in the OECD and we are still grappling with this obsession about government debt and, in certain parts of Australia, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9973"> suffering from inadequate infrastructure provision as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to note that financing infrastructure through means such as government debt is an important mechanism for ensuring intergenerational equity so that those who benefit from the infrastructure in 30 years time are helping to pay for the cost of the provision of that infrastructure rather than it being funded on a direct pay&hyphen;as&hyphen;you&hyphen;go basis. A noteworthy example is the Melbourne City Link project. The additional cost that the community will pay for that project because it is being funded by a BOOT scheme, by a private owner, is somewhere in the vicinity of $500 million in present net value, or maybe even more, because of the greater cost to borrowing. The higher internal return estimated by Transurban themselves is around three per cent additional internal return required to finance it as a private investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has to come from somewhere. Where does it ultimately come from? It is going to be paid by road users through tolls. As a general proposition, the government's ability to obtain cheaper long-term capital is a very good reason why infrastructure funding should be in the public sector. But it is not an absolute, because, clearly, potentially government credit ratings can be affected and if government borrowing goes beyond a certain point the equation will change. Leaving aside that reductio ad absurdum, as a general proposition, having infrastructure provision in the public sector, particularly major pieces of infrastructure, makes sense economically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next reason it is important is that major pieces of infrastructure typically benefit people in three different ways, and roads are a good example. They benefit direct users, indirect beneficiaries and the community generally. For example, a major freeway will benefit the direct users of the freeway. Secondly, it will benefit some people indirectly, such as those who live adjacent to other roads nearby who will have less congestion on their roads, at least in theory, because people are now using the new road. Thirdly, it will benefit the entire community as a result of increased economic activity and cheaper 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> freight. Private owners of an infrastructure are less able to capture those economic benefits and distribute the burdens according to the balance between the various beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the question of risk allocation. It is generally much harder for the private sector to allocate appropriately the variety of risks that are entailed in a project such as City Link. The end result is a contract like the City Link one in Melbourne where almost all of the risk associated with that project has in fact been reabsorbed by the government. So there is a lengthy list of provisions in that contract which provide that, in the event of a future government doing certain things or in the event of a certain future event occurring, the government of the day will be obliged to pay compensation in the millions of dollars to Transurban.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that existing roads are being closed or narrowed. It means that the government is signing up and committing itself and future governments to not build the rail link to Tullamarine airport and various other things&mdash;all of which are entirely anti-competitive and are forced on the government because the presence of the risk in that contract naturally lies with the government. The nature of the infrastructure project is such that the government is really the only body that can handle and deal with all of those risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can compare that with the risk that the average private operator in business faces. If you run a sandwich shop that is next to a tax office in regional Australia&mdash;one of the many tax offices that the Howard government has closed&mdash;and most of your business comes from people working in that tax office, you do not get any compensation for your sandwich shop because you have just lost half your clients. Yet under a BOOT scheme you have all these bizarre arrangements with respect to potential future occurrences which may inhibit or disadvantage your economic return. The end result is that you have a de facto public sector scheme but in reality something that the private sector is benefiting from at great expense to the public, particularly motorists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are land use and planning issues which mean that the government is necessari 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9974"> ly likely to have to be integrally involved. An example is the very fast train project. In particular, infrastructure is often an addition to an existing network where it is difficult to determine where the additional benefit can actually be separated from the existing network. When you are adding a new road, how is it that you can measure the additional benefit for road users that that new road entails? Again, the City Link project in Melbourne is a good example. It is very hard for a private operator to capture, determine and define those benefits in an equitable way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a mythology that infrastructure bonds and tax concessions in some way unlock new sources of finance for infrastructure that otherwise is inaccessible. This is pure myth. Private investors have funded infrastructure in this country since time immemorial but historically through loans to government, through government debt&mdash;private money going to buy the bonds that finance the infrastructure. All that infrastructure bonds and tax concessions do is change the mechanism of mediation in a way that in most instances is negative for the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a general proposition, infrastructure provision should be regarded as the core business of government. There are obvious exceptions. Clearly, construction of infrastructure should be the subject of competitive tendering, and indeed is, and predominantly privately provided. Secondly, private operation of infrastructure is entirely feasible in certain circumstances. Vertical disaggregation of infrastructure is an issue that we are all grappling with in various sectors. There are certain stand&hyphen;alone projects that are not so much additions to old networks but stand&hyphen;alone projects that are inherently riskier than something like building a new freeway in an established freeway, such as the one in Melbourne I have referred to, where the private sector leading the way makes sense. The private sector taking the lead and assuming the risk in something like a very fast train makes sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate should be about allocative efficiency, not about the total benefits that accrue as a result of beautifying government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> balance sheets or myths associated with the private sector always being better. The tax breaks that are available should be scrutinised very carefully and should be provided only on the basis that the net economic benefit to the nation is a positive one through providing this infrastructure via means of the private sector rather than the public sector.</PARA></SPEECH>

This bill is one of the legislative outcomes of the coalition's commitment to Australia's small business sector. The coalition has always valued the contribution that small businesses make to our economy and the changes to the capital gains tax contained in this bill confirm our commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes in removing the penalties on small businesses which in the past have prevented them from expanding. Under Labor, people who sold a business to trade up to a bigger one were slugged with the capital gains tax, which effectively meant they had less money to invest in a new business. The government has now removed the disincentive for business investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the 1996 election campaign, the coalition announced it would be introducing rollover relief for capital gains tax where a small business sold one asset to purchase a similar asset. We delivered in full in last year's budget. However, we did not stop there. On 24 March 1997, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced the capital gains tax measures contained in this bill as part of the government's response to the Small Business Deregulation Task Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation will, in part, allow for the expansion of capital gains tax rollover relief. Currently the measures allow for rollover relief for capital gains on the disposal of active assets of a small business where replacement active assets are acquired. This bill will allow for a capital gain on the sale of a business to be rolled over where this is done through the sale of shares or units. There will also be certain nominated shares and units eligible as replacement assets for the purposes of this provision.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9975">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is determined to improve the conditions for doing business in this country. For the 13 years that Labor was in office it did nothing for small business, except place obstacles in the way of growth and introduce a complex and punitive taxation system. Since coming to office 18 months ago, the coalition has acted quickly to fix the mess left by 13 years of Labor. Among our achievements already are the reforms to the industrial relations system, the reduction in paperwork for small business, a reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor, and relief for capital gains tax payable on business investment. This legislation introduces further expansion to capital gains tax relief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I recently surveyed Northern Territory businesses the issue of most concern to them was our taxation system. They tell me that it is complicated and discourages investment and growth. The government has listened to these concerns and acknowledges that the current system needs an overhaul. I welcome the current debate on taxation reform. The creation of the government's tax consultative task force, chaired by Senator Gibson, is further proof of our commitment to reform. I understand that reform of the tax system could be under way in less than a year, which is good news for all Australians. The government recognises that we can do more with capital gains tax relief to encourage small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has pushed hard for capital gains tax exemptions on retirement. This would allow small business owners, who have reinvested their earnings in their business rather than superannuation, to retire on the proceeds of their business, free of capital gains tax. Once again, Labor is showing its complete lack of understanding and disdain for the needs of small business people and is opposing this measure in the Senate. I hope for the sake of our business community that Labor finally stops playing partisan politics and acts in the best interests of small business, the engine room of our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the bill at hand, the major provision is the amendments to the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992. These amendments will help combat sales tax evasion, which is rife in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> computer industry. The government has been involved in consultation with interested parties and has come up with amendments that should put an end to sales tax fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 2 of this bill will establish a new sales tax regime for computer suppliers. Sales tax evasion is nothing new. We have seen similar problems in relation to other goods including motor vehicles, video recorders, amusement machines and stereo equipment. During the consultation period, the government heard evidence of extensive sales tax evasion in this sector. The impact of this fraudulent activity cannot be underestimated. It often has the effect of disadvantaging smaller businesses who are usually less able to absorb the competitive disadvantage. This fraudulent activity is costing the government approximately $80 million every year. I think this figure illustrates, quite dramatically, the problem some of our smaller computer businesses have to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To address this competitive advantage enjoyed by fraudulent companies, the government has introduced amendments in this bill to ensure all operators will be dealt with in a fair and consistent manner. The aim of these amendments is to force fraudulent operators to tow the line or go out of business. The government has been advised by experts in the industry that this fraudulent behaviour is not detected by the normal administrative procedures. Therefore, our amendments will have the effect of preventing the offences from occurring in the first place, rather than detecting it after the event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The central feature of the new system will mean that tax&hyphen;free access to section 7A goods, which are personal computers and their related items, will be restricted to only those taxpayers who have established that they are likely to fulfil their tax obligations. People who satisfy the criteria set down by the government and the Australian Taxation Office will be accredited. Only ATO accredited people will have the ability to quote effectively, which will then entitle them to purchase section 7A goods tax free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to prevent unlawful use of an accreditation number, the quote will also have to be authorised. The accredited person will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9976"> be able to continue trading in the same way they currently do and their sales tax obligations will remain the same. The only change will be a slight increase in record keeping in respect of the quote authorisation. However, as authorisation can be obtained over the phone, businesses should not be subjected to too much inconvenience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should state, however, that accredited people will be under obligation to keep records relating to any dealings with unaccredited dealers. Dealers who trade with unaccredited individuals will also be required to withhold an amount equal to the amount of tax due on the equipment to be remitted to the commissioner. This should ensure the measures cannot be sidestepped. Organisations like public benevolent institutions will be exempt from the requirement for accreditation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also amends the income tax law to provide a rebate of tax on interest derived by a lender to an approved road or rail infrastructure project. Resident lenders who meet approved criteria, as set down by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, may qualify for a tax rebate on their interest income at the general company rate of tax. The borrower will be denied a deduction to the extent that the interest paid to the lender is tax rebateable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to remove income tax exemption of the rebated payment to employers under the Commonwealth rebate for apprentice full&hyphen;time training, CRAFT, scheme. This bill also includes some minor technical and drafting amendments. This legislation is another step forward in the process of reforming the conditions for doing business in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R353">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997</XREF>  essentially to discuss the extent to which it relates to the issue of infrastructure. We have moved a second reading amendment which, in essence, calls on the government to redraft the bill to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> address the concerns which we have on the new infrastructure tax rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to raise an issue of process first. That is, this bill came into the House last Thursday and fewer than six days later, but essentially two sitting days later, the opposition is expected to have fully considered the technical and complex details associated with the bill. There was supposed to be an understanding that there be at least a week between the introduction of the bill and the resumption of the debate. This was something the government when in opposition kept insisting on so far as we were concerned, but that has not happened on this occasion. Part of the reason that I am speaking earlier in the debate rather than later&mdash;I do also have another commitment later&mdash;is that I understand it is the intention of the government to conclude this bill tonight, presumably that means the guillotine, but there was never any discussion or understanding with us as to timing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important piece of legislation. We thought there would have been more time to consider the policy formulation response because the Labor Party actually does engage in policy development and formulation but, due to the government's decision to minimise that opportunity so far as we are concerned, to restrict our ability to fully consider this bill in debate in this chamber, it is our intention to move more detailed amendments in the Senate. We will also be using the processes of the Senate chamber to ensure that the bill is given full and proper consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that claims to be about creating jobs, yet it is a government that has no long-term commitment to savings, to increased public or private investment nor to infrastructure expenditure. This is a government that broke its commitments to lifting the savings of the nation by failing to deliver on the three per cent government co-contribution, which would have delivered $100,000 into the retirement income of an average earner. Instead, it replaced it with a savings rebate which picked up everyone, including the very wealthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infrastructure is an important aspect to the economic development dimension and, in particular, to jobs. Mr Derek Sicklen of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9977"> Australian Economic Analysis Pty Ltd has produced significant research that shows that employment growth is directly linked to capital investment by the nation. When capital investment as a percentage of gross domestic product is high, the unemployment rate is shown to drop. There is significant evidence of correlation between public and private investment expenditure and employment since 1978 to 1997. This is information that is publicly available, produced by Mr Sicklen's analysis unit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Job creation does rely on a buoyant economy, an economy which is engaging in both public and private capital investment. This is a relationship that is not unique to Australia. It is, in fact, mirrored throughout the OECD countries. It would seem that one very real solution to unemployment is the re-invigoration of public capital investment and policies to increase private capital investment. The government has a role to play in both supporting infrastructure spending in so far as public capital investment is concerned and supporting industry policy to ensure the appropriate private investment response is followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has been putting pressure on the government by leading the political debate on industry policy. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his government have been forced to follow on the issues of ships bounties and books bounties&mdash;decisions that we forced them to reverse. They were forced to follow in terms of the future direction for the automotive and textile industries. They were forced to accept the rhetoric at least by the Prime Minister of the need for strategic intervention in industry&mdash;rhetoric only, in relation to that commitment, no detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Halfway through the term of this government there is still no industry policy, and all sectors of industry are calling out for it. We are still awaiting a response to the Mortimer, Goldsworthy and Cutler reports, not to mention the legion of industry reports that have come forward identifying the need for an industry policy and calling on the government to develop one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is this government is lacking leadership. The Prime Minister is not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up to it. He has earned that tag of Mr Wishy-Washy because he has no ideas, no vision, no policies, just reactions to crises. That reaction, in most cases, is to deny any involvement on his part and see the bodies fall around him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as infrastructure is concerned, schedule 3 of this bill seeks to put in place a tax rebate system for infrastructure investments to replace Labor's infrastructure borrowing concession. That borrowing scheme, which Labor introduced during its term in office, sought to lower the financing costs associated with the private provision of infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our infrastructure borrowing scheme allowed a borrower to obtain cheaper finance by making the interest non&hyphen;deductible for tax purposes to that person. It also made the interest income non&hyphen;taxable to the lender. Accordingly, a lender will lend at a cheaper rate of interest if the interest is free of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By reducing the cost overall, Labor sought to make infrastructure investment more attractive to the private sector. By shifting the tax benefit to the front end of the scheme, the borrower gained through lower cost funds, the lender benefited through receiving tax&hyphen;free income on their loans and the Commonwealth eventually benefited by certain business costs not being tax&hyphen;deductible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another significant feature of Labor's infrastructure borrowing scheme was that it extended beyond land transport facilities to sea ports, electricity generation, air transport, gas pipelines, water supply and sewerage or waste water facilities. Anyone who knows anything about regional development knows that infrastructure is not limited to land transport alone. There are other important areas for infrastructure development, and I see you, Mr Deputy Speaker Forrest, nodding in agreement with that. But the new scheme introduced by the government limits access to the infrastructure bonds just to land transport. That is a fundamental complaint that we have with the approach and it is what our amendment seeks to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 14 February this year, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced that the infrastructure borrowing scheme&mdash;the one that Labor introduced and the government said they would retain&mdash;would be frozen immediately. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9978"> reason for this snap decision was the supposed, purported rorting of the bonds scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor repeats, and has said on the record before, that we do support any sensible move by the government to eliminate unintended benefits flowing from tax concessions. However, in the process of that decision, the government also announced what it called `transitional arrangements' that it would be putting in place for projects previously given the go&hyphen;ahead by Labor. These were proposals that the consortia associated had every confidence would have been agreed to because they were  essentially ticked off before we lost office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We sought to amend the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill back in May to achieve that outcome and to let those that had been approved in through the gate. The government opposed that amendment. Labor assumed, at the time of its introduction, when the government froze this scheme, that it intended to act immediately. But, nine months later, with both the transitional arrangements and the new scheme, we have only now got an insight into what this government intends. In the meantime, 141 projects and $20 billion worth of infrastructure investment in this country have been put on ice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take the opportunity to indicate Labor's concerns with the particular details of the bill. Proposed section 396&hyphen;45 of the bill defines what type of infrastructure project will be eligible for the tax rebate. Proposed subsection (1) of 396&hyphen;45 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To be approved, a project must be the construction of a land transport facility or the construction or acquisition of one or more related facilities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Basically, the rebate is confined to road and rail infrastructure. As I said before, anyone who knows anything about the infrastructure needs of regions knows that they involve more than just road and rail. If we are going to build our regions and develop our industry, it is crucial for them to be able to invest in electricity, water, sewerage, sea ports, communications and gas pipelines&mdash;all infrastructure, not just road and rail. Without an ongoing commitment to infrastructure, regional communities are unable to sustain economic 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> growth, industry development, job creation or, ultimately, the communities themselves. They just dry up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infrastructure is the building block of the regional and industry development approaches that this nation should be embracing. If the government deems infrastructure to be in the national interest&mdash;and we hear all these noises about how important it is&mdash;then it has got to work in partnership with investors to ensure that that investment occurs. Government cannot be a passive player.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's commitment to infrastructure, regions and jobs is expressed not just in our intention to amend the infrastructure bond eligibility and the adequacy of funding but also in our intention to re-establish a regional infrastructure development fund. We also have a commitment to mechanisms for pooled development funds for regions as well as the encouragement of regional superannuation funds. Contrast that comprehensive position in terms of infrastructure support by Labor with that of the current government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Wednesday the new Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile)&mdash;essentially the new minister for land transport because he has got no other responsibilities; he is one of the newest members to the front bench&mdash;announced the go-ahead with some sort of fanfare for four transitional projects. The fact of the matter is he is not even the minister for regional development. The member for Fairfax, Mr Somlyay, is the minister for regional development. It is a portfolio that has been taken off the National Party because of their lack of interest and their betrayal of the bush, and it has now been relegated to the outer cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The senior minister, however, wanted to announce as his maiden answer in question time what Labor tried to secure by way of an amendment back in May&mdash;a bit behind the eight ball, I would suggest. Had he voted with us, he would have had these four projects up and running now rather than just the announcement of their go-ahead. All of these projects have been delayed because of this government's inaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government refused back in May to support those amendments that would have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9979"> allowed the projects to go ahead. What are the four transitional projects? They are the Redbank power station: based in the Hunter, environmentally friendly, using coal tailings to produce power, a world first, should have been up and running now, is not, got the go&hyphen;ahead but will be delayed. There is the Parkeston power station, based in Kalgoorlie to use gas from the goldfields gas pipeline and service the goldfields. There is the Oakey power station, based in Toowoomba to supply the generating requirements identified by the Queensland Transmission and Supply Corporation. And there is the Port Stephens sewage facility, Australia's first rubbish, sewage and waste co&hyphen;composting facility based in Raymond Terrace north of Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These projects had all applied for and received approval from the Development Allowance Authority for infrastructure borrowings but they had not received their certificates when the Treasurer made the snap decision. The Port Stephens sewage facility and Redbank are Australian firsts. Yet, under the tax arrangements announced by the Treasurer when he froze the decisions, they would not have been eligible because they are not road or rail projects. Instead, they had to wait an extra six months to be given special treatment, treatment which should have been afforded them back in May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in Adelaide yesterday with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). South Australia has 10.6 per cent unemployment; that is, two per cent above the national average. There are 10 projects in South Australia on hold, frozen, because of the Treasurer's decision, projects which are not going to be given special treatment because they do not fall within the definition. We are not saying that all 10 projects&mdash;or, for that matter, all 141&mdash;should be automatically guaranteed. All we are saying is that they should have the opportunity to compete. They should be able to conclude what they believe they are entitled to put forward their positions on. They should not be cut out of the game because of a precipitous decision taken by the Treasurer in pursuit of a better budget line&mdash;regardless of the consequences. The consequences occur in regional Australia. The consequences are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the inability for regions to develop their infrastructure needs and having this entitlement taken away from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need is a sense of certainty. That is what this government promised, but it has not delivered. The announcement of the Redbank power station decision was made on the eve of Labor's shadow ministry meeting in the Hunter. There is a message in all of this: wherever the Labor shadow ministry goes, the government, in future, will be making some sort of announcement to pre&hyphen;empt us. I urge those regions that know about our itinerary and program&mdash;and we will publish it for them&mdash;`Get your proposals up because good news is coming; we're coming to town.' This is the government's response: to try to pre&hyphen;empt; to react. There has been no proactivity by this government. It would not have the wit or wisdom to understand what it is doing. It knows it has to respond because Labor is running the campaigns out there for these particular initiatives, and we will keep it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that it is about supporting communities and their families. Yet, at every opportunity, the Howard government has failed to rise to the challenge. No&hyphen;one could ever forget those immortal words of betrayal of regional Australia which were uttered by the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, when, as his first act, he abolished his own department. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no clear rationale or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That statement was made by a National Party minister. If the National Party does not stand for regional Australia, what does it stand for? And because it did not stand for regional Australia, it has lost the regional development portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not accept that view. Labor is about empowering and supporting local communities to develop their own local agendas and priorities and building a confidence that we will back those agendas. It is not about big central government making decisions that have little or no meaning; it is about taking national goals and priorities and giving them 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9980"> a local significance. It is not about asking for wish lists; it is about rational and sensible proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will work in partnership with communities to ensure that we can bring those proposals forward. Infrastructure is one of the key foundations, but the government is undermining that foundation by this decision today. That is why we are moving the second reading amendment. I hope that the government accepts the amendment and joins us in a bipartisan solution. If they do, we will sit down and talk about how we get infrastructure going in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a total of 11 schedules in the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R353">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997</XREF>  which seek to amend five separate and unrelated parts of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The legislative measures in this bill are neither simple nor straightforward. The explanatory memorandum is more than 100 pages long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One does not have to go back too far into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> records to note the number of occasions on which the member for Higgins, the now Treasurer (Mr Costello), lambasted the former government for expediting legislation through the chamber in a manner that prevented proper scrutiny and debate. To borrow the words from the now Treasurer, `This parliament is here to pass legislation and to ensure that the legislation that is passed improves the way in which commercial arrangements in Australia are structured and improves the way in which this country is administered.' I endorse these sentiments wholeheartedly, but it would appear that the Treasurer is now quite prepared to compromise the very standards that he believed the previous government should have met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and it is a little bit hollow for him to complain. After all, he and his Labor government set the standard. If the Treasurer or, indeed, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) can be criticised for what they now do in the same vein, at least they have the excuse that they learnt the trade under the government of which the member for Hotham was a part. Let me say in their defence&mdash;because it is the only defence I can mount for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Leader of the House and the Treasurer in this context&mdash;that at least they knew no better because they had never been in government. Their starting point was what they observed under the previous Labor administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments were introduced into this place on Thursday last, 23 October, leaving only two working days before the scheduled debate here. That does not allow anything like sufficient time for communication with the tax fraternity, and the Treasurer knows it. Nor does it allow anything like the time needed to formulate opinions and considered argument unaided or without consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 1 of this bill seeks to build on the coalition's 1996&hyphen;97 budget commitment to foster growth in the small business sector by way of capital gains tax rollover relief. The government's decision to extend the CGT rollover measures to the sale of shares in a company and units in unit trusts is, of course, a sensible one. Small business owners will now have the option of disposing of the underlying active assets of their business or, where the business is carried on through a company or unit trust, dispose of shares or units and reinvest in other shares or units. Alternatively, they can invest in new active assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion, it appears that the coalition has engaged in a more open and consultative process with representatives from the small business community, the end result being that select small businesses will benefit from government policy. However, the fact that this measure has just been tacked on to the newly created section 17A means that the extension of the rollover relief will not apply to discretionary trusts. In other words, small businesses which operate as companies, individuals or partnerships will qualify for the rollover relief, but those that have adopted a discretionary trust structure will be excluded. That is totally unacceptable, I suggest, and should be reviewed immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the proposed holdings test will exclude multiple shareholders and minority shareholders from the exemption despite the fact that they may all be active in the business. Again, there does not appear to be any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9981"> logical reason behind such an exclusion. Some tax experts are also disappointed with the arbitrary five&hyphen;year holding threshold, arguing instead that, if the exemption is to apply to the sale of shares and units, there should be no limit on holdings at all. There is some doubt as to whether the full benefit of this measure will be realised because of the complicated nature of the legislation itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his media release dated 24 March 1997, the Treasurer acknowledged that there were `particularly complex issues of tax law design' involved with the extension of the CGT rollover relief provisions. In a recent edition of the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Retirement and estate planning</EMPHASIS>, this issue of complexity was discussed by Mr Chris Evans, Senior Lecturer, ATAX, at the University of New South Wales. It was observed that the impetus behind the coalition's decision to postpone the effect of CGT on small businesses in specific circumstances was to encourage them to expand, invest and employ. They are entirely supportable outcomes. However, Mr Evans also noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Division 17A . . . is as complex a piece of legislation as any recently introduced, and it will take taxpayers&mdash;or more importantly their advisers&mdash;some considerable time to become familiar or comfortable with this important new concession.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complexity of the legislation, combined with the restrictiveness of the provisions, means that a potentially valuable new relief will prove more limited than should have been the case.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Don Munro, Corporate Tax Partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, echoed those sentiments when he was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  as having said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They're (that is, the government)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">limiting it to things that seem unusually simple. It does seem a bit restrictive, and a bit commercially unrealistic.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Predictably, the Treasurer has defended the intricacies of this legislation and its application only to businesses with a simple structure on the grounds that it is necessary to prevent tax avoidance amongst the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a projected cost to revenue of $90 million annually, the proposed extension of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the rollover relief to shares and units will not come cheap. However, as I have said in earlier debates, those individuals who deliberately employ elaborate business structures to avoid their tax obligations will continue to do so, irrespective of the complex nature of the legislation. In the meantime, every other small business proprietor will have to wrestle with an increasingly prescriptive business environment and the accompanying burgeoning compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, the coalition has committed itself to reducing the compliance burden on small business by one&hyphen;half during the term of the present parliament. On the other, it continues to introduce legislation that proliferates administrative impositions on the business community. The compliance impact statement accompanying this bill concedes this, indicating that taxpayers will require `professional assistance' in determining the market value of active assets and the underlying assets of the trust or company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not surprisingly, one taxation expert has described the measures designed to protect government revenue as being akin to a `gangrene-inducing tourniquet' rather than a `necessary bandage'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's Small Business Deregulation Task Force indicated that the frequency and volume of taxation change remain one of the most significant impediments to growth in the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original amendments to provide capital gains tax rollover relief upon the sale of a small business where the proceeds are to be used to provide retirement income or where either a new or larger business or a similar business is acquired came into effect only on 1 July 1997. Here we are, less than four months down the track, and the government is seeking to modify those amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that the provisions in schedule 1 of this bill will give added flexibility to the CGT rollover relief scheme, but at the cost of greater legislative complexity. I noted, during the debate on trust losses, the incongruity between the frequent introduction of lengthy and complex tax legislation under the Howard government and the commitment to furthering 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9982"> the work of the tax law improvement project&mdash;TLIP, as it is known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of plain drafting of legislation&mdash;or a lack of it&mdash;was recently raised in the October 1997 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Retirement and Investment Planning</EMPHASIS>. It noted that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is surprising, given the recent release of the tax law improvement project CGT exposure drafts, that the opportunity was not taken to draft the legislation relating to the new relief in the new (and improved) style.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If the government intends to further complicate the task of TLIP by continuing to introduce unnecessarily complex legislation in the old format, then it should abandon TLIP altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most serious deficiencies in TLIP's mandate is that it contributes nothing to the review of policy or to the administration of tax legislation. It is restricted purely to renumbering and rewriting the 1936 Income Tax Assessment Act. The fact that six of the 11 schedules in this bill are required to make drafting and technical corrections to the income tax laws that are to be rewritten and renumbered by TLIP raises serious questions about the merit of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the current rate of progress by the tax law improvement project team is anything to go by, then a complete rewrite is at best 25 years away. And that projection does not take into account the fact that future amendments like these will most likely be necessary to clarify the supposedly simplified, user&hyphen;friendly TLIP instalments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts indicated that the coalition should `schedule sufficient time for parliamentary debate and review of the next tranche of legislation' so that TLIP would come under closer scrutiny in the future. Had the previous two instalments of TLIP been subjected to the correct checks and balances, schedules 5 to 11 of this bill would arguably not have been necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have consistently argued that simpler language, a better numbering system and an improved structure are certainly a step in the right direction towards tax reform. But it has always been stressed that this is at best a partial solution. The fact that the TLIP team 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has not even been able to meet this brief to date does not bode well for its future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 3 of the bill sets out the guidelines for the replacement scheme for the defunct infrastructure borrowings&mdash;or IB&mdash;program. In a now well&hyphen;worn argument, the government justified its decision to axe the former scheme on the basis of widespread rorting by the private sector. Many financiers accept that there was room to improve the integrity of the IB scheme. However, they were equally adamant that business spending on infrastructure was encouraged by the concession. A 1996 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Invest Australia</EMPHASIS> found that the Australian community had also benefited from the IB scheme by way of lower user charges because of the reduced cost of infrastructure and an increase in employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new land transport rebate is significantly more restricted than the original, as only road and rail infrastructure facilities will be considered for the concession in future. Coupled with the fact that the new rebate will be capped at $75 million annually, this narrow eligibility criterion will almost certainly see a drop in private sector expenditure on infrastructure. Industry representatives estimate that the cap will service around $2 billion in projects each year, a mere fraction of the $22 billion worth of infrastructure plans that were put on hold as a result of the axing of the IB scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should this be the case, then Australia can expect to see a slow down in our economic growth as a direct consequence of a reduction in the rate of infrastructure investment and the ensuing provision of modern infrastructure. Also, this figure does not take into account the increased tax revenues from the project providers' non&hyphen;deductible interest, which would  further reduce the cost to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those private investors who have benefited from the IB tax concession in the past are typically not looking for handouts. However, they are interested in a scheme that overcomes some of the disincentives to investing in projects characterised by long lead times before they can deduct expenses against an income flow. Just as the slashing of the research and development syndication scheme 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9983"> has forced many Australian companies to look offshore to continue their activities, the axing of the IB scheme could well persuade Australian companies to invest in foreign countries that are more supportive of the risks they take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is there doubt as to whether the new land transport infrastructure rebate will be able to sustain current levels of private sector investment, but also the cost of complying with the rebate will be substantial. In the explanatory memorandum the government states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a cost for the developer and/or financier in providing sufficient information to support the application for rebate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to note:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once a rebate is granted, there will be a further cost for the developer in negotiating an agreed contract with the government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The coalition has failed to provide any specific information on the true cost of compliance, merely stating that `these costs are unquantifiable'. That is simply not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Treasury is able to estimate the cost to government and to the Australian Taxation Office of administering the scheme, then surely it can provide projections on the cost to a developer or developers. The government has admitted that there will be a `significant' cost to revenue to manage the rebate, somewhere in the vicinity of $2 million a year. For a scheme that will offer only $75 million in tax benefits per annum, this administration fee and possible compliance costs seem disturbingly high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to stress what I said in my opening remarks. It has not been possible in the time available to consider important sections of this bill, for example, amendments to the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992. Time is simply not available, given that the bill was introduced into the parliament only last Thursday. The bill imposes sales taxes and modifies and regulates sales taxes on information technology, a very important commodity in our society these days. I have not even looked at the section which deals with removal of the exemption for CRAFT scheme payments&mdash;that is to be regretted. I simply 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say again that the treatment of the House as a legislative chamber leaves a great deal to be desired. It confers no credit on the present government, any more than the behaviour of the previous government deserves credit. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

Up until then, when he was castigating the government, and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in particular for his approach to these matters, he was dead right.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is complex. It goes to a number of issues which this government has been touting around the community as being important as it leads into its final few months of government. I refer to the issue of taxation reform. The simple fact of the matter is that, along with native title and unemployment, the third element the government is concerned about in their dying few months of government is the taxation system and its overall reform. We know that the government has created a secret committee to look at the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9984"> options that are available, and we know that, as part of the taxation reform process, a variety of issues need thorough examination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would have thought that the issues contained in this particular bill would be the sorts of issues which a government would take into consideration in a broad review of taxation policy and the taxation laws of this nation, but that is not the case. As the member for Curtin pointed out, this bill amends laws that this government introduced only recently. The area which is of greatest concern to me is the area dealing with capital gains tax for small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my capacity as the shadow minister for small business, I talk to the people who are engaged in small business; the people who are trying to eke out an existence in the environment of uncertainty created by this government. Although they know that in such an environment it is tough to make a quid as a small business person, they would like to think that, in spite of the burdens imposed on them, the commitments, the promises, made by the government before they were a government, and certainly in the last 20 months since they have been in government, will be delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The one outstanding issue, which I can well recall, is the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) saying in his role of St</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">John of the small business community that the burden of compliance and the burden of paperwork imposed on the small business community would be cut in half. I know it is unusual for this Prime Minister and this government to actually set targets, but they did. In respect of the compliance issue associated with the paperwork burden of small business, there was a commitment given&mdash;probably driven by the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash), because she was a small business person in her former life&mdash;to reduce that burden of paperwork on small business by 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet time and time again, we have seen the government come forward with suggestions that are going to do exactly the opposite. This particular change to the capital gains tax provisions for small business is an important and complex issue, but it is not going to lead 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to a reduction in that paperwork burden. Whether it was fortuitous or whether this is what has been driving the government, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 20 October, in its edition headed `Trusts threat: taxman's harder line revealed in letters', goes to some length to talk about this issue of capital gains tax. It talks about the rollover provisions being proposed by the government and goes on to outline what capital gains tax means for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On page 63 of this publication, I found it rather interesting&mdash;after you get through the exchange of letters between Mr Mark Leibler and the Commissioner for Taxation, Mr Michael Carmody&mdash;to find a statement tendered in respect to the issue of trusts which is significant because it also refers to capital gains tax:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has about 350,000 trusts, and up to 80% of small businesses are conducted through them. Tax lawyer and author Robert Richards says: "The Government is supposed to be the friend of small business, yet small business is the biggest user of trusts."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is this area where this argument is ongoing&mdash;as exposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) earlier this week in questions to the Treasurer which he refused to answer in respect of trusts&mdash;that faces immediate and important consequences of the changes being proposed in this legislation in respect of capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, in light of the government's promise to halve the paperwork requirements on small business it is inevitable that the capital gains tax rollover will actually increase the load for small business and not lessen it. Although it has been conceded by some that compliance costs will outweigh the benefits of receiving the rollover and only those applying will be required to do the paperwork, nonetheless the government has failed in its task to lower the paperwork burden on those small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would appreciate it if either the Treasurer or the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) could provide the House, in wrapping up the debate later today, with the approximate number of small businesses who will be eligible for the capital 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9985"> gains tax rollover under this new legislation. I would be very interested to see how many people out there in small businesses are actually going to benefit from this, because I am not necessarily sure that the numbers are as great as this government would have you believe. It is part of this overall rhetoric of the government about how they are there to support small business but, when you look at the fine detail, you find they are not quite there for small business. When you look at the small print of what is actually being considered, you find that not all small businesses will be affected by the legislative changes. Indeed, it may only affect a minority group of those small business people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I understand that, in the preparation of this legislation, the government has consulted with many industry lobby groups, including the National Taxation Liaison Group, over the issue of capital gains tax exemptions for small business. Yet criticisms continue to flow, and I have referred to the article that was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 20 October. On the basis of those concerns that have been raised, another question for the Treasurer to answer should be: will the government also be applying the exemption to discretionary trusts? As I have said, there are about 350,000 trusts in Australia and about 80 per cent of small business is conducted through them, so my question is: will the capital gains tax rollover provisions and the exemptions contained in this legislation be applied to discretionary trusts? Whether they are or are not to apply, what would be the effect of that in terms of revenue loss to government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, this is a government that has gone around Australia and said that within three years it would have a budget either balanced or marginally in surplus. This is a government that has gone out with P1, the Treasurer, running around this nation and saying, `We have taken the necessary steps&mdash;by slashing and burning, by cutting into the Public Service and by cutting into the allocation of funds in different areas of government expenditure&mdash;to reduce that burden.' That is the burden that this government perceive exists in terms of the deficit on the domestic economy. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But, for all the pain that has been inflicted, you have to ask the question: is it all worth it? There is an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on this issue of the application of trusts to small businesses and whether there were going to be exemptions for those small businesses that operated as discretionary trusts in respect of capital gains tax. The chairman of the Chartered Accountants' national small and medium sized enterprises committee, Mr Curt Rendell, was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I smell Treasury's hands all over this. The Government's attempts to do something for small business but Treasury feels its task is to protect the revenue at all costs. They are the Government's bean&hyphen;counters.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly, in respect of somebody like Mr Rendell representing chartered accountants in this nation, there is a concern being raised there. It remains to be seen whether Treasury will win the day once again and whether small businesses will, in fact, be helped out at all. It is another promise made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business in respect of those small businesses. Will it be kept? Their record so far is not that flash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that there is going to be debate in this place in respect of fair trading when parliament resumes the legislation in the last three weeks of these sittings. We know that the government believes it has been on a winner when it gave its response to the fair trading inquiry report, but I have to tell you that is not the view that is now coming out as people go around in the small business community and see just what has been offered. There is a lot of smoke and mirrors but not much substance&mdash;a bit like the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. He is someone who can go out and supposedly sell a message, but it is not quite the right message, not quite the truthful message. Regrettably what we see is that the opportunity will be taken when that legislation comes before the parliament to raise some points about those sorts of issues.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Gilmore interjects and asks what our attitude will be. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9986"> Our attitude will be that we will endeavour to ensure that that legislation for small businesses does exactly what the committee's report recommended that it should do. The report was universally adopted by both sides of this parliament, with one very minor dissenting report; it was pushed by the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) with the support of the Labor Party, after we had gone out and about and spoken to small businesses about what they really needed. That is what we will be doing about that when that legislation comes in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to people like my friend the member for Gilmore&mdash;my neighbour down here, whom I have known for quite some time, and she is a very successful small business woman in her own right; she ran a very good small business and knew a lot about tourism too&mdash;that we will be looking for their support when we come into this place in the next three weeks in respect of small business propositions that the government is going to introduce. We will be looking for that support when we seek to redress some of the inaccuracies, some of the anomalies and some of the problems that are contained in that legislation that has been presented to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will say once again that the proposed capital gains tax amendments for small business sound well and good. The minister can go out and say that we have delivered to the small business constituency that he purports to represent but, when you go to the finer detail and you ask questions about the relationship between capital gains tax rollovers and those businesses that are small businesses that operate as trusts in one form or another, will those same sorts of applications apply there?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day you have Treasury and the Treasurer and the Commissioner of Taxation wanting to protect the revenue&mdash;God only knows they have to with the partial backdowns that have come in during the last several weeks, whether it be for nursing homes or anything else&mdash;and they know they have to protect that revenue base because their projections for the future, whether there will be a balanced budget or even a surplus, are just disappearing before their eyes. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Ministers come in here all starry&hyphen;eyed at question time because they can see it all disappearing out the door. We have to ask several questions. Who will win out in this battle? Will it be a fair dinkum opportunity for small business to rollover the capital gains tax provisions, as was promised and as was outlined in this legislation? At the end of the day&mdash;because of other elements of the tax system and some future treatment of the trust issue&mdash;will that then capture many of those small businesses and see some of those proposed benefits disappear?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has already signalled that this particular piece of legislation will not be opposed in this place, but we have raised some concerns about it. I think the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) and others have made some reasonable comment about it. I conclude where the member for Curtin concluded; that is, it is regrettable that a piece of legislation that is so significant as this and so voluminous as this&mdash;both in terms of the actual bill and the explanatory memorandum&mdash;was tabled in this parliament last Thursday and was in this place for examination by Tuesday of this week. It is a not a reasonable expectation that members on either side of this chamber could give it a fair and reasonable viewing. Can I suggest, however, that when it goes to the other place that opportunity might well be taken and some of the difficulties that may emerge, particularly for small business, from this legislation will be examined in greater detail and perhaps even some changes recommended to it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are considering the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R353">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997</XREF>  and as was mentioned by the shadow minister, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), the opposition is not opposing these measures. Principally, it deals with capital gains tax rollover relief for small business and will extend capital gains tax small business rollover relief to the disposal of certain shares in companies and units in unit trusts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I think both sides of the House very much acknowledge the role of small business and would wish to encourage 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9987"> small business to the maximum extent possible, knowing only too well that employment growth is most likely to come from that sector. However, I must say that it is a matter of concern to me, and I would hope to the Commissioner of Taxation, that so much of small business is being conducted under the guise of trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I continue to make the point on this side of the House that PAYE taxpayers&mdash;that is, ordinary working men and women of Australia&mdash;really do not have the opportunity to minimise or avoid the taxation that they pay. They are happy to pay it. All they expect in return is that everyone else should pay their fair share of taxation. I must say that some serious doubts must be raised where you have family trusts for conducting business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another place you heard me say&mdash;and I was discussing the situation of child support with the honourable member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) on SBS, a measure that the Taxation Office has responsibility for&mdash;that child support really falls on average working men and women who are PAYE taxpayers. The great loophole in child support comes with those who are able, for taxation purposes, I might say, to quite legally minimise their income. Those particular women with partners who are able to minimise their child support, of course, have been sorely disappointed ever since the introduction of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a great pity that the universality of the scheme is under so much attack because of this particular loophole. They can transfer property and avoid paying child support, that is, transfer the ownership of property. They can engage in a whole range of things: by purchasing capital equipment, by incorporation and refusing to pay dividends, and taking a minimum salary for the liable years that they are required to pay child support. In that situation, the taxation department really does not worry if a person declines to pay themselves a decent salary or declare dividends because they realise that eventually there will be a disbursement of income. But, of course, it is a really critical matter, as far as child support is concerned, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that people be able to pay according to their real capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member for Gilmore would recall, I have said that it was a real pity that, in repairing the income base chapter of recommendations, there was only one that was picked up in relation to this group of people and that was in terms of property investment. We had a whole raft of recommendations dealing with income minimisation, including negative gearing and including transfer of property. We even recommended that, where the Commissioner of Taxation or the Registrar of Child Support believed that a parent was deliberately minimising their income, he could actually go back with penalties and increase child support assessments four years and seven years ago. It was pretty draconian and we were really trying to close that gap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Taxation do not like these sorts of measures of repairing the income tax base, because I can well recall that, when we were doing the Austudy inquiry and we wanted to make sure that people were not artificially minimising their incomes and allowing children to receive Austudy when ordinary people across the road were being excluded, they were very reluctant about that set of recommendations. I must say that I have now seen all of those recommendations effectively picked up. We used to call them the Volvo children, that is, the children that would be driving the family Volvo or driving a Volvo to university and claiming Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some concerns. I do not particularly object to the idea that small business men ought to be able to roll over capital gains when they sell a business and re&hyphen;enter substantially another business. I think that is to be commended. But I do have grave concerns when we start attacking the whole fairness issue of taxation. I believe that the issue of people being able to use discretionary trusts and family trusts, particularly in this small business area where up to 80 per cent of people are using such vehicles, says to ordinary men and women who pay their fair share that they are shouldering an unfair burden when other people can, in fact, minimise the contribution that they are making.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9988">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also addresses a number of other issues. One is a suspected $80 million scam in tax&hyphen;free personal computers and software. I have not had an opportunity to look at the measures to see how effective they are, but I think that all traders should be able to trade on equal terms. It appears that this scam is particularly having an adverse effect on very honest, smaller traders retailing computers and software.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is often accused of not being interested in taxation reform. We all know that the government's solution to a whole range of problems appears to be a GST. Before I get onto the GST, I think it is important that I put down on the record what we did in terms of taxation to repair the income base. The first thing that needs to be said is that, regrettably, the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard) has an appalling record, particularly when you recall the bottom of the harbour scams that were abounding that allowed people to avoid paying any income tax at all. This is the scheme that absolutely flourished when he was Treasurer and really only accidentally got uncovered when there was a royal commission set up to try to ping the painters and dockers. Little did they realise in setting up that royal commission that such a huge area of tax avoidance and evasion would be uncovered. We certainly had the record of trying to fix that mess up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But also we introduced things like&mdash;and I suppose we are quite used to it now&mdash;the fringe benefits tax. It was never the case that ordinary working men and women were able to take someone out to lunch and pay for the lunch and claim it as a tax deduction. But we all know that there were many executives who ran up a very high bill&mdash;not only for their clients; oft times it would be for their families&mdash;and were able to fully deduct the cost of the lunch and the entertainment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although we were told by the then opposition that we would be ruining the restaurant trade, ruining the hospitality industry, we brought in a fringe benefits tax. I have only ever had one regret about the fringe benefits tax and that is that, as far as the remote areas of Australia are concerned, we need to have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> another look at the impact of fringe benefits and, in particular, to take positive taxation measures, perhaps even over and above those which already exist, to encourage permanent populations in those remote areas of Queensland, Northern Territory and northern Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We introduced a capital gains tax, the very subject of this bill. People were able to trade in a whole variety of things. Perhaps shares are not the best thing to be mentioning this week but, if they traded in shares and made a capital profit out of that, it just went straight into the back pocket. Ordinary people were not trading in shares. They were not able to get this tax&hyphen;free income. If people were involved in buying and selling property in those years of high inflation, particularly during the term of the last coalition government, they were benefiting from what is called asset inflation&mdash;that is, they would own assets which would increase dramatically in value and, whilst there was no contribution to improving the asset, they were able to pocket that tax&hyphen;free benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have taken all of those sorts of measures&mdash;and broadened wholesale sales tax quite dramatically as well&mdash;to broaden the income base and to make the tax system fairer and more equitable. I do not think you, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, would argue and I am certainly not arguing that we have done all that needs to be done to make taxation fairer and more equitable. That is why the Labor Party is always going to be interested in the issue of taxation reform. Basically, we represent ordinary working men and women of Australia and we are proud to do that. As I have said earlier, they just do not have the opportunities to minimise income tax; they are always automatically shouldering their fair share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are always interested in reviewing income tax to ensure that others in the community are paying their fair share. For instance, the Taxation Commissioner himself has identified that the wealthiest 100 Australians are not paying something like $800 million in tax. I think that is $300 million more than was ripped out of funding for nursing homes. The wealthiest 100 individuals 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9989"> in Australia are avoiding $800 million in tax. As a priority we would be more than interested in examining that. We are always interested in seeing how multinationals, through transfer pricing, may be avoiding their fair share of taxation. It is disappointing when you look at the concessions that are available to business and you see the actual percentage of company tax that they finally pay. We would be interested in looking at those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for a GST, I always thought 1985 was the time to introduce a GST. I think it is a matter of regret that the business community did not support a GST then. Our approach was that we were always going to try to overcompensate those on fixed incomes. We have learnt the lesson of 1993 and we do not support a GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, in saying that, I would have to say that I would benefit very much from a GST because your salary, Mr Deputy Speaker, and mine are such that we do have scope for discretionary spending. People in my electorate are very honest, diligent, hardworking battlers. If they are raising families or if they are pensioners, they tend to spend up to the last cent of the income they receive. If you extend consumption taxes on goods and services, they are the very ones who will be most affected by a GST. For that reason, I think that they would be disappointed if they heard me speak in support of a GST. I do not support a GST, but I do understand that government members are very keen to introduce a GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My time is limited, so I conclude by saying that I do have some concerns about the specific nature of this bill, which I have expressed, and the wider taxation measures. Along with other opposition members, I will be supporting the passage of this bill through the House. We expect that it will receive closer scrutiny in the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R353">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997</XREF>  deals with a wide range of tax measures. Among them is a tax on personal computers and associated devices. This tax is designed to frustrate those who have been evading sales tax in these areas in the past and is calculated to ensure that some $80 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million of government revenue is returned to the Commonwealth. Those who seek to evade sales taxation in respect of computer products will now have to contend with a variety of rules and regulations designed to ensure that they are brought back into the net. To the extent that this is a measure to avoid tax evasion and avoidance, then the opposition supports it. I will certainly be returning to the detail of this matter shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it does raise a number of questions about government purchasing, because government also seeks to purchase equipment and it seeks to do so sales tax free quite naturally. Of course, there are provisions relating to that in this legislation. When looking at the purchasing of government computers we need to look more broadly than just at those provisions which relate to sales tax and which are covered in this bill. We need to also look at the way in which government organises its affairs so that it can in fact purchase those computers and the way in which those contracts are being specified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has recently embarked on a very substantial outsourcing undertaking. The government is seeking to outsource most, if not all, of its information technology requirements and to ensure that these are provided through the private sector. A certain amount of outsourcing in this context is reasonable. The previous government undertook that with the Veterans' Affairs contract. Of course, that contract was in place when this government took office. This contract has since been further used, or some might say abused, by the government in relation to its extension to the department of finance. IBM Global Services was the recipient of the original contract which is now to be used by the Department of Finance and Administration to include all of its computing requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was done and the contract&mdash;in fact, worth some $30 million&mdash;was awarded to a multinational, IBM, without any external tender process being undertaken. This is highly questionable when one looks at the competitive bids which might well have been offered in relation to that contract, given that this was a new department and a new area of undertaking. If the government was going to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9990"> extend this contract in the manner in which it has done, then it needed to seek fresh bids to ensure that the contract was in fact still competitive and that other people who may have had an interest in the provision of those services were able to tender for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, by extending that contract, the government has prevented any consortia within Australia who may have been interested in that contract from taking part in it. Australian companies have every right to bid for government work. I am sure that this is not a proposition which, on the face of it, the government would seek to reject. But, unfortunately, the way in which it has implemented its contracts and tendering procedures almost excludes, by definition, Australian based companies and they are couched in terms which almost presuppose that multinational, overseas based companies will be given the edge and that smaller Australian companies will simply pick up the crumbs afterwards. I think that the awarding of the Department of Finance contract in the way in which it was so awarded is indicative of this attitude which the government is expressing. Little, if any, attempt was made to ensure that Australian companies were able to take part in that operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we turn to the major part of the outsourcing program and look at cluster No. 3, which is the cluster which is first cab off the rank&mdash;the first one to be put out to external contract&mdash;we see that that cluster is very much under threat at the moment. Most of the former Department of Administrative Services, which fell foul of this government and has been subsequently dismembered, its minister having resigned, has ended up in the Department of Finance and Administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now widely believed and assumed to be the case that all of that work will be subsumed within the Finance&hyphen;Veterans' Affairs&hyphen;IBM&hyphen;Global Services contract. Again, a substantial chunk of what might have been cluster 3 will be subsumed in an existing contract without further offer of public tender, again excluding Australian companies. The reality is that what is now left in cluster 3 has been even more diminished by the news that the Corporations and Securities Commission 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will seek to enter into its own contracts and leave cluster 3. Thereby, the remaining package of work is diminishing by the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is yet to announce any plan to enable cluster 3, which is that first contract, as I have said, to be effectively tendered for by Australian companies. We have seen an industry development plan very recently announced by the minister which was a last ditch, last minute effort and a recent discovery by him of Australian industry and of the need for these contracts to encompass Australian industry. He has put forward an industry development plan which seeks to include Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have indicated, if you look in some detail at that industry development plan and at the package which is attached to these contracts you will see that it is intended and presupposed in that package that overseas companies will be the prime contractors and that Australian companies will be the subsidiaries&mdash;the subcontractors&mdash;that pick up the small contracts which are awarded by the multinational overseas companies to ensure that Australians win some part of the work, which they will do obviously for community relations reasons, for political reasons and to keep the government relatively happy about their bid. The reality of this is that absolutely no effort has been made by the government to ensure that contracts like cluster 3 are available for local Australian consortia to bid for. Its very process has ensured that they are not able to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has given no indication that Australian companies, if they were able to bid, would be given any special consideration or would be put in a position where their bid was feasible. If you look at the overhead of these contracts you will see that, to be a prime contractor, you would need to have an up-front cost of around $1 million to comply with the tender documents and to be in a position to lodge a tender. There are some 15 clusters. If you take $1 million a cluster for 15 clusters, you can see that very few Australian companies would be in a position to tender for any group of those clusters. Australian companies are effectively written out of the process by its very nature.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9991">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is well expressed by the Australian Information Industries Association in its recent public comments. The reason we have had to have the comment from the AIIA rather than from industry players themselves is that the government is so concerned about the nature of this tender process that it has been forced to gag the prospective tenderers. They have been advised that, if they speak out publicly in any way, they will be written right out of the tender process. That gag order is in effect against any of the industry players to ensure that they are not able to bring to public attention&mdash;to parliament's attention&mdash;the problems which are emerging with these contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIIA is paid by its members to represent their interests in the public arena, and that it is well able to do. For example, the AIIA called for a scrapping of the cluster by cluster outsourcing approach, which is effectively stacked against Australian companies, and suggested instead that a panel of outsourcing vendors would be progressively matched with the cluster of agencies in the one tender. The AIIA says that this proposal would be fairer, more cooperative, and have cost&hyphen;effective outcomes with Australian companies getting a better shot at the deals than they would with the staggered tenders approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That the tender process is stacked against Australian companies is quite clear, I suggest, from the evidence before us already and will become even more so as these contracts are awarded and one by one we see that they go to overseas companies and one by one we see that Australian companies again miss out, again are denied the opportunity even to effectively be part of the process. It is tragic that we have already seen one of those contracts effectively awarded to an overseas company without even a public tender, but we will not see that again. I am sure the government will back away from that method. What we will not see is a change to this government's outsourcing policy, because they are not prepared to amend their policies in a way which is Australian company friendly. We have seen that from their actions to date. I regret to say that we will no doubt see it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> again and again over the course of the next few months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These outsourcing contracts, driven as they are by the Department of Finance and Administration, have not had much in the way of an industry development component in them at all. The industry itself, not just those who are part of these contracts but other industry players, have been speaking out about this bias in finance department contracting procedures. For example Bruce Thompson, the Australian managing director of Hewlett&hyphen;Packard, which is a very well known international computing company, well respected in the computer game&mdash;they are producers of mini&hyphen;computers and personal desktop computer systems and calculators and known for their credibility throughout the industry&mdash;recently commented on the federal government's approach to IT policy and suggested that it lacked vision and clarity in its industry development approach. Rather than speak generally, I will quote the managing director specifically. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But there has been frustration that there has not been national leadership in any way, shape, or form with respect to the information economy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In quite a long discussion in a recent newspaper article, Bruce Thompson indicated the way in which he has fought an uphill battle with this government and its outdated industry policy and lack of leadership in the information industry. The information industry, as the Prime Minister has recently discovered, is very much a sunrise industry. It is a new industry. It is one in which Australia has some potential but one in which we have a massive deficit in terms of our import verses export of computers and communications products, a deficit which we should not be proud of, a deficit which this government should be working assiduously to recover from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, in relation to the major instrument which they have at their disposal right now, these massive outsourcing contracts which they are letting to the private sector, they are allowing this once in a lifetime opportunity to slip through their fingers in a way which will ensure that the minimal amount of domestic industry development 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9992"> occurs, that Australian industry benefits little from these transactions. If we are going to have outsourcing on this scale, and it is something which I would oppose on the scale this government is planning to do it, it is vital that Australia's national interest is protected while this occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not simply a contract for pencils; this is a contract of massive proportion, in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars as the years go by. This is a contract which will commit future governments, future communities, and the opportunity must be seized to ensure that Australian industry is able to benefit from it, that we address the problem of our IT trade deficit and that we build up Australian small and medium&hyphen;sized businesses to put them in a position to lodge even larger tenders in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we should rule out, as the government has done, the possibility of Australian involvement in the major contracts. I know there are Australian consortia who could tender for these clusters if only the government's rules made that a feasible proposition for them. They may still be able to make an effort in that regard but, the way the rules are stacked against them, I think they will find it increasingly difficult&mdash;and Australia will be the poorer for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to draw particular attention to some of the problems which I think will flow from the sales tax amendments. The reality is that this bill, as some of my colleagues have pointed out previously, was introduced in the House only last Thursday. We and industry at large have had very little opportunity to look at some of the very detailed provisions that are within it. That may have been the government's intention or it may simply have been that they were too late in getting this bill to the House. The reality is that these very detailed provisions about sales tax evasion will go through this House at least, although certainly not the Senate, without detailed scrutiny by the industry at large. Without the benefit of that industry advice, it is much more difficult for us to analyse these detailed provisions. In 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stead, to some extent we are required to accept them on faith from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, while some sections of the industry, particularly the retail sections of the industry, have generally welcomed this move because it will do something to address the sales tax fraud problem and thereby make their businesses&mdash;the businesses of honest traders&mdash;that much more viable as against those who would seek an unfair advantage through profiteering, through sales tax evasion, I am afraid that many measures in this provision could be criticised subsequently as the details come out. Again, the Australian Information Industry Association has published a detailed critique in relation to the sales tax changes, based on the early discussion exposure draft, indicating that they place the whole burden of rectifying this problem on those players in the industry who are already carrying their weight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the legitimate businesses who will be the ones who bear the full brunt of the administrative changes here. They will be the ones who bear the brunt of the added cost, the added form filling, the up&hyphen;front payments, the effective loans to the government of sales tax paid in advance. They are the ones who will pay that price and they are the ones who have already incurred the cost of having paid their sales tax honestly and openly, as all companies should but, unfortunately, only a majority do, leaving some $80 million a year still to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While they make a number of detailed points, which I am not able to address in the time this evening, they do make some points in relation to the need for a nationwide education campaign to explain to all concerned, both purchasers and retailers, the measures by way of newspaper advertisements, seminars and explanatory material from the ATO to ensure that retailers and the public are aware of their new obligations. They also point to the fact that Customs inspects only some two per cent of the goods that come over the Customs barrier in Australia and, therefore, the potential for continued fraud through misdescription of the goods remains despite this amending legisla 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9993"> tion. People will still be able to evade tax through that mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the bill itself, it seeks to define these things only in very broad terms and, indeed, in terms of the tariff classifications. But, as we all know, those tariff classifications are constantly subject to attack in the courts. They are subject to interpretation and reinterpretation, and descriptions such as personal computers, laptops, monitors, keyboards, printers are very generic and broad. I am sure that clever lawyers and shyster salesmen will be able to drive a truck through them, as they already do from time to time in relation to the general tariff classifications, and fraud will no doubt be possible on that basis. I am afraid the classification issue will be with us forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also a number of issues which need to be addressed in relation to leased computers where computers are leased by a company from another company on a short&hyphen; or long-term basis. The issues of who is responsible for the sales tax in that case, when that will be paid and how it will be paid have yet to be effectively addressed, as have the problems of the effective loans to the government which will be incurred in the up-front payment of sales tax and the fact that, if you are entitled to a refund, you will have to wait some time for that to come through. Indeed, I notice that the AIIA suggests that people should be eligible for a 105 per cent rebate from the ATO because of the additional costs and paperwork burden which they will face in complying with this new raft of measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the opposition supports anything which will ensure that prospective loopholes and actual loopholes in the sales tax legislation and taxation laws in general are closed effectively to the benefit of the community at large through government revenue and to the benefit of those traders who operate in compliance with the sales tax law, I am afraid that the government's measures here tonight are not a full answer to that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had we had the additional time that would normally be available for the scrutiny of legislation to be able to work with industry, to work with some of those honest retailers to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ensure that the government's measures could more properly address all of those issues, I am sure that this House could have done a better job of scrutinising the legislation that is before us tonight. However, that will no doubt be left to another place and the government will be accountable one way or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Arising from tonight's intervention, I would like to stress the need for the government to reconsider the outsourcing contracts and to ensure that Australian industry is able to take better advantage of the public money which the government is spending and generate jobs for Australians. We need an effective and appropriate information technology industry development policy&mdash;something this government has never been able to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to make some brief remarks on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R353">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5)</XREF>  and, in a sense, restrict my comments to one of Australia's greatest and oldest industries&mdash;that is, our minerals and resources industry, in particular our gold industry. As my colleague the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), the shadow minister for science and information technology, has spoken about new industries, I will speak about one of our oldest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of information technology industries, these are examples of Australians using great ingenuity, great research and development and great capacity for thinking at the leading edge. Just as this is true of the potential for our information technology industries, the same is true of our great minerals and resources industry, and it is true of our gold industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before coming to the implications of this bill for minerals and resources, I draw attention to the second reading amendment which was moved by my colleague the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), the parliamentary secretary for Treasury and taxation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9994"> matters. The second reading amendment which has been circulated and formally moved is in respect of those portions of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5)  which deal with infrastructure borrowings. The second reading amendment refers to extending eligibility for projects beyond the transport sectors into energy, water and communication sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a couple of brief comments about energy. The provisions of this bill which refer to infrastructure borrowings and infrastructure incentives effect the government's legislation to replace the previous government's infrastructure borrowing arrangements. Frankly, I regard that decision of the government to effectively terminate the infrastructure borrowing arrangements and restrict the legislation to the narrow area that it has, both in terms of subject matter and in terms of financial resources or capacity, as one of the most short-sighted decisions that the government has made. Coupled with its decision to reduce the 150 per cent research and development taxation incentive to 125 per cent, this is perhaps one of the worst policy decisions that it has made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply make the point that one of the great areas of potential for Australian industries, for Australian economic growth, for Australian prosperity, for Australian jobs, for Australian development, is to continue to enhance our areas of downstream processing. One of the keys to successful downstream processing is competitive energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is potentially on the brink of at last getting to a point in the cycle where we have international competitive energy. That is largely as a consequence of the prospective development of a whole range of natural gas projects, whether they are in the north&hyphen;west of Western Australia, central Queensland, South Australia or the Northern Territory. There is now a potential for competitive gas pipelines and competitive natural gas as an energy source to feed projects, to be an energy or a fuel feed stock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things required in the great landmass which is Australia is, of course, capacity for public and private infrastructure investment. The restriction of the govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment's infrastructure borrowing arrangements to a narrow area of roads and to remove energy infrastructure projects from its scope or capacity is, in my view, massively short&hyphen;sighted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having made that point, I would like to focus on that area of the bill which relates to schedule 5&mdash;`Technical amendments of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997'. It is the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 which I want to deal with this evening and in respect of which I have circulated amendments in my name for the consideration in detail stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is proposed that those amendments deal with page 77 of the bill as it currently stands, after item 34 in schedule 5. Those matters go to what is known as the old section 23(pa) in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. There is a relevant provision, which I am not proposing to disturb, which is found in clause 5 of schedule 7, which affects section 330&hyphen;20 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, which effectively corrects an error with which there is no difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In two respects, this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill brings into play and to the fore what we know in the minerals, resources and prospecting industry, particularly in Western Australia and particularly in the case of gold&mdash;although the provisions are not restricted to Western Australia, which would be unconstitutional, or to gold itself, but to a whole range of minerals&mdash;as the old section 23(pa). Section 23(pa) the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) would know about because this is a conversation we had when we were dealing with the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997  and was a debate that the parliament had in respect of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996. So it is not as if this is the first time this matter has come before this House or the parliament. In fact, there is a point that can be made here that the technical amendment which corrects an error I referred to in schedule 7 of the bill is actually the third legislative attempt the government has made to try to effectively implement a decision it announced in respect of section 23(pa) in the 1996 budget.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9995">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is section 23(pa) about? Section 23(pa) has the effect that the income derived from the sale of a miner's or prospector's right is not taxable. That was the original section 23(pa). That provision was examined in detail by Mr Gutman in the course of his report. Whilst on the one hand Mr Gutman recommended that income tax apply to income derived from gold production, on the other hand he recommended expressly the retention of section 23(pa) as an incentive to prospectors and explorers. There is a famous passage in the transcript of the Gutman report where it is drawn to Mr Gutman's attention, and to his surprise, that this is a provision which does not apply simply to gold but to a range of minerals, very many of which I drew to the parliamentary secretary's attention on the last occasion we dealt with this bill. At that time, I listed all the minerals in Tasmania which this provision had some relevance to over the years. I know that is a list with which you, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, are only too familiar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments which I moved to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 I repeat tonight in respect of this bill, although they are updated to apply to the 1997 bill. The effect of the amendments in short is as follows: the government's decision on budget night 1996 had the effect that the income derived from the sale of a prospector's or a miner's rights would be taxable from 20 August 1996, which was budget night of that year. This was met with massive consternation by the minerals and prospecting industry and, in the course of the last quarter of 1996, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced there would be a grandfathering for the sale of miners' rights up to 31 December 1996. So that was change No. 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996 bill sought to effect that change but, in the Senate, the bill was changed to impose a five-year grandfather clause with a valuation provision. So as a result of the Senate's treatment of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996, there was a five-year grandfather clause for the sale of a prospector's or a miner's rights, but subject to a valuation clause. That was technically 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> deficient so the government had to come back in 1997 with the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 . So strike two; then strike three and you're out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sought on that occasion to move a series of amendments which were rebuffed by the government in this House and effectively rebuffed by the government in the other place. This is the third occasion that the government has come back, because on that occasion it also made an error which  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997  seeks to rectify.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the thrust of my amendments? As it has always been, the thrust is to seek to ensure that an incentive for prospecting remains for the small prospector who has traditionally relied upon section 23(pa) and the taxation exemption provision that it has historically implemented. There are three thrusts to the amendments I have circulated. The first is to grandfather the tax exempt status of the sale of a miner's rights completely so that, if you were a bona fide prospector who held a miner's right as at 20 August 1996, the income derived from the sale of that subsequently is tax exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the alternative, if that is defeated and the government follows its consistent course of conduct of poking the prospecting industry in the eye, the second would allow for a straight five-year grandfather without a valuation clause so that the income derived from the sale of a miner's rights from 20 August 1996 to 20 August 2001 would be tax free. That effectively removes the valuation provision which the government has inserted as a result of a suggestion made by the Democrats in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third amendment is, in a sense, a technical amendment on the basis that, if everything else fails, to remove what I have described previously in this place as the very pernicious requirement that to remain eligible for the government's own income tax exemption arrangements you have to remain a prospector at the time at which you derive income. I will not rake through all the coals of those arguments because I have had the conversation with the parliamentary secretary before. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9996">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another qualitative reason why the government ought to adopt these amendments. If they found the arguments in favour of these amendments not compelling when the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997  fell for consideration, then they certainly call for compelling consideration now. That is because in recent days we have seen, as a result of the proposed sale by the Swiss Central Bank of 1,400 tonnes of gold following upon the attack on the sentiment of confidence in the Australian gold mining industry that our own Reserve Bank sell&hyphen;off caused, a further deterioration in the price of gold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the attention of the parliamentary secretary and the House to a couple of editorials that have emerged today which make the point that this second buffeting of Australia's gold industry is now going to go beyond the consequences that we have seen so far, which has been the cessation of projects. Whether it has been Western Mining's proposed $157 million St Ives development near Kambalda or the rationalisation of other projects, companies are suffering the consequences of as a result of the announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) of the RBA decision in July, to making life very difficult for exploration companies in the goldmining industry and particularly small time prospectors. This is picked up in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today in its editorial `Goldmines facing a poor future' which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  has noted previously that the Australian gold industry is moving to consolidate as companies realise that without a lot of gold&hyphen;bearing ground or access to large production volumes, they have a poor future. The end of the small goldminer is in sight: even more significantly, junior explorers which have been the future of the industry are likely to collapse.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Nothing could be more prescient. It is the case, particularly in Western Australia, that very many of the great goldmining developments that we have seen over the years have started as a result of the small time prospector in the Eastern Goldfields or the Yilgarn kicking over rocks, literally. Because prospecting and exploration is a high risk industry, one of the incentives that has traditionally been in place has been the incentive provided by the old section 23(pa). I have  not yet 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> learnt the section number of the 1997 legislation, because 23(pa) is emblazoned on my mind, as it is on the minds of anyone from Western Australia who has an interest in these matters. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  picks it up as well in its editorial of today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WA's gold industry faces the prospect of an extended period of low prices and this could reduce investment levels and threaten marginal gold producers and small prospectors. The Swiss move comes at a bad time for the industry as it faces up to a gold royalty to be introduced in the middle of next year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again the crystallisation, the prescient knowledge and understanding that what we are now doing is going one step further and adversely, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  puts it, threatening marginal gold producers and small prospectors. For the aficionado and for those whose staple diet is the goldmining industry, it is picked up by today's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kalgoorlie Miner</EMPHASIS>  where the Chairman of the Gold Industry Forum, Peter Lalor, refers to the market being driven by negative sentiment. He is also reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the mineral exploration industry could be hard hit with many mining companies re&hyphen;working their exploration programs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The thrust of the amendments that I have circulated is to reinstate a legitimate and valid incentive that small time traditional prospectors had to be out there in a high risk industry, prospecting and kicking over rocks, particularly in goldmining which has formed the basis of one of Australia's great exporting industries. What is not well understood by many members of this House and the community is that the goldmining industry in particular is not in the main made up of big companies or big projects; it is made up of small companies in small projects which are very diverse and scattered, particularly in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effects that we have seen in recent days will have very adverse consequences so far as small regional communities in Western Australia are concerned. One thing which this government can legitimately do is reinstate the incentive for prospectors and explorers, which even Mr Gutman, in precisely the same breath he recommended that income derived from gold production be taxed, recommended 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9997"> that this provision remain as an incentive because it forms part of the bedrock of the goldmining industry. I support the amendment moved by the member for Wills. I look forward to my usual robust discussion with the parliamentary secretary in the consideration in detail stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the members who have participated in this debate on <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R353">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997</XREF> . The Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), and one or two of the earlier speakers from the opposition alluded to the fact that there was a convention in this parliament that there be one week between the introduction of and the debate on any bill. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) pointed out that there was really never that convention. When I was in opposition I was amazed by the number of times the government delivered bills to us towards the end of one week and the shadow ministry had to give consideration to them on the Monday and then for them to be debated in the party room and debated in the House on the same Tuesday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no convention like that, and I totally reject the absolute nonsense that the Manager of Opposition Business spoke about in this House in regard to that matter. If there is any sort of convention on this, it is that at least there would be the opportunity for the caucus to meet, in regard to the opposition, or the joint parties, when the coalition is in opposition, to discuss the matter prior to debate in the House. That is probably a convention, but it certainly is not the one&hyphen;week rule. For the member for Hotham to come in here and take an unctuous approach is quite unbelievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a few other comments about business. I think it was the member for Hotham who talked about regional Australia. With respect to the Labor Party's record on  commitment to jobs&mdash;the member for Hotham was going on about the way in which they were going to create jobs&mdash;as a person who knows regional Australia very well, I can remember times in my electorate when unem 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ployment was 15.3 per cent and small business was paying 20 per cent in interest rates. I must say that, from my own experience in regional Australia, there has been a huge turnaround from that time. I want to refute quite strongly the lines which were put here by some members of the opposition in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to some specific areas, I would like to summarise the five measures that are involved. They are: changes to the capital gains tax rollover relief; measures to help combat sales tax computer fraud; an infrastructure borrowings rebate&mdash;which I will go into in much more detail a little later&mdash;changes to the Commonwealth rebate for apprentice full&hyphen;time training scheme, known as CRAFT; and minor amendments needed as a result of the rewrite of the tax laws under the tax laws improvement project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes to the capital gains tax provision mean that small business rollover relief will apply to the disposal of certain shares in companies and units in unit trusts. Currently, rollover relief is only allowed when certain active assets of a small business are rolled over and only extend the rollover relief for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the capital gains tax measures, contrary to the arguments put forward tonight by opposition spokespersons, rollover relief would be available to discretionary trusts if the net asset value of the trust does not exceed $5 million. Like other entities, such as companies seeking rollover relief, the net assets include assets of connected entities. These rules, applying to individuals, companies and partnerships, also apply to discretionary trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the sales tax provisions which were announced in the budget are anti&hyphen;avoidance measures designed to remove the ability for fraudulent operators in the computer industry to obtain goods tax free. The amendments will provide the Australian Taxation Office with a sound legal structure on which to base continued enforcement activity against these fraudulent operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a number of comments about the infrastructure borrowings tax rebate, and I want to talk about that in a little more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9998"> detail. One of the opposition spokespersons, the member for Melbourne, Mr Tanner, acknowledged that the infrastructure borrowings were being misused, and there is no doubt about that. I was looking through one of the examples of the arrangements, just to illustrate the point. Under these schemes, where there was eligible expenditure of, say, $100 million, through a whole range of different investments and diversions, it was ultimately being ramped up so that a tax concession of $150 million could then be claimed. Taxpayers are not expected to underpin financial arrangements whereby expenditure of $100 million is ramped up to appear to be $150 million so as to get a tax concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to infrastructure borrowings, the opposition has moved an amendment to remove the infrastructure borrowings rebate from the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997  on three key grounds: there is inadequate funding provided for the support of infrastructure, the legislation provides support for only a narrow range of projects and it is no longer an apolitical decision as to which projects qualify for the IB rebate, compared with an `independent umpire' of the Development Allowance Authority, which administered the old IB schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to inadequate funding, the government announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget that the cost of the IB rebate would be capped at $37.5 million in 1997&hyphen;98 and $75 million per annum thereafter, including administration costs. This equates to projects to the value of $2 billion. In addition to the IB rebate funding, the Federation Fund has been established to provide funding for a number of major projects of national significance in the lead&hyphen;up to the centenary of Federation in 2001. This fund demonstrates the government's commitment to regional development. A total of $1 billion in funding will be provided to projects which generate jobs in the construction phase and make a significant ongoing contribution to Australia and the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The imposition of a cap on the program is designed to ensure that the Australian taxpayer does not end up with a massive blow&hyphen;out in the cost of supporting infrastructure, as was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the threat with the old scheme. That particular illustration makes it very clear that there are people out there&mdash;well&hyphen;off people&mdash;who were able to make use of this. Quite frankly, some of them were able to get tax deductions so large that they were coming in under the limits for being able to get Austudy and those sorts of arrangements when they were earning well over $130,000 or $150,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The old scheme was not achieving its objectives, and there would have been a significant budgetary cost if all pending IB applications had been certificated. Benefits from the old concessions were increasingly being captured by financiers and high marginal rate taxpayers. Tax&hyphen;aggressive financing schemes were being proposed which would have resulted in an unacceptable cost to all taxpayers without a commensurate reduction in the cost of funding infrastructure projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If all pending applications had been approved under the old scheme in the then form, the cost to revenue could have been more than $4 billion over the three years 1996&hyphen;97 to 1998&hyphen;99. If tax aggressive schemes had been adopted in all cases, the costs would have been substantially higher. I think everybody in this House recognises that it is very unfair for people on the highest marginal tax rate who are able to participate in aggressive financing schemes to basically get over $4 billion out of other taxpayers. I regard it&mdash;and the government regards it&mdash;as totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation provides for only a narrow range of projects. The program will not only be open to road and rail projects, as the opposition would have the public think. It will also be open for applications for assistance with respect to private land transport infrastructure projects, project proponents who had an application in at the time the old scheme was closed off and extension of projects that had been certified to use IBs under the old scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Projects which were certified under the old scheme but whose certification was cancelled by the legislation will have access to benefits under the new IB rebate scheme. These projects are: the Redbank power station, the Oakey Creek power station, Parkeson power 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9999"> station and Raymond Terrace rubbish and sewage co&hyphen;composting facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government considers that the benefits of the rebate are best directed to the most pressing area of infrastructure needs: roads, urban arterial and railways. Significant social and economic benefits to the general community arise from the provision of such infrastructure. It is no longer an apolitical decision as to which projects qualify for the IB rebate. Our legislation ensures that the selection process is merit based. The selection criteria are spelt out in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As mentioned, the government has also decided to replace the tax exemption of payments under the CRAFT scheme with a budget outlay paid as a completion payment. This measure allows for transparency of government funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has mentioned the exemption for income of genuine prospectors from the sale of rights to mines. In response to amendments to be moved by the member for Perth, I make the following comments. The proposed amendments were debated at length in relation to the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997  and no amendment was made to section 333&hyphen;60 of the 1997 act. The Senate amended only the 1936 act provision, section 23(pa), and that section applies only to income derived before the 1997-98 income year. The government does not intend to reopen the debate on that issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we understand that. With regard to the tax law improvement program, a number of minor technical and drafting amendments are required. These changes have arisen as a result of the rewriting of the income tax act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I foreshadow that on behalf of the government I will be moving an amendment to the sales tax provisions. The first amendment corrects the cross&hyphen;referencing in item 25 of schedule 2 of the bill which deals with an application of certain provisions of the bill. Item 25 of schedule 2 of the bill, as introduced, provides that items 4 and 6 are to have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> application after 23 October 1997, the date of the introduction of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment corrects the cross-reference to provide that item 5, which relates to the dealings with part 7A goods, and item 10, which relates to credits in respect of 7A goods, have an application after 23 October 1997. I commend the bill, and thank members once again for their contributions to this debate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opposition amendments Nos 1 to 3 have the effect of completely grandfathering the provision in respect of the income derived from the sale of a miner's right as at 20 August 1996. The effect would be that, if you were a bona fide prospector on budget night 20 August 1996 and subsequently sold a miner's right and derived income from it, it would be tax exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a chance for Western Australian members of this chamber to stand up for Western Australia's prospecting industry. But I do not expect that anyone other than the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) might feel inclined to do that. I certainly would not expect the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) or the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) to do 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10001"> it. However, when this matter goes to the Senate, we might see Senator Lightfoot standing up for the prospecting industry. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on Saturday, 13 September 1997, Senator Lightfoot is reported as saying that `he is prepared to cross the floor to vote against the government's retrospective tax on mining leases'. When Senator Cook moves these amendments in the Senate on my behalf, Senator Lightfoot will have precisely that opportunity. That report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">WA Senator Ian Campbell, who is parliamentary secretary to the Treasurer Mr Costello, lobbied Democrats Senator Andrew Murray to vote against the last amendment put up by Senator Cook to ease the tax burden on prospectors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is when Senator Campbell was sprung&mdash;not only for not standing up for the Western Australian prospecting industry but also for actively working to their disadvantage. On 26 September, Senator Lightfoot wrote a letter on his letterhead to Senator Campbell which read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is still my unchangeable position, that the 23(pa) should stay <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">intacto</EMPHASIS>  within the present act. There are no possible suggested amendments that could replace that section, that will be either, revenue positive, or recreate the incentive for prospectors to add to the Nation's mineral reserves wealth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Lightfoot has crystallised the point well as an incentive for the nation's prospectors. This is even more important given recent events where the effect of the continuing fall in the price of gold will see severe pressure on Australia's exploration and prospecting industries. Senator Lightfoot went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">May I also add, that with the combination of Native Title, Diesel Fuel Rebate capping, the removal of 23(pa), the Western Australian Government's soon to be implemented Gold Royalty, a worrying number of miners are on their fiscal knees. As the Nation's biggest dollar earner, I am becoming increasingly uncomfortable with my Government's indifferent, even irresponsible attitude to the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If Senator Lightfoot thinks that the government is being irresponsible with respect to the mining industry, which it is, then he will have his chance in the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise the case of a constituent, who I will call Sophia, and the Westpac bank. Sophia was an employee of the bank&mdash;a teller. She took out a bank loan&mdash;she already owned a property in Lakemba&mdash;to purchase a property in Willmot, which she duly paid for. On three occasions, as an ordinary customer of the bank she went to the other side of the bank counter, filled out a withdrawal form and withdrew an amount of money, which went to provide the furnishings for the new house in Willmot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bank believed that the contract that had been signed did not allow Sophia to do this, although in the language of the contract it had a re&hyphen;draw facility. It is quite clear to me that if Sophia had been an ordinary customer of the bank the bank manager would have called her in and suggested that the purposes for which she needed the money could be accommodated by Westpac but that she needed to fill out an additional facility for that to happen. Unfortunately, Sophia was sacked by the bank because of these withdrawals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have written to the Managing Director of Westpac Banking Corporation, Mr Joss. I have not had the courtesy of a reply, which I feel only reflects the complete arrogance not only of that individual but of the bank. I have taken this matter up with the Ombudsman. I have had a hilarious response from the Ombudsman which says that the loss of a job is not an economic loss; Sophia has not suffered 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10004"> any economic loss and, therefore, he cannot intervene. Needless to say, I have taken that matter up again with the Banking Ombudsman and he is investigating the matter. I have also taken the matter up with Fay Lo Po, the New South Wales Minister for Fair Trading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this contract that was negotiated early last year had been completed after November 1996, then it is quite clear that Westpac would be facing charges and, I have no doubt, found absolutely guilty of breaching the national credit code and liable to a fine of some $500,000.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, indeed. Unfortunately, Sophia is one of those many bank customer victims who do not have the protection of the national credit code. Sophia has taken the matter to unfair dismissals. Whilst I do not want to get into that, I need to report that the registrar, notwithstanding that the bank refused to provide some witnesses to give testimony on oath, has found against Sophia. She is reluctantly taking it to appeal, even though the bank have written her threatening letters pointing out that they expect to extract in full their legal costs should she lose this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to thank the Ombudsman for his initial response. It brought home to me the need to review the effectiveness after six years of the Banking Ombudsman and the role he fulfils. I say quite frankly to the Banking Ombudsman that I expect him to conclude the case before the appeal is heard because, again, I have no doubt that he will have no alternative but to find in favour of Sophia: that the contract was never adequately or properly explained and that the bank, if not in breach of existing law, certainly were in breach of a lot of moral obligations that they would have to Sophia as a customer of the bank, notwithstanding the fact that she was an employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is ridiculous, given the fact that she was a teller and that she would have had many opportunities to improperly defraud or to commit malfeasance against the bank, that she is dismissed over making legitimate

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to members in this place speak about a variety of sporting teams they support in their electorates, but tonight I want to speak about a very different sort of team. The role and profile of this team is gathering support throughout the central highlands in my electorate of McEwen. In fact, as you drive through this region you will notice prominent red and white car stickers that say: `Part of the Team.' Walk down the main street of Seymour and you will see 80 per cent of all businesses, whether they be a florist, bank, shoe store, clothing factory or coffee shop, proudly displaying the same sticker: `Part of the Team.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a team like no other. There is no limit on the number of players. There is no limit on the number of supporters. It has no captain, CEO or chairman. It has no formal committee of management. It has no formal structure and there are no membership fees. Before describing to you who the team is and what it does to warrant such support, let me explain why and how this team came into existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several months ago the townships of Broadford, Kilmore and Seymour were dealt a severe blow when Amcor announced its decision to close its cardboard carton manufacturing plant at its 107&hyphen;year&hyphen;old mill in Broadford. As well as the deep emotional upset for those affected workers and their families, many of whom were third generation workers, the impact of this decision with several million dollars being withdrawn from the local economy was being felt by local small business. This decision came at a time when several local businesses had closed down and a decision by the government on tariffs and the TCF industry was imminent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The local media had reported these events and, not to put too fine a point on it, there was a feeling of pessimism permeating these communities. Two local Seymour residents, Richard and Louise Malouf, who have a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10005"> clothing manufacturing business, decided that they were fed up with such negativity being expressed locally and thought that there must be something they could do to change this. They realised that there was only so much that government could do and that communities reach a point where they have to decide what sort of future they want and how best to achieve that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They decided to write a story for their local paper to let others know their feelings. They wanted to put a stop to all the negativity. They then decided to see whether other local business people felt as they did. They held a breakfast meeting to which they invited about 30 people. To their surprise 65 turned up. They further discovered that these 65 people were just as concerned as they were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was at that point that the genesis of the team was born&mdash;born by a united realisation that all the talk of doom and gloom had to stop; born out of the realisation that while those 65 people were individuals with their own individual businesses they were also members of the same town, they were all part of the same community, and that if they supported each other, if they all worked together and took the time to discover what each other member had to offer from both a business and a community perspective and to find out about the products and services each had to offer, as a starting point, they would be able to encourage local reciprocal trading and the benefits of this trade would be retained in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many members soon discovered that they did not have to source a product or service in some of the large provincial centres or Melbourne but could actually fulfil their requirements from within their own community. The concept of this team approach has spread quickly. Not only do businesses proudly display their `Part of the team' stickers but they now use this logo in their business advertising. A team member takes responsibility for producing an article each week which describes a positive action or result by another member of the team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They held a second breakfast, and this time almost 100 people turned up. So committed are these people that they are now, with the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> assistance of the local Apex club, sponsoring a trade fair, which I have the honour of opening soon. They are working together with the local TAFE and have already run courses in improving customer service and better marketing techniques, including the use of the Internet, with more courses planned for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are also looking beyond their businesses where they are involving the whole community in encouraging families to join in developing a civic pride in their town by taking on the responsibility for local beautification projects, including turning disused areas like tennis courts into public gardens for use by families and visiting tourists. Team members now actively promote this self&hyphen;help method of turning adversity into opportunity into the surrounding towns of Kilmore and Broadford and even into the small towns like Warburton in the Upper Yarra area of McEwen. I too am a proud member of the team. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10005"><TITLE>Hostels</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a question tonight that is very important to my constituency and also has wider ramifications. In a lot of the discussion about nursing homes, I think sight has been lost of the plight of hostels. In my electorate of Fremantle there is a very worthy institution, the Italian Village, a hostel, which is a stand-alone ethnic specific hostel built in 1993 to provide a homelike environment for all of its residents&mdash;some 38 in permanent care and two in respite care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its very existence, as the local newspaper indicates, is under threat. Most of the residents in this hostel, as was intended at the outset, are from non-English speaking backgrounds. They are mostly from Italy, although they also care for people from the Netherlands, Greece, Croatia, Malta and some Australian born English speakers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only do they have very serious concerns about the prudential arrangements for accommodation bonds&mdash;and they have written to the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) in these terms&mdash;the residents' fee structures, which have been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10006"> somewhat modified in recent days, and the residency agreements but they wanted to draw to my attention, the minister's attention and this House's attention is the fact that a loss of government subsidy will jeopardise the very viability of their facility. That is not something that has been much discussed. It is the change in the assessment scales that must be discussed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen in the move from the existing Personal Care Assessment Instrument, which was to be applied prior to 1 October, to the new Resident Classification Instrument is a definite shift&mdash;and this will not affect only the Italian Village in my electorate&mdash;away from care, as they put it, which `respected residents' ethnicity, language and background, to a more, as they put it again, `non&hyphen;culturally sensitive approach'. In other words, they are being marked down. The weighting of communication and language in the scale is to be diminished. There is no doubt about that. I have established that by reference to others who are expert in this field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a board which does not know what they are talking about. Their estimates are that, with the number of residents they have, the total number of residents who will score over the 10.61 points on the new scale compared with those who scored over a similar hurdle (but different number) on the old will drop from the current level of 31 receiving a care subsidy to 15. The net effect of that will be to take $10,000 a month from their recurrent revenue&mdash;$120,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As they put it, the operational income for their facility is based, as it is in most cases, on two main sources: the residents' fees, which are at some point to go up in any case, and government subsidies. Again, as they put it, to take $10,000 per month from their operational income would leave quite a number of bills unpaid. This is a community and charitable organisation. They are&mdash;indeed as I am&mdash;very proud of the facility. A lot of the community have put money and effort into providing a high standard of care and personal assistance for these people whose first language is not English and whose cultural background is not Anglo&hyphen;Celtic.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In old age they have considerable difficulties with language, culture and food. Again, as is put in the letter to the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is very disturbing that so much community involvement could now be undone with a mere stroke of government legislation which will plunge our facility into such a serious financial predicament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They also point out that there is a growing sense of uncertainty amongst residents&mdash;where have we heard this? It is occurring in the nursing home sector as well&mdash;about ongoing fees that they will be required to pay as a result of the changes that have been announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facility has to find the money from somewhere. They will almost certainly have to charge residents of the community higher fees. They talked to me about a particular case of a gentlemen who was so anxious that his health declined very dramatically. As they put it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although we are not in the habit of discussing individual cases, we feel obliged to mention however that one of our residents has become profoundly depressed over financial concerns.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am sad to say that that gentleman died on the weekend. The situation, as they say, has been exacerbated by some of the media coverage but is basically the result of what has been undertaken by the government. The providers, as they say very clearly, were informed that these so&hyphen;called reforms of the government would be cost neutral. Instead, they find it is a cost saving exercise taking $500 million out. Finally, their plea is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What strategies (what miracles) must be put in place to make ends meet and to continue to provide quality care to our residents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a great shame for this community. It is the result of very short-sighted changes to an instrument which downgrades the importance of ethnic specific care to the very many migrants resident in seats and communities throughout Australia. I would urge the minister to change it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10006"><TITLE>Beaudesert High School: Sporting Achievements</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to bring to the attention of the House the achievements of two very special 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10007"> young ladies in my electorate of Forde. Katrina Hardke and Madonna Richardson were the first young people to achieve all three levels in the state's CAPS award in sports in Beaudesert Shire and in the sports leaders awards the first in Forde in gymnastics and one of the very small group of people in the state in all sports. CAPS awards sets the challenges, acknowledges the achievements and shows the pathways available in sports for those with leadership potential. I would like to place on record a little history of these two very special, delightful young ladies in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Katrina Hardke was born in Beaudesert and is a year 12 student at Beaudesert High. She is a young person with high aspirations and is aiming to make the most of life's opportunities that will come her way. Katrina was introduced to the sport of gymnastics at the age of five years and is still training and competing 12 years later. In that time she has been the club champion six times, represented the south&hyphen;east coast region at state championships five times, completed her coaching course to qualify as a level 1 coach and also passed her level 2 judges course this year by finishing top of the state in the judges examination. Although gymnastics is her main love, Katrina takes an active part in many sports, including hockey, softball, basketball, volleyball and squash and is regularly in the school's track and field athletics team and has represented the south coast region at the state championships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She was also a member of the Canungra tug of war team that won numerous state and national titles. Sport plays a big part of Katrina's life, though through her hard work and determination she has also done extremely well in the academic part of her life. She was awarded dux of the junior high school, received the district director's award and is currently achieving straight VHAs in all of her 12 subjects. She also writes the school sporting column for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Beaudesert Times</EMPHASIS>. Katrina also managed an impressive sporting involvement, at the same time not neglecting her studies. She is a very exceptional lady.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the year Katrina has been in CAPS, she has qualified in first aid work, events manage 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment and club administration. As well as her coaching and judging duties, she achieved all three levels of the CAPS program. The sports leader award is not easy to achieve and not many young people made it, but Katrina has done this in little over a year. It is a credit to her. With this sort of determination, I am sure she will go far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Madonna Richardson moved to Beaudesert in 1989 while attending St Mary's Primary School and joined the Beaudesert gymnastics club. Madonna was also a keen member of the under 10 and under 12 teams, played netball competition and represented her school and districts in athletics. She was house captain of her school and received the Vince Laura O'Reilly prize for the best all&hyphen;round performance in school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since attending Beaudesert High, she has done some remarkable achievements in sports. Madonna has travelled all over Queensland and overseas with her school and sporting clubs. Beaudesert High introduced Madonna to her favourite sports of vigoro and touch football. She participated in numerous state and national titles in touch football and travelled to Fiji, where her team won the Australasian championships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She has been selected in the Queensland Sportsgirl vigoro team and also as a representative of the Fassifern district. She represented her school in the south coast region in netball, squash, volleyball, tennis, swimming and soccer. Madonna received a very high standard of marks also in her school work and last year was the recipient of the principal's award. She is also very keen in debating and as a house captain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Madonna has achieved a number of Beaudesert gymnastics awards after being club champion. In 1994 she retired for a short time and then rejoined in 1996 when she returned to train as a coach. She won all of her achievements through the CAPS program in events management, club administration, sports health and passing level 1 coaching in May of this year. She also achieved all three steps of the CAPS awards program for her Australian Sports Commission leaders award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both young ladies are role models for the younger members of the Beaudesert gymnas 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10008"> tic clubs and pass on valuable experience in leadership, responsibility and personal development to junior members and coaches. Katrina and Madonna hope to continue to support and coach for Beaudesert for the next year while attending university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of myself and the Beaudesert community, I would like to record our very special thanks to Katrina and Madonna for their contribution to sports in the Forde electorate. The country's future is in great hands with Katrina and Madonna around. They have bright futures ahead of them and I wish them well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, Madonna, Katrina and I would like to also place on record our gratitude to John Gleeson, Beaudesert's gymnastic coaching director, for his patience, guidance and support in helping young people reach their potential. John gave a tremendous amount of voluntary hours to sport and is a valuable asset to our local community.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10008"><TITLE>Essendon Airport</TITLE>

<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a clear vote of no confidence by Victoria's Premier in the airport sale process 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> currently being undertaken by the Commonwealth Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey). It is noteworthy that the Premier of Victoria should have so little confidence in the process presently being undertaken that he should take that view. Perhaps he was cheesed off that Tullamarine airport did not go to his good friends Lloyd Williams and Ron Walker. Nevertheless, the fact is that he has expressed a vote of no confidence in the sale process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The second matter concerns statements made by David Corbett, who used to be a very ordinary, standard councillor with the city of Essendon, and who now lives some distance away in Griffith. David Corbett wrote to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS>  recently arguing that the operations at Essendon airport ought to remain. One of the reasons he advanced for this was that radioactive and infectious waste is buried at Essendon airport. When asked about this he said that he had been told by a former airport official that there was radioactive waste buried at the southern end of the airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you ask someone who is serious about these matters, for example, the Essendon Airport general manager, you will find that the general manager, Bill Coustley, will say that he is aware of these claims but absolutely unaware of any radioactive or infectious waste buried at the airport. The article reported Mr Coustley as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I don't know where that claim comes from," Mr Coustley said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"To the best of our knowledge that's not the case."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">David Corbett, from the safety of Griffith, is arguing for Essendon to remain with what are basically crank claims concerning Essendon airport, claims that have absolutely no evidence, no foundation whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I point out to the House that the government is engaged in a tendering process for Essendon airport on the basis that it retains its aviation operations. The airport has been a bottomless pit for the taxpayer. The average losses from 1971 to 1986 were over $10 million a year. So we have seen in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10009"> order of a $200 million subsidy to keep this unsafe and unwanted airport for the convenience of a few Victorians. If it is sold as an operational airport it may only realise some 20 per cent of its potential value, that is to say in the order of $100 million less than what it would be worth on the open market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in my view very difficult for the federal government to justify the sale of an airport that already owes the taxpayer millions of dollars, would require further subsidy, and would be worth many times more as an non-aviation  development. I would urge the government to revisit this issue of tendering for Essendon airport, noting that in the interests of the taxpayer it would be able to get a vastly superior sum to what it would get simply by selling it as an aviation concern if it were to put it on the open market to any and all comers.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10009"><TITLE>Breast Cancer</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to rise this evening to speak briefly on a subject which is of concern to all women in our society. Yesterday was National Breast Cancer Awareness Day. The subject is of great concern to all women; in fact, to everyone in our society. Breast cancer kills one in 25 Australian women. Currently, it is estimated that one in 14 Australian women will develop breast cancer in the course of their lives. Early detection in the treatment of breast cancer is critical. Data indicates that a five&hyphen;year survival rate for women diagnosed with localised breast cancer is about 90 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday I had the opportunity to attend an Australia Post launch of a new 45c stamp which is intended to help raise community awareness of breast cancer. This is the first in a series of stamps, which will be released over the next few years, promoting the awareness of the major health issues affecting the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, you may wonder why as a man I am speaking on this subject tonight. This obviously concerns all of us in our community and each of us, as partners to the women in our lives, have a responsibility to ensure that those women understand the risks and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> actions that can be taken to minimise those risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trauma of discovering a lump in your breast is not confined only to women. A surprisingly large number of men are troubled by lumps in the breast which may or may not turn out to be cancer. Many men undergo mastectomies or partial mastectomies to remove lumps in their breasts and, unlike the women in our society, there is a very limited support network for those men who do suffer from this affliction, which causes a tremendous amount of worry, a tremendous amount of questioning and a tremendous amount of heartache for those men involved and also for their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is unfortunately, very little support for the men involved and of course the macho image is that men do not need to seek assistance or seek support when confronting these sorts of issues, which I can assure you is a long way from the truth. I feel well qualified to speak on this issue as I myself some years ago suffered from the trauma of discovering a lump in my breast area and had to undergo a partial mastectomy to have that lump removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message I wish to convey to the Australian community, particularly to the men in our community, is that the issue of breast cancer, the issue of finding lumps and the issue of being ever vigilant against this sort of incident are not completely confined to the female of our species. Men should not be afraid to consult their doctor or to take action. I hope my speaking publicly tonight may give some men in our community the encouragement to know that the problem does affect some men and it should be dealt with quickly by medical practitioners. It is not one that should be whisked under the carpet as many men suffer a lot of pain and discomfort and hope that the issue will just disappear. I can assure the men in our society that the issue will not just go away and that there are a lot of men who do understand and are very compassionate about this difficult problem.</PARA>
