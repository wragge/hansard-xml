<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R312">Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Bill 1997</XREF>  and associated bills is to provide a legislative framework to facilitate the move from statutory to new company structures and operational arrangements for the Australian red meat and livestock industry. The new arrangements are a major step forward, advancing industry towards management of its own affairs and, importantly, increasing efficiency and competitiveness in structuring this industry to continue as a world leader. This reform is focused on the future needs of industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Background</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to improving the overall international competitiveness of all Australian industry. We are particularly keen to do so in our important agricultural industries. Unless we continue to improve productivity and cost efficiency throughout the food supply chain, we will lose ground against our international competitors and will not be able to maximise our national wealth, export opportunities and value enhancing potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The meat and livestock industry earns Australia, on average, about three billion export dollars per year. We need to set our targets for achievement at a higher level. As a single agricultural commodity export earner for Australia, red meat and livestock ranks third after wheat and wool. The potential of the industry is considerable. However, to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> realise this potential, we need to deal with a range of inefficiencies, including high costs in the processing sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, the Industry Commission inquiry into the performance of the meat processing industry confirmed the importance of achieving and maintaining improvements and competitive efficiencies. No&hyphen;one can contest these simple objectives. The commission found that Australia was not able to capitalise on its comparative production price advantage because the industry's processing sector was operating at significantly higher cost levels than the processing sectors of our major competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission, at the time it put forward its report, found that Australia was losing market share in almost all its major export markets. It is not just these barriers in the processing sector which are impeding the meat industry's capacity to be competitive in world markets, but other costs associated with Australia's labour market, waterfront, quarantine and meat inspection processes are also being addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members will no doubt agree that we must have a vision for the future and that reform in these key areas is vital to the long&hyphen;term viability of Australia's meat and livestock industry. This government is tackling these necessary reforms, and significant initiatives are already under way. For example, in the key area of industrial relations, the government has put the Workplace Relations Act in place and, as a consequence, award simplification test cases have been formulated for examination by a full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. One of the test cases includes the red meat processing industry and the particular issue of the tally system. The outcome of these cases will have particular importance for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response to the Industry Commission's 1994 report was the establishment of the Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry Act 1995 which allowed for some institutional restructuring, particularly in relation to priorities and policy direction. The act was designed to commence the process of engaging industry to accept a greater role in self&hyphen;determination. This bill, in effect, takes the major final steps towards em 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8846"> powerment by providing the industry with a structure which offers ownership and management of its own affairs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Review of current arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the end of 1995, it was clear that beef producers were suffering from the effects of a major drought and other significant international market factors which forced saleyard prices down to very low levels with consequential reduced returns to producers. Furthermore, other red meat producers and other sectors of the industry were also facing problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government instigated a review of the current institutional arrangements to determine whether early action might address at least some of the meat and livestock industry's problems. To that end, a joint industry and government meat and livestock industry reform task force was established in 1996. The task force reviewed the structural arrangements, the financial management and operational effectiveness of the present statutory bodies. It also pinpointed key industry policy and program issues for early action by government and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The task force found that market and industry circumstances had changed since the establishment of the Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry Act 1995. The task force found that the current statutory arrangements, which had worked well in the past, needed to be adjusted to deliver what industry required for the future. Prevailing and future commercial realities demand a structure which can deliver more flexible and focused commercial programs and operations. A sense of industry ownership and deeper involvement by levy&hyphen;paying stakeholders is also required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working from these findings, the task force report offered a wide range of recommendations based on two underlying principles. The first was that the meat industry in Australia must move towards a more self&hyphen;regulated, responsible and market driven operation. The second was that the role of government must move to one side, with a more clearly defined set of core functions for industry, while at the same time improving strategic alliances with and within industry for the delivery of these functions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also suggested that significant savings could be achieved by changing the current structures and levy&hyphen; funded functions and making the provision of services fully contestable and transparent to the industry stakeholders. Finally, the report advanced proposals for government on joint industry&hyphen;government policy and program actions. These proposals cover a broad range of joint actions that, in large part, cross state&hyphen;Commonwealth responsibilities and those of industry. Many aspects of these proposals are already being addressed by Commonwealth and state agencies in direct consultations with industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of recommendations were made on the need for uniformity in regulatory legislation and administration across Australia. A whole of government approach is essential to ensure an integrated and consistent basis for meat safety and other regulations and to provide a national regulatory underpinning for industry driven quality assurance and self&hyphen;regulation schemes. I intend to continue to advance these issues with my colleagues on the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand, ARMCANZ.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">New arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government decided on new arrangements following extensive consultations with all parts of Australia's vast and divergent meat and livestock industry. Full consensus has not been possible and is not possible. In an industry as diverse as this one, this is not surprising. I am pleased to say, however, there is broad agreement on major issues and each sector is in the process of implementing the changes sought. These included the need for a non&hyphen;government, commercially based organisation; the necessity for industry to manage its own affairs; a more hard&hyphen;headed approach to how levy&hyphen;payer moneys are spent; and separately accountable beef and sheepmeat marketing and promotion divisions and separately accountable research and development divisions, within a commercially based organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another key area of agreement is that joint industry functions, such as research and development, food safety and quality, market 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8847"> intelligence and market access issues, animal health and welfare, crisis management, eating quality standards, and Ausmeat should be dealt with cooperatively and collectively, and be adequately funded and serviced. The industry is now focused on their collective responsibility in scoping projects and programs within each of the joint function areas. This is fundamental and very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new structures will consist of a new producer&hyphen;owned service delivery company, limited by guarantee under the Corporations Law, to provide a range of services to the industry, including professional guidance. The role of the company needs to be recognised, more so than the fact that it will be producer owned. The company will replace the statutory authorities of the Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Corporation (AMLC) and the Meat Research Corporation (MRC).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The company will be accessible to all sectors within the industry in every sense, including service delivery, professional guidance and advice. All sectors will independently enter into contracts with the company for specific services. Importantly, the company will be a fully professional organisation which will be able to develop initiatives and proposals and advise industry and government on key issues. There will be separate companies, limited by guarantee, for the meat processors, livestock exporters and for the red meat advisory council, which I will discuss shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a memorandum of understanding between industry sectors and government to ensure cooperation in the overall interests of the red meat industry. There will be a commitment to the principles of a meat industry strategic plan and collective activities under genuine partnership arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is designed to free the industry from the legislative constraints imposed upon statutory bodies. The new, privately owned structure will allow industry to take appropriate steps towards:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Providing clear ownership by levy payers and non&hyphen;statutory contributors, and appropriate participation in decision making processes and resultant benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new arrangements will empower the industry peak councils to take leadership roles. The peak councils are expected to be as broadly representative of their sectors' interests as possible, bearing in mind that there will always be dissenters and detractors of any systems put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under voluntary systems, it is rarely possible to have full representation. Members of each sector should seek to make their views and concerns known to the peak councils. It is the responsibility of each and every participant of the industry to make their views known and seek to influence industry representation where appropriate. A requirement of what we are doing is that the relevant representative bodies be open to all views and embrace genuine representative responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Peak councils will carry responsibility for decisions on levels of levies and non&hyphen;statutory funding for the new service delivery company. They will be responsible, among other things, for the development of their sector's input into the meat industry strategic plan and for the implementation of that plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be able to effectively carry out the new responsibilities which will be required of them, the peak councils will need to be adequately funded so that they can have access to the professional expertise they will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8848"> require. A primary new source of funding for peak councils will be income earned from investment of industry reserves. We must approach this issue practically and sensibly, according to the needs and responsibilities of each sector or agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The `red meat advisory council', which may operate under another name, is primarily to provide advice to government on issues affecting the whole of industry. It is proposed that the advisory council be incorporated as a company limited by guarantee with directors being the chairs of each of the six peak councils who will be voting members, and representatives of the processor and livestock exporter companies who will be participants. It will also draw, as appropriate and when required, on advisers from government and other involved expert areas of the industry. The framework in which the advisory council will operate will be agreed in the MOU. Its functions will include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">advice to the minister;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">custodianship of the MOU and the meat industry strategic plan (the MISP);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">coordination and development of, and assessment of performance against, the industry strategic plan;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">being the trustees (within a deed of trust) for industry reserves currently held by the statutory corporations, and ensure the investment of these moneys by a reputable and reliable trust fund manager;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">administer arrangements to fund peak councils including the distribution of funds (from investment of reserves) to peak councils;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">provide an interface for resolving sectoral differences or problems in a way which does not adversely affect industry but in a way which promotes the image and purpose of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terms of the council's custodianship of the industry reserves will be determined jointly by industry and government. The principal requirements will be that the funds be used for the benefit of industry as a whole, be managed transparently in a manner consistent with an industry developed strategic plan, and be based on accepted commercial prac 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tice. It is envisaged the returns on investments would be used primarily to fund peak councils and, in a small part, to defray the costs of running the council.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Levies, charges and other funding</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under present arrangements, industry levies and charges primarily go towards funding the industry's three statutory bodies&mdash;the ALMC, the MRC, and the meat industry council. Other agencies which receive funding from industry levies and charges include the National Residue Survey (NRS), the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC), the National Cattle Disease Eradication (NCDE) program and the Australian Animal Health Council (AAHC).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new arrangements, contributions will be sourced from various industry sectors, either on a statutory or a non&hyphen;statutory basis. The collection of statutory levies will still be based on the present system but with changes allowing for a transaction levy on sheep, lambs and goats to replace the livestock slaughter levy previously paid by processors, and a separate transaction levy component on grain fed cattle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The transaction levy approach for sheep, lambs and goats was adopted at the request of a clear majority of industry whose submission met all of the requirements of the government's levy principles. A similar request was also submitted by the grain fed cattle industry sector for a separate cattle transaction levy. Again this submission met each of the government's levy principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing levy and charge imposition acts have been modified to provide for clear sectoral ownership. Processors and livestock exporters will contribute on a non-statutory basis. To accommodate the non&hyphen;statutory nature of the funding, the now separate processor and exporter levies will be set at zero, provided these sectors meet their share of whole of industry obligations under the new arrangements. There will be no changes to current levy rates until the new arrangements, including formal agreement on the nature and extent of processor and livestock exporter contributions, are fully in place and contractually deliverable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8849">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should the non&hyphen;statutory contributions by processors and livestock exporters fail to meet agreed funding levels for joint industry functions, and as specifically agreed by these two sectors, the government has their prior agreement to maintain levies at a required level to ensure that there is adequate funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The buffalo industry sector has chosen to use RIRDC to meet its collective research and development programs and will not be contributing to the new service delivery company. Separate levy legislation will provide for direct buffalo industry sector contributions to RIRDC and continued contribution by this sector to the NRS and NCDE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will continue to match industry R&amp;D commitments. Matching funds will continue on a dollar for dollar basis on eligible expenditure up to the maximum matching of 0.5 per cent of the industry's gross value of production. However, to qualify for matching funding for levy monies, contributing groups will need to meet specific eligibility criteria.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">MOU and deed of grants</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill recognises that much of the prescriptive detail for flow of levy funds and management of reserves will be set out in a deed of grant. The deed of grant will be implemented between the government and the producer owned service delivery company. The deed will set out the conditions upon which levy monies and matching funds are passed to the company and how those funds may be applied. It will also set out the minimal accountability requirements that enable me to meet my responsibilities under the Audit Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The MOU will primarily be between industry peak bodies and also the government. Where appropriate and where they have identified responsibility, the service delivery company and other entities will be required to be signatories. The document will consist of a statement of principles and supporting schedules clearly outlining the new arrangements to which industry sectors have agreed. It will also outline intended joint function areas, core function areas and set out the guiding principles for the operation of the red meat advisory council.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Assets and liabilities</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In consultation with industry and appropriate central commonwealth agencies I will determine the most appropriate placement of the assets and liabilities of the ALMC and the MRC. The legislative provisions to effect the transfer of such assets and liabilities to private companies is provided for in the  Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the industry reserves will be transferred to the new service delivery company to offset liabilities which exist at the time of transfer and to meet start&hyphen;up capital requirements. A full due diligence exercise will be conducted for accountability purposes to ensure all assets and liabilities are identified prior to transfer. Start&hyphen;up capital will also be provided to the processor and livestock exporter companies. I will, in consultation with industry, determine how the balance of reserves will be used to benefit the industry as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Role of government, ministerial powers and accountability</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of government in the new arrangements will be minimal, but will remain necessary while taxpayer monies are involved. Ministerial powers of intervention and mechanisms to guarantee appropriate standards of governance and accountability to parliament and levy payers will be retained through the combination of legislation&mdash;including the Corporations Law&mdash;regulation, appropriation, deeds of grant and the industry MOU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth will not be a member of<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS>any of the new companies, nor will it have board representation or carry any liability in relation to their operations. The government will, however, continue to fulfil its responsibility. The government will also continue to assist industry through working to ensure the economic framework provides for a genuinely competitive environment and that the global trading environment does not disadvantage our competitive advantages. The government will continue to maintain a strong presence in areas of food safety and hygiene, research and development, industry adjustment processes, training and education delivery, market access 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8850"> negotiations, competition and contestability, workplace reform, and infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Legislative provisions</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislative package consists of this, the principal bill, and sixteen associated bills. The principal bill makes provision for some staging by proclamation of implementation. This is critical because many of the mechanisms which will underpin effective and efficient industry management, the creation of representative corporations, the development of industry contractual arrangements and negotiations by industry leaders, must be completed before the current legislation is repealed and levies adjusted. These activities are well advanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation provides for the continued management of existing export licences, export quotas and enforcement powers. At present these functions are managed by the ALMC and paid for by levy payers. They will now transfer to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, including the provision for full cost recovery for the administration of licences and quotas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provision is made in the bill for the secretary of DPIE to have regard to policies formulated by prescribed industry bodies when exercising licensing and quota powers. Provision is also made for levy funds for marketing and promotion activities and R&amp;D functions to flow to the new service delivery company. There is also provision for the government to identify those organisations which, after meeting prescribed conditions, will be recognised as eligible donors for the purpose of Commonwealth matching funding on eligible R&amp;D expenditure within the service delivery company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal legislation makes provision for ministerial direction, but only in situations of emergency and where the national interest is involved. The power of direction is limited to matters for which the Commonwealth has authority under the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new structural arrangements impact directly on other legislation, including the meat industry's present levies and charges acts. The  Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry (Repeals and Consequential Provi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sions) Bill 1997  makes provision to repeal or amend relevant parts of the affected acts. In addition, a new set of levy and charge bills has been drafted to accommodate the change to the nature of future contributions. The changes are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">the Cattle Export Charges Act 1990 will be replaced by two new cattle export charge acts which deal separately with producers and exporters. This allows for subsequent reduction of the export sector levy components to zero when that sector delivers on its funding commitments under the new partnership arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">the Live&hyphen;stock Export Charge Act 1977 will be replaced by two new livestock export charges acts which deal separately with producers and exporters. This will also allow for subsequent reduction of the export sector components to zero.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">the Live&hyphen;stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964 will be replaced by a Live&hyphen;stock Transactions Levy Act and a Live&hyphen;stock Slaughter (Processors) Levy Act to allow for the separation of producers' and processors' funding and for the processors' funding to move to zero levy rates.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">the particular requirements of the buffalo industry will be met by new buffalo export charge and slaughter levy acts. Separate levy acts are needed because the buffalo industry will retain slaughter levy and export charge arrangements. Contributions from the buffalo industry will continue to go to RIRDC, the NRS and the NCDE as at present.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">the Beef Production Levy Act 1990 will be amended to allow for the processors' funding to move to zero levy rates.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">the new act replacing the Cattle Transaction Levy Act 1995 will provide for the imposition of separate levy components for grass fed and grain fed cattle producers to support their individual contributions to the new service delivery company, as well as continued funding to the NCDE and AAHC.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">a revised set of national residue survey bills has been included in this package to allow for continuation of the provision of produc 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8851"> er linked payments on cattle, buffalo, sheep, lambs and goats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all cases, the promotion, marketing, R&amp;D and program specific components will be specifically identified. Provisions will ensure collections of levies and voluntary contributions relating to any particular sector will be clearly and transparently identifiable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Collection arrangements and cost recovery for these levies will remain as they are at present.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">National eating quality standards scheme</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have long promoted the need for a proper meat grading system in this country. I expect the new service delivery company to maintain the high priority being given to the early introduction of the proposed national eating quality standards scheme and further expects funding for this initiative to be of a high priority for the industry sectors. As they say, if you like to eat, you are involved in agriculture. One thing that we really can do that will benefit the consumers of this nation and beef producers&mdash;or meat producers of all persuasions&mdash;at the same time is to ensure that we have in place a mechanism which means that the consumer can be reassured as to the eating quality of whatever it is that they are purchasing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Support for producers' marketing initiatives</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have asked the new service delivery company to give careful consideration to ways to assist groups of producers who wish to pursue various marketing initiatives. Such initiatives  would include the development of brands and the development of niche markets and a means by which innovation and initiatives can reap rewards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to repeat that the legislation package I have just outlined will facilitate the reshaping and refocusing of the Australian red meat and livestock industry. The new statutory arrangements will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">empower industry;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">reduce government involvement;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">encourage the development of systems and structures which promote the culture of industry cooperation and a sense of corporate behaviour in developing and ensuring the future prosperity of the Australian red meat industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These new arrangements represent a radical move to industry self&hyphen;determination. The changes will be carefully implemented to ensure that structures, relationships and operations are corporate in their nature and have proper and workable settings and control measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the announcement of the government's decision, industry has had time to appreciate the historic opportunities being offered to it and acknowledged that the package will accommodate most, if not all, of what the various sectors  have been seeking. All sectors have assured me that they accept the decisions taken and that they will get behind them to ensure their effective implementation. Above all, industry has recognised that the new arrangements are offering a  necessary opportunity to bring about a fundamental cultural change. Rather than relying on government involvement and legislated instruments, the package offers industry control and ownership of its own destiny. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of this bill is to impose levies payable by producers on transactions involving sheep, lambs and goats. This bill will replace the levy imposed on the sheepmeat and goat industries by the Live&hyphen;stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964, which provided for levies at the point of slaughter and was paid for by processors. The levies will be used to fund the new industry service delivery company, disease eradication and animal health for the sheepmeat, wool and goat industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of decisions taken for processors and live exporters to move to non&hyphen;statutory levies, and for reasons of simplicity, equity and transparency, the Sheepmeat Council of Australia and the Goat Industry Council of Australia proposed a transaction levy be introduced in lieu of a slaughter `pass&hyphen;back' levy. The Sheepmeat Council of Australia has demonstrated this is clearly the majority industry decision, including support of this approach by the Wool Council of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The transaction levy under this bill will closely parallel the existing transaction levy that has operated successfully in the cattle sector for many years. By aligning industry collection mechanisms with those already existing for cattle, meat industry levy collections are effectively standardised. It is this standardised approach that has assisted in gathering strong support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes provision for exemptions in such circumstances as are prescribed by regulation to provide the flexibility in the future to cater for industry decisions in relation to levy exemptions. Such regulations will be disallowable instruments and the industry, in seeking levy exemptions or concessions, will need to clearly demonstrate that the proposal has majority industry support and meets all the requirements of the government's levy principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sheepmeat Council of Australia and the Goat Industry Council of Australia have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> requested an exemption from levy for sheep, lambs and goats sold for $5.00 per head or less to cater for cases of genuine hardship.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I rose to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R309">Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill</XREF>  I was sitting here contemplating the terrible damage that has been  done by Sydney airport to the people in my electorate and to the people of my previous electorate of Grayndler. I was first elected to public life in 1971 as a councillor on Marrickville Council on a policy of reducing aircraft noise. It is appalling that 26 years later I am still in parliament talking about the atrocious effect that Sydney airport has on the people of my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, that airport was never really planned. When it became the principal airport for Sydney, no&hyphen;one looked ahead to the day when air transport might be the usual way of moving people between Australian cities and overseas. Nobody looked ahead and nobody listened to the growing complaints of residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This lack of interest can largely be attributed to one factor: the residents of the suburbs around the airport were, for the most part, working class. They did not carry the weight of being in marginal seats. They did not have access to the media. They were not the rich and powerful. The airport kept growing and evolving and the planes kept getting bigger and noisier and, unfortunately, far more frequent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The growth of a very centrally and conveniently located airport was in the interests of all who could afford to use the facility and in the interests of the owners of airlines and the bureaucrats responsible for building and maintaining the airport. This very powerful lobby group won hands down every time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The airport only emerged as a major issue once the planes became of such a size and frequency that they started flying low over suburbs which were of upper or middle class. These people had access to the media and lived in marginal seats. Suddenly the noise 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and pollution became an issue and suddenly governments started focusing on the problems caused by Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not expect miracles and the people of my electorate do not expect miracles. There is no expectation on my part or, I think, on the part of most of my constituents that Sydney airport will one day be packed up and taken away and that the site will be turned into parkland or a marina development. Indeed, many of my constituents work at the airport. It is a very significant local employer and should remain that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what the people of my electorate do expect is a fair and just outcome for the noise and pollution that they have put up with over the years. I speak particularly of my current electorate and the residents of the suburbs of Earlwood and Kingsgrove, who are suffering under the new flight path regime instituted by the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot gloss over the decision of my own party to construct the third runway at Kingsford Smith airport. I was vocal in my opposition to this decision as were a number of other Labor members whose electorates surrounded the airport. That decision, however, was carried out with the full support of the then opposition, the now government. The current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, were the ones who were saying we should expand Sydney airport and we should do it quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They fully endorsed that course of action until it became obvious that the optimum flight paths for using parallel runways at Sydney airport would take the traffic over their electorates. What a turnaround! From espousing the virtues of a third runway and even being supportive of raising the airport curfew, the Liberal Party and its members of parliament went full circle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the time the election came around we had the Prime Minister saying to the electors of Lowe, `If you vote for Mr Zammit'&mdash;the current member for Lowe&mdash;`you will have no more aircraft noise. If you want aircraft noise, you should keep on voting for Labor's candidate. If you want your property values to go up, you should vote for Mr Zammit.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8859">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the people of Lowe took the Prime Minister on his word and they voted for Mr Zammit. They believed the Prime Minister when he said that there would be no planes flying over the electorate of Lowe under a Liberal government. They were sucked in. The Prime Minister has not stopped the planes flying over Lowe. But I do note that he has stopped them flying over his own electorate&mdash;self-interest will always out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has just moved the noise around so that more people suffer from the effects of the airport. Those suffering at the moment include the residents of Earlwood and Kingsgrove in my electorate who now have a great many flights skimming over their rooftops any time from 5.30 a.m. until midnight seven days a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more alarming to all those people living around Sydney airport was the decision to go back to basics over the location of a second Sydney airport. For over 20 years we have been looking at a site for a second Sydney airport. The Fraser government in the long distant past instituted the major airport needs of Sydney inquiry to look at where we should have an airport. Finally, after the Labor government made the disgraceful decision about the third runway they decided on Badgerys Creek as the preferred site for the second airport for Sydney as part of that package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without any forewarning after the last election, particularly to the voters of Hughes, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development suddenly dragged out a Holsworthy option and put it forward as a possible airport site. This sop to a group of Liberal Party supporters and the Lawrence Hargrave project delayed yet again any real progress towards a second Sydney airport. It was another red herring thrown into the ring to distract anyone who was interested from the real game&mdash;the game of getting a second airport into the Sydney region and thereby ameliorating the effects of aircraft noise and pollution on the people of the inner west and south-west of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, a few weeks ago the government came out and confirmed what everybody already knew&mdash;Holsworthy was a stupid 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposition and Badgerys Creek was the only viable site left in the Sydney region for a second Sydney airport. This was the position we had come to in the Labor Party many years earlier. Badgerys Creek will provide a solution for the increasing problems with Kingsford Smith airport that is just and fair to all Sydneysiders. It will also, like Kingsford Smith, generate a great deal of employment where it is needed out in the western suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in the same way that justice delayed is justice denied, the delaying of the construction of Badgerys Creek will deny the people of my electorate and those surrounding Sydney airport any hope of an improved quality of life or even a halt to the deterioration of their current quality of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we await a longer term solution, Kingsford Smith should be managed to ensure that the least possible noise and pollution to the fewest number of people is achieved. One key aspect of such a management plan is to limit the number of take-offs and landings to ensure that there is not continued growth at Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plan put forward in the  Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997  simply revisits the proposals in the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill 1996, which was put forward in this House last year by my colleague the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and me. The member for Grayndler and I proposed a cap on aircraft movements of 80 movements an hour into and out of Kingsford Smith airport. This would hold traffic at Sydney airport at around its current levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of course would tell you that such a cap is not necessary&mdash;those people who advocated the third runway and those people who advocated lifting the curfew. They believe that the airport should be utilised to its limit&mdash;and that limit is being talked as being up to as many as 120 movements an hour, two movements a minute, one movement every 30 seconds. They also suggest the lifting of the curfew. The more bizarre of them even suggest a fourth runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These same people are quick to advocate no second airport for Sydney. They seem convinced that, if they keep ignoring the prob 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8860"> lems associated with Kingsford Smith airport, these problems will go away. They are happy to see the difficulty experienced by those in the inner west exacerbated by increasing the use of this site, which I might say is one of the smallest site areas of any large international airport in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without some artificial limit being placed on the number of aircraft movements, there will be no pressure to address the real aviation needs of the Sydney region. Already we have seen the projections passed that were made some five years ago about when Sydney airport would saturate. With the exponential growth that you are seeing in this country&mdash;both international tourism into and out of Australia, and the attitude of Australians of moving around the country via aircraft rather than via cars, buses and trains as people used to do&mdash;there is going to be more and more demand on Sydney airport. The deregulation of the airline industry put in place by the previous Labor government has seen aircraft fares reduce and come within the range of ordinary working people. This has seen the use of aircraft skyrocket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet another set of short&hyphen;term fixes would be put in place if the people who have the attitude that Sydney should get bigger and bigger are the ones who win. There is a real danger with the approach to the 2000 Olympics&mdash;when the facilities at Sydney airport will be pushed to the absolute limit&mdash;that people will say, `We have coped with Olympics. Let's leave it there and let's do nothing.' If the government had shown some leadership on this issue rather than dangling the Holsworthy red herring, which is something that amazed everyone, we would have seen a start on the facilities at Badgerys Creek and probably seen them in place to deal with some of the overload in the year 2000. But we saw nothing. We saw the government cause 18 months of delay once again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of my constituents, the people of Watson, I support this legislation wholeheartedly. I think the government should have been a little bit more generous and dealt with the legislation of the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and me last year, or indeed done what the minister said he would, which was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> introduce legislation last year to do just this. But better late than never. This legislation will go some way to assisting the residents of the electorate of Watson, and particularly those of the suburbs of Earlwood and Kingsgrove, to at least maintain some standard of comfort rather than have it further eroded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the government should not stop here. The government should announce that it will be starting work on a second airport at Badgerys Creek immediately. If the government was fair dinkum it would provide an injection of funds from the Federation Fund to kick&hyphen;start this project and thus assure the people of Sydney an aviation infrastructure capable of taking them into the 21st century and reassure the people of my electorate their problems will not continue to escalate. If the government has money available to build a railway from Adelaide to Darwin then surely there should be money for a genuine infrastructure program which will be used and of benefit to Australia rather than a bit of cargo cult for the voters in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Enough is enough! The government must get on with building Sydney's second airport. This legislation goes some way to at least making that a more urgent matter because, by capping the movements at Sydney, we will ensure that people have to focus on the future rather than continuing to have ad hoc decisions at Sydney which will cause that airport to get bigger, noisier and nastier. It would be stupid, as I said earlier, for any member who represents the airport to say that it should be closed. It is a very significant generator of work for the people of my electorate and I have never argued that Sydney airport should be closed. We should tame this beast, and we should tame it now, but we should ensure also that the work that it provides stays there for the people who live around it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think that those people out in the western suburbs who were originally proponents of Badgerys Creek, and have now all of a sudden become opponents of it, should start to think about the people that they represent who need jobs, as well as the nimby approach, because as the Mayor of Liverpool has said, Badgerys Creek airport will become the single most significant generator of jobs 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8861"> in the western suburbs of Sydney that we have seen in the last 50 years. It will provide work and it will provide work for ordinary working&hyphen;class people, which is what is needed out in the western suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we must tame Kingsford&hyphen;Smith. This legislation goes some way to doing it. I commend the government for that, but I condemn the government for taking so long to get to this piece of legislation. I condemn the government for not starting on Badgerys Creek yet. By condemning the current government I also do not give any comfort to my colleagues who held this project up either. The previous Labor government was wrong in building the third runway. The previous Labor government was wrong in not getting a start on Badgerys Creek, although it did make the final decision to build the airport, and it did acquire the land. The current government has sold a large site adjacent to the airport which will make it very difficult to keep up with some of the plans that should occur at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude my remarks, this legislation will at least say to the people of my electorate that the beast has been tamed a little, and there will be some certainty put back into their lives. I could make some remarks about the government's phoney program of sharing the noise, but I do not think that is all that constructive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just complete my remarks by picking up on a matter regarding the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit), who the government has sold out with great distinction. The member for Lowe, in his remarks, mentioned a stunt he got up to by writing to all the local councils and members about his press release. All I will say to the member for Lowe is: stop the stunts, get out there and try to exercise some influence on your government. You got elected on the phoney promise of no planes over Lowe. When there are no planes over Lowe, then he can hold his head up high. He has been sold out by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), he has sold out his own people and all he can get up to is stunts. I think that probably shows about the level of the member for Lowe.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R309">Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997</XREF>  delivers on another commitment that has been made by the coalition. Certainly we accept the support that we have been receiving from members of the opposition, although I noted there has been a little bit of a division in the opposition camp with regard to the development of Badgerys Creek. I acknowledge the contribution of the member for Watson (Mr McLeay) in support of that option and would say in defence of the government's actions on the EIS process that at least we did that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went through that rigorous EIS process with Holsworthy to make sure that the decision to exclude it was a justifiable decision and to make sure that the decision on Sydney's second airport was justified on solid grounds. We can move forward now to the completion of that process with Badgerys Creek. In listening to the debate last night, I noted that there is still some division between some members of the opposition with regard to the proposal to build Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek, but I note the very positive comments of the member for Watson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill that we are debating is a delivery of a coalition commitment. It provides certainty for operators. Everybody knows what is going on. It establishes a maximum limit on aircraft movements at KSA to 80 movements per hour while introducing a slot management system. I suppose in discussing these matters everybody has their own individual concerns and most of them are born out of representing their constituencies. The opposition speakers we have been listening to obviously have strong feelings one way or the other. We know that the development and management of the KSA airport has been a very vexed issue for the Labor Party and the seats around it. We heard the member for Watson say that he never agreed with the establishment of the parallel runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a representative of regional Australia I, too, was keen to see in this slot management system an acknowledgment of the important role that regional airlines play in New South Wales. I understand that they have been given 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8862"> a regional airline slot pool, which has been introduced in this bill as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition are complaining about the time it has taken the government to make more progress or to get the development of a second Sydney airport started. The Labor Party in government had 13 years to tackle this problem. They could not sort it out internally. It is public knowledge that there are concerns from some of the members in the government about the EIS process with Holsworthy, but the decision was taken as soon as the results of the EIS were out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government promised to open the east-west runway if elected to government. We have done that. The government promised a more equitable distribution of the aircraft noise problem. We have done that. The government promised a review of the flight paths for Mascot airport, and we have done that. In opposition the coalition was committed to capping aircraft movements to 80 per hour and in government the coalition is implementing this promise. Eighty movements an hour equates to approximately 500,000 movements per year. This is in excess of Sydney's 353,000 movement limit which is specified in the long-term operating plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, 50 per cent of the movements were over the suburbs north of the airport. These residents never got a break at all. The coalition has already cut these movements by 33 per cent. The target is to cut it further to around 17 per cent. Under the coalition, 17 per cent of aircraft movements will be to the north, 15 per cent to the west, 13 per cent to the east and 55 per cent will be to the south and over water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is being done here is exactly what we set out to do&mdash;that is, to create a more equitable situation not only for the movement of aircraft in and out of KSA but also for the distribution of noise. We are a government that has inherited a problem that we are dealing with. To be criticised for not dealing with it more expeditiously, I think, is a bit disingenuous of the opposition. There has been positive action to deal with the surrounding suburbs around KSA in an equitable way. We have put those measures in place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The slot system is the means by which the cap can be monitored. The implementation of the slot system will be beneficial to all users of the airport. It is designed to alleviate congestion in a non-discriminatory way. While the bill sets out the general framework for the slot system the detail, to be determined by the slot manager, will be contained in a disallowable instrument. The slot system will be fully operative by March 1998. The slot system is consistent with worldwide practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The slot management system is used at approximately 130 airports around the world. The system being implemented in Australia is based on the IATA model with some modifications that reflect the particular conditions that exist at KSA&mdash;for instance, as I alluded to earlier, protection for regional services, better access to slots for new entrants, and the introduction of compliance mechanisms. They are all important elements of what we are attempting to achieve here, and I think it should be recognised. It is important to recognise the right of those regional operators to also have access to KSA. All those commuters have an expectation and a right of quick access to the business community in Sydney and should not be penalised because of their smaller aircraft. It is an important element of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The slot system forces airlines to move away from cluster scheduling where flights are scheduled to arrive and depart and are beyond the capacity of the airport to support. Cluster scheduling can be claimed therefore, particularly at peak times, to be the root cause of the delays experienced at KSA, which is the flip side of the problems. It has been criticised over the years for the low number of hourly movements in comparison to international standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 80 movements per hour is not presently being met at KSA. There will be opportunities for new entrants to obtain slots during all operational hours. This includes peak times. There is a general expectation that there will be a degree of competition for any slots available during peak periods. Potential new entrants will have equal access with their established competitors on a fifty-fifty split. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8863"> KSA is one of the fairest airports around the world in this area and is consistent with a deregulated aviation industry. At most, other airport incumbents get first go at the slots available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill establishes a slot manager, which is envisaged to be a company formed by Sydney airport and Australian airlines or operators using the airport, which will administer the allocation and compliance. As I have already noted, special arrangements are going to be put in place by the government for regional airlines. We are committed to providing services to regional New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The needs of regional New South Wales will be preserved by the use of ring fencing whereby KSA regional airline services have their own slot pool. Existing regional services will be guaranteed a regional slot. These slots cannot be sold or swapped to interstate or international services. So that is locking in the opportunity for continuity of regional services in and out of KSA so they do not get elbowed out, so to speak, by the larger operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be difficult to put a cap on aircraft movements without some sort of effective compliance mechanism to ensure that it was not abused or misused in other ways. This is the crucial element of the slot management system. The aim is to promote efficient scheduling performance. There will be steep fines for non-compliance. Delays at KSA will be now more open to scrutiny as the slot system introduces a clear set of criteria for flight movements. The maximum penalties are fairly hefty&mdash;for a no&hyphen;slot movement and an off&hyphen;slot movement, the penalty is $220,000 and $110,000 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A no&hyphen;slot movement is the most serious breach, and it jeopardises the cap and disrupts other airport users who have applied for a slot. So, if you have an airline operator who just does not turn up, does not utilise the slot they have been allocated, it means that someone else has missed out, the whole schedule has been put out of whack. That is how critical the timing will be in the operation of the slot management system. To make sure these companies and airline operators are focused on what is trying to be achieved here, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the compliance measures will be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is a government of action, unlike Labor, which did nothing but create anxiety and stress for the people of Sydney for those 13 years. I note that the member for Chifley (Mr Price) is in the chamber. I do not know whether he has actually spoken on this bill.</PARA>

But you can rest assured that this government will deliver on alleviating the problems as far as the second airport in the Sydney basin is concerned. We will not be vacillating on this the way the Labor Party has done.

This is just another one of those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It took a long time for them to try to address the problem with the parallel runway at KSA. They went through the process of identifying Badgerys Creek.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you may be aware, the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) thought he was launching some vicious attack on me in purporting to make some great revelations to the House about statements I have made in this place in support of Badgerys Creek. For the record, I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> think the most nerve&hyphen;racking time for me as a new member in this place was talking to my party units who had had a history, dating back to Galston airport, of being opposed to an airport in western Sydney and my advocating that we should in fact look at having an airport in western Sydney. In 1985, in looking at the way things have developed, an airport for Badgerys Creek was, in retrospect or hindsight, a 1980s issue.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HOCKEY" NAMEID="DK6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DK6">Mr Hockey</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You went to the last election with it.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course. Just let me finish. I think you will find that I have quite a bit to say. In western Sydney it is true that an overwhelming proportion of the population supported an airport at Badgerys Creek. I have some sympathy with the comments of the member for Watson, who said that it is a pity they did not get on and build it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that the proposal started off as a general airport. The runway was extended to allow a certain class of aeroplane to use it but not all aeroplanes. Indeed, I well remember the comments by, I think, one of the state premiers at the time, who said that Badgerys Creek would only be required, looking at airport demand, in the year 2010.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have certainly changed my position. I make no apology for that. Indeed, it is not something new to my constituents or new in the western suburbs of Sydney. But what is the reason for me wanting to change my position on Badgerys Creek?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I think it is fair to say that the proposal for the third runway and the flawed EIS at the time not only disturbed a lot of people in the inner city but started to raise doubts in the people of the western suburbs about the efficacy of an airport at Badgerys Creek. I remember a number of meetings that Labor members from the western suburbs of Sydney had during 1995. There was complete agreement that, when we went into the next election&mdash;that is, the 1996 election&mdash;the three studies that we had promised would be completed, the flight paths would be available, there would be a high degree of community consultation and every citizen would know exactly how that airport would actually affect them. History shows of course that this was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8865"> not done, and I must say that it left people like me well and truly isolated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already referred to a meeting at Memorial Hall during the election period, which I was genuinely informed the member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, was invited to attend. For the record, Jackie has said that she was never invited and I accept that. But we did have the former Senator Woods come along. Do people remember Senator Woods, of travel rorts and a few other things?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did former Senator Woods say at that meeting? He said that the coalition stood for an open, transparent and publicly accountable EIS process. More than that, as the inner city community groups had been funded by Labor, the relevant groups in western Sydney would also be funded by the coalition. Have we had an open, transparent and accountable EIS process? Of course we have not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other speakers have referred to the Holsworthy episode, fiasco, whatever you want to call it. I thought it was really interesting that, as part of upholding this open, transparent and accountable EIS process, we suppressed the information which would allow us to examine what led the government to abandon Holsworthy and refine down its sole solution to Badgerys Creek. Does the honourable member for North Sydney believe this is accountable, open and transparent? He really does swallow the government's propaganda lines to a degree that I did not think was possible.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LEE" NAMEID="MG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr Lee</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has been part and parcel of it.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the shadow minister is obviously correct there. He has been part and parcel of it. But let me just talk about noise. I think there was nothing more criticised in the third runway EIS than the use of Australian ANEF standards. They were totally discredited. But what standards are we using in the Badgerys Creek EIS? The very same standards. Even by the time of the last election, people in my part of western Sydney knew that 24 hours was never going to be a goer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have issues of air quality. It is true&mdash;and the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) will confirm this&mdash;that in western Sydney we have an extraordi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> narily high incidence of asthma. That affects not only people of my age but, of course, young children. What do we have in terms of fine particle pollution in the EIS? There is absolutely no mention of the US standard of 2.5 microns. That is not mentioned in the EIS at all. Why should I raise that? That is the fine particle pollution that lodges and remains in the lungs of people who come in contact with it. I hope that the new fine particle pollution standard currently being negotiated by the federal government with the states does include a 2.5 micron standard because I think, of all things, this alone probably will rule it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EIS does not address ozone pollution. Is the honourable member for North Sydney not concerned about ozone? There is the issue of the remaining stands of the Cumberland Plain woodland and, of course, the 31 endangered species that are in the flight path of the proposed airport. Also in the EIS are the figures that show, under the various options, the dramatic decrease in the value of houses to people. For an airport that is alleged to traumatise cows only, it is surprising that the barn value is going to drop by as much, under one option, as $61 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for North Sydney probably does not even flinch at $61 million, given the value of houses in his electorate. But I remind him that in western Sydney these houses represent the life savings of battling families. This is the way we have traditionally saved. People's prized assets&mdash;their family homes&mdash;are going to dramatically decrease in value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said all along&mdash;and I have sometimes been criticised for it&mdash;that, since the change of government, the real people who are capable of influencing the government on this issue of Badgerys Creek are not the member for Greenway, although he has always been in that fight, or me or even the member for Prospect, Mrs Crosio. The real keys to Badgerys Creek are the government members like the member for Lindsay. What is her position on Badgerys Creek? We cannot quite work it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, Danna Vale left us in no doubt about where she stood in relation to Holsworthy. Apparently, options A and C are not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8866"> acceptable to the member for Lindsay, but she apparently has no problems with option B, although she has already conceded she may very well lose her seat over it&mdash;and I think that is right. There is Kerry Bartlett, the member for Macquarie. What is his position? My understanding is that he will go with the flow, whatever the government decides, or whatever the member for North Sydney instructs him to say. We are offering a reward for the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) on what his position is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I make no apology for saying that I will respond to what I see are the needs and aspirations of my constituents. That is a bare minimum position for any member. Yes, it is true, I have changed my position on Badgerys Creek.</PARA>

In fact, all opposition members not only support the bill but also understand what led the member for Grayndler and the member for Watson to take the initiative on this matter that has led to this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in western Sydney regret what a lot of constituents have had to put up with in electorates surrounding Kingsford Smith airport. I say with great respect that no member really is entitled to say to us in western Sydney, `Well, you know, you've got to put up with noise pollution. You've got to put up with pollution.' We are not going to cop it. Prevailing attitudes to airports have changed. Whilst I believe it is an urgent necessity to seek relief from Kingsford Smith airport, I am not convinced that Badgerys Creek is a solution in the 1990s and beyond.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am certainly pleased to support the principles embodied in this <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R309">Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997</XREF> , given that it arose from a private member's bill moved by me in this House and seconded by the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay). All I can say is that it is about time. It is about time that this government started to make some genuine decisions and progress about Kingsford Smith airport and what it will do about the hundreds of thousands of residents that are affected by its ever increasing noise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government characterised by prevarication, delay and an avoidance of making the tough decisions. The delay in this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8867"> bill is symptomatic of the lack of leadership from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that we have seen on a range of issues. Ever since the coalition came to government, it has been delaying action on the Sydney airport problem. Despite Holsworthy being a clearly unsuitable site&mdash;coming second last in the last EIS process&mdash;the government set up a process so as to delay the decision about the second Sydney airport for yet another year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite clear election promises to introduce a cap of 80 movements an hour, the government did not raise the issue until this month, 18 months into office. It took a private member's bill from the opposition to put this issue on the agenda. For a whole year, the government has tried to avoid having a debate on my private member's bill before this House. Its delaying tactics take a toll not only on the credibility of this government but in more real ways on the people who have to live under Sydney airport's flight path. These people have been kept waiting over this period by this government's indecision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I first made the demand for a cap in my private member's bill, the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill 1996, which was introduced and had its first reading on 4 November 1996. The second reading was on 18 November. After the government failed to respond to this challenge and decided to delay the decision, I made repeated calls for the cap, including in the grievance debate on 10 February 1997 and in a speech concerning the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 on 18 March 1997. On 19 June 1997, the member for Watson and I tried to suspend standing orders to bring on the debate regarding the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill. I raised the issue again in the debate on the  Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  on 26 June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why were we so concerned about pursuing this? Because Kingsford Smith airport accounts for 49 per cent of all passenger traffic in Australia, and this level of passenger traffic is on the increase. In 1965&hyphen;66, 2.6 million passengers passed through this airport; in 1995&hyphen;96, 20.3 million passengers passed through the same airport. This figure is expected to double by the year 2009, with an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> estimated 40.4 million passengers expected to pass through Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, residents who live around Kingsford Smith airport experience up to 753 aircraft movements per day. By 1999&hyphen;2000, they will have to experience an average of 866 aircraft movements per day. Added to this, as we all know, Sydney airport&mdash;and my electorate&mdash;is surrounded by the most densely populated urban area of Australia. A recent Airservices Australia report stated that the number of people living in the 20 ANEF contour range has increased from 68,380 to 116,860. That is over 100,000 people per day putting up with a substantial level of aircraft noise. By and large they are not the people on the far North Shore of Sydney, I might remind my Labor colleagues; by and large they are working people in inner city electorates who have voted Labor their whole lives. That is why we need a solution to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt aircraft noise will continue to increase until a second Sydney airport in the Sydney basin&mdash;which is the only place it can be&mdash;is built. Kingsford Smith airport, of course, is continuing to expand. This government's decision to delay the building of the second international airport has also been taken in a period when they have supported the expansion of international facilities at Kingsford Smith airport. Ironically, the decision to expand KSA has been the only decision the government has made with regard to the airport issue that has not involved delaying tactics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 19 June 1997, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works announced that the international terminal at KSA should be upgraded at a cost of $350 million. On 29 August 1997, Senator Robert Hill, Minister for the Environment, concluded that an EIS for the expansion of the international terminal at Kingsford Smith airport was not required. So I say to my colleagues on both sides of the House: let us not have any of this nonsense about people being concerned about people around the inner city and not being concerned with Sydney West; we are getting an expansion of facilities and an expansion of flights without an EIS. Interestingly, however, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8868"> Public Works Committee noted in their final recommendation that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any further development of Sydney airport should have appropriate environmental clearances before being referred to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In that, the Public Works Committee is clearly stating its dissatisfaction with the government's crash&hyphen;through approach on this issue.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee was clearly concerned about subjecting the residents around Sydney airport to increased noise and pollution, even if John Sharp and Senator Hill were not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also noted that, because no decision had yet been made on the location of a second Sydney airport, the expansion of KSA had to occur. Why has a decision not been made about the second Sydney airport, despite the commitment of the government, prior to the election, to build a second Sydney airport, despite the fact that there was an obvious growing need for a second Sydney airport and despite the fact that the previous Labor government had already allocated $306 million for airport development at Badgerys Creek, $21 million for a control tower and firefighting services, $23 million for environmental safeguards, $480 million for roads, $17 million for a rail corridor and had already spent $152 million on land acquisitions around Badgerys Creek?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite all this, what we had was a delay in the EIS process because of the Holsworthy fiasco. That delay has meant an expansion at Sydney airport. We all know that Holsworthy was never seriously a contender. It had already been considered and knocked over. However, the government proceeded with the sham and told us all it considered Holsworthy a potential site. The government was becoming famous for its delaying tactics when, in the budget of 20 August 1996, it allocated $21 million for the EIS for the Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy second airport options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the draft EIS was released, of course we all knew that Holsworthy had been excluded, but at a cost of delay to the second Sydney airport, at a cost of an ever increasing expansion at Sydney airport and at a cost of millions of dollars to the taxpayer. We are now back at the point at which we were in March 1996. All this has achieved is the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> alienation of thousands of people in south&hyphen;western Sydney around Holsworthy airport. How can we trust this government's commitments to solving the problem at Kingsford Smith airport when the only real, concrete action we see is the expansion of facilities at Kingsford Smith airport?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issues which have come before the Sydney Airport Community Forum&mdash;chaired by the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey)&mdash;unfortunately have also been ignored by this government. We have seen the movement of the threshold on the third runway where a clear decision by the Sydney Airport Community Forum was knocked over by the previous Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the long&hyphen;term operating plan proceed. I do not argue that everything in the long&hyphen;term operating plan is bad, because clearly it is not. Clearly, aircraft noise has been an ever increasing problem over decades at Sydney airport, and clearly no government, Labor or conservative, can say it has a proud record on these issues, because I do not believe any of them have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that the main problem I see with the long&hyphen;term operating plan is the number of take-offs to the north, which it clearly favours, rather than take-offs to the south. They are clearly favoured for one reason and one reason only: if a plane takes off to the north, it can veer to the west all over the western parts of my electorate, the Ashfield municipality, and all over the electorate of Lowe whereas if it lands from the north it has to fly over the electorate of Bennelong. It seems to me that the priority of this government has been to protect the residents of the North Shore of Sydney at the expense of the residents to the immediate north of the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a number of other issues brought up by the Sydney Airport Community Forum which are yet to be addressed. There is the issue of those people closest to the airport. I say to the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), who spoke last night about the terrible noise that people in Turramurra suffer, that those same planes are a hell of a lot 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8869"> lower when they are over Sydenham than when they are over Turramurra. And hearing is not related to income. People who cannot afford to live at Turramurra&mdash;they would probably like to but have to live in weatherboard houses in Sydenham&mdash;do not have different hearing from the people in Turramurra. They are the same planes; they are just 10 times noisier when they are over the residents of Sydenham and St Peters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for North Sydney and others to their credit have visited Sydenham and shown a genuine sympathy for the residents around the Sydenham&hyphen;St Peters area. I congratulate the member for North Sydney and thank him for his efforts on behalf of those residents which I believe have been very genuine. But the fact is that the residents of Sydenham are still waiting for two major questions to be answered. They are waiting to hear about the issue of those people who are living in weatherboard houses which cannot be insulated. They live in weatherboard houses because they are living in the suburb with probably the lowest income in Sydney. The average income is certainly a lot lower than the electorates of Prospect or Greenway. They have the cheapest houses in Sydenham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure honourable members that in the inner west housing boom that is going on prices are not increasing in Sydenham and St Peters. What is happening is that the houses cannot be insulated and they are just being left as a result of the government's failure to make a decision. The government should make a decision regarding those residences. We have a buy&hyphen;out program that has been approved unanimously by the Sydney Airport Community Forum and those residents deserve certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot over the last couple of days about the government's commitment to small business. But I say to Peter Reith or anyone else in the government, `Go down to Sydenham, just as Lindsay Tanner, the shadow minister, has done twice since the election and have a look at the boarded up shops there.' If you acquire a whole suburb of 151 houses, you knock them over literally&mdash;demolish the houses&mdash;and you are left with a park, it is not surprising that the newsagent, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the chemist and the local stores all close; and those people deserve compensation. Yes, the Labor Party acquired those houses and, yes, that was a great program, because you cannot leave people living in an over&hyphen;40 ANEF noise zone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former minister showed his ignorance of the issue. Perhaps he should have come down to Sydenham. I invite the member for Lowe, Paul Zammit, to come down. I am sure that I can organise one week living in Sydenham in one of these houses free of charge for any MP or adviser on the other side of the House. I will even give them TA&mdash;which the government is concerned about&mdash;out of my own pocket to live there for a week and argue that those houses should not have been demolished and that people should not have been given compensation and allowed to live in first world conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night I was amazed that the member for Bradfield praised the former transport minister for the personal time and effort he had put in in visiting the people of Pymble. The member for Bradfield said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite his extremely busy schedule&mdash;and, despite. . . the very secure margin of Bradfield in . . . returning a Liberal member&mdash;he was even prepared to see individual members of my electorate who were concerned and on the verge of psychological despair over airport noise.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dear, dear! The people from Turramurra suffering from psychological despair. In 18 months the former minister did not come to Sydenham, my electorate or to the area which is most affected. The shadow transport minister, two visits; government, zero. I ask whoever the incoming transport minister is to come to my electorate, sit down and talk to the people there and experience what the noise is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to people on my own side of the House, to Labor members, or any other MP who supported the third runway, `Come and stand in Yelverton Street, Sydenham and tell me it was a good decision.' And none of them have. All the economic rationalists from whatever side of politics cannot defend the decision to build the third runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude by talking about Sydney West airport and the need for it to be built. I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8870"> want to quote the report of the New South Wales Labor government's Standing Committee on Public Works, chaired by Paul Crittenden. It is a great report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on State Infrastructure Requirements for Sydney West Airport</EMPHASIS>. In the executive summary it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SWA offers Western Sydney the opportunity to secure a commercially viable international airport with an associated commercial/industrial complex that will complement and reinforce other economic development catalysts planned for the region. These projects represent a strategic infrastructure network that will significantly enhance the region's competitive base, create jobs and provide opportunities for residential development in the SWA Sub-Region.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This report outlines the measures needed to ensure that the environmental impact on residents of Sydney West are minimised. No&hyphen;one who lives in or represents the area, no&hyphen;one who has experienced the trauma of Sydney airport, is about repeating the exercise or transferring the problem to Sydney West airport. It is important that there is a proper EIS and that the problems are not repeated. I support the residents of Sydney's western suburbs in seeking to ensure that the chaos around Sydney airport is not repeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do need to get a bit fair dinkum about this debate and to point out that the members around Sydney airport are not saying, `No aircraft noise.' That is the lunatics in the No Aircraft Noise Party. We are not saying, `Shut Sydney airport.' I have never said that. It would be opportunistic and I would be probably get a bigger swing if I did say that. But I am not saying that, because it is unrealistic&mdash;just as it is unrealistic to argue that Sydney does not need a second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, it is worse than unrealistic to argue for airports at places like Goulburn and Williamstown, because that means an expanded Kingsford Smith airport. There is only one option, and it is now Badgerys Creek airport, as we have argued since the election. To give one figure from the draft EIS, the maximum number of people who will be living in the 20 ANEC range around Badgerys Creek is 3,000. There are over 120,000 people around Sydney airport. Compare apples with apples and not apples with oranges. What we need to do in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> terms of Sydney West airport is ensure that the mistakes are not repeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that the member for Bradfield suggested, in quoting me out of context from an article, that I had said: `Only a Labor or a Liberal government could fix the problem.' I did say that during the election campaign, because I do not believe that the No Aircraft Noise Party or independents can solve anything. I am a big political party person, and I believe that only governments, not individuals, provide real solutions. He quoted me out of context, but he did not mention who wrote the article. It was Chris Falvey&mdash;John Sharp's adviser. So he has quoted it as an independent source. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;It was a fascinating evening last night and has been an even more fascinating morning. Those people listening in the gallery today would wonder whether indeed the ALP supported this <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R309">Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997</XREF> . I can tell them that in actual fact they do, which may well surprise them, given the nature of the debate. Indeed, the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), said that it was a good bill. I congratulate him on that, but I will not be congratulating him on much else that was said during the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing that needs to be remembered in this debate is that we went to the last election with a policy of a cap of 80 movements per hour and, as with every election promise that we have made in relation to Sydney airport, we have kept to it. We have developed an agreed means with industry about how to give effect to that cap of 80 movements per hour. With the greatest respect to the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), who was playing catch&hyphen;up politics with his private member's bill, I suspect that it might actually have been a bit of a preselection ploy&mdash;that is what we reckon on this side of the House&mdash;that he needed to be seen to be doing something.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8871">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But all his bill did was meet half of our election commitment. What he did not do was have the mechanism for the implementation. So he had a bit of paper, which was our election policy, and he said, `Right. I've got that through. I'll put it on the table and I'll walk away.' Where was the mechanism? Nowhere at all. He avoided the hard issue: the mechanism for the implementation. It was catch&hyphen;up politics. He took our election campaign policy but did not have the means or the wherewithal to put in place the mechanism for the implementation. At the end of the day, that meant that it was a first come first serve basis, which was going to be absolutely inappropriate and disastrous for the Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point to remember about our long&hyphen;term operating plan for Sydney is that it meets our commitment to maximise flights over water and non&hyphen;residential land and to more equitably share the noise generated by the airport. It is a fair policy that has been implemented by this government. Indeed, the assertion that there would be no flights over Bennelong was just a bit more cheapjack politics from those on the other side. The member for Grayndler knows that it is not true. It was absolutely untrue, a bit of a gee&hyphen;up to keep the pot boiling but with no basis at all. Indeed, this plan is about sharing aircraft noise and about getting away from the funnelling across specific residential areas that was done by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The targets for the plan should be known by those opposite. They made no reference to it. They wanted to avoid the issue. They did not want to make the acknowledgments. The targets for the plan are 55 per cent of movements to the south&mdash;basically Botany Bay&mdash;17 per cent to the north, 15 per cent to the west and 13 per cent to the east. It is sharing the noise. But what did the Labor Party have? They had over 50 per cent of movements over suburbs north of the airport. As the member for Grayndler knows acutely, the residents north of the airport never got a break under the Labor Party. We have already cut it to 33 per cent and, as he well knows, our target is to cut it to 17 per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The utter hypocrisy of the Labor Party, both before this debate and during it, is absolutely mind blowing. They went to the last election, as the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) and the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) know, with not one commitment to a cap.</PARA>

But she was quite happy to be part of a Labor government which promised to fast track an international 24-hour airport on the same site&mdash;the one and the same. It is amazing what happens when you go from here on the government benches to there on the opposition benches. We had the same thing from the member for Chifley (Mr Price)&mdash;Hopalong Cassidy. He hopped from the government across to the opposition and totally changed every single thing he had said about Badgerys Creek in the space of about 35 seconds.

I am not going to talk any more about that because I want to turn to the New South Wales Labor Party, the New South Wales ALP government&mdash;the great hypocrites in the debate about Badgerys Creek.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I will quote the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith too&mdash;this is fairly interesting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major beneficiaries of these developments are the people of western Sydney. There will be a significant direct and indirect employment opportunity available in western Sydney and Macarthur region flowing out of these works. The establishment of a major airport is also likely to attract other industries to the region, again with consequent employment opportunities for western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But who has been driving the anti&hyphen;Badgerys Creek process? Minister Knowles and a few of the ones that are sort of weaseling around over on the other side there, giving Knowles a bit of a push along: `Go on, mate. Go on, you do it. We can't say much about it because we're fully compromised on this, but you go and do it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within minutes of the Holsworthy decision being made, the New South Wales planning minister, Craig Knowles, said that the New South Wales state ALP government would at all costs be opposing Badgerys Creek. Who is going to pay for that? Not Backflip Bob. You know who is going to pay for it as well as I do. The New South Wales taxpayers are going to pay for this. They are going to pay dearly for it if you continue to oppose it. Of course, all this happened when Backflip Bob was overseas. Knowles came out and said, `We're going to put our full resources into opposing Badgerys Creek.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Premier Carr has got to make it quite clear, once and for all, whether he does or does not support Badgerys Creek. Roger, you know that as well as I do. He either puts Knowles down or he supports him. If he is going to support him, he had better come clean and tell the people of New South Wales. And he ought to tell you guys as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish today to associate myself with the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in this debate and to support the second reading amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). I will be more general and briefer in my remarks than usual, given the lengthy list of speakers on our side and our undertaking to the government and publicly to ensure that the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  goes from the House to the Senate by the end of October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I hope to participate in the consideration in detail stage of the debate, which will occur after the Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund reports on 27 October, by which time this House and the members of it will have had the chance to contemplate the submissions made to that committee, the evidence received and the committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the heart of our attitude to the bill before the House today is the desire to make native title processes more certain, to make the act 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8876"> more workable, to make sure that the act is fair, and to make sure that the act is predictable. They are the hallmarks that the Leader of the Opposition has set down for our consideration of this bill. We want to see a native title process which is more certain, fair and workable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own case, I take part in this debate as a member of the parliament when the Native Title Act 1993 was passed by this House; as a Western Australian whose state, in practical terms, is the state most affected by the provisions of the Native Title Act; and as the shadow minister for resources and energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The starting point for this debate is the Mabo No. 2 decision of the High Court of June 1992. The essential element of that decision by the High Court was that native title was recognised as a common law property right&mdash;a legal property right. That raised fundamental property and constitutional questions for the parliament to respond to. The subsequent High Court decision in the Wik case, which made the point that native title is not extinguished by pastoral leases, has seen this set of amendments come to the House. The key starting point is native title being recognised by the High Court as a fundamental property right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the difficulties that the then government and this parliament faced in 1993 was that this recognition came a couple of hundred years too late. In comparable jurisdictions such as the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand, the notion of a native title property right had been recognised much earlier. What this parliament and the previous government had to do was to grapple with the insertion of a legal property right into our property law framework 200 years after the event, and try to grapple with that in a much more compressed timetable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court also made the point in the Mabo case that, whilst it was open for native title to be extinguished by valid government activity with an intention to so extinguish, there was no right of compensation at common law. However, any extinguishment had to be consistent with the Racial Discrimi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nation Act. That was a view that the High Court took by a majority of six to one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to make the point that it was only by a four to three majority that the High Court in Mabo No. 2 said that compensation was not payable for any extinguishment of native title from inception. In other words, the High Court was one vote away from saying that native title, however so extinguished from the first moment of European settlement in this place, was compensatable. That is an important point which I will come to subsequently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what the parliament had to do then and what the parliament has to do now is to work through a fundamental property right. There is one of two ways that the parliament or a government can go: either you can say, `Let us leave it to the courts,' or you can say, `Let us try to find some statutory process to manage this fundamental property right.' That was the attitude that the previous government took and that saw the enactment of the Native Title Act of 1993 through this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this parliament wants to legislate, this parliament can legislate only if it finds a valid head of power. In this area, given that until the decision of the High Court in Mabo No. 2 property rights had effectively been managed by state and territory jurisdictions, you need to find a Commonwealth head of power. There are only two Commonwealth heads of power that this parliament can resort to in this matter: the external affairs power and the race power as a consequence of the referendum change in 1967.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what are the limitations that the parliament then and the parliament now finds upon itself? It is dealing with a fundamental property right. It has got limited Commonwealth power and, therefore, constitutional limitations and implications. And, in a practical sense, it has to find a statutory regime which is attractive enough to the parties concerned to use it, because it remains open to any party to go to the courts to pursue a common law claim for native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in addition to grappling with constitutional problems and in addition to grappling with a fundamental property right, you have to make the process attractive enough so that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8877"> people want to use it. It is also desirable to ensure that whatever process you establish encourages agreement rather than litigation. So they are some of the legal hurdles and some of the practical hurdles which this parliament now finds before it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Act of 1993 has seen some good outcomes and some bad outcomes. I think the best outcome is the Yandicoogina agreement entered into between Hamersley Iron, a company operating in the north-west of Western Australia, and three local Aboriginal tribal groups who formed a corporation, the Gumala Aboriginal Corporation, to represent them. The end result of the agreement between Hamersley Iron and the Aboriginal communities represented by that corporation sees a $705 million iron ore development go ahead, a maximum $60 million royalty stream to that Aboriginal community and, most importantly, commitments to ensure that the investment which goes to that Aboriginal community is an investment by way of jobs, by way of training, by way of community infrastructure and by way of improvements in education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is the best example of a regional agreement that we have. On the other hand, you have the worst aspect of the Native Title Act of 1993, which has seen only one out of 600 claims proceed through the tribunal. In reference to a visit that I and the Leader of the Opposition made recently to Kalgoorlie, the Leader of the Opposition made the point in his speech that Kalgoorlie is perhaps the worst example where we see multiple claims, overlapping claims and an uncertain process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So on the one hand we see a good utilisation of regional agreements and on the other hand we see the need to massively improve processes. How do we fix this process? How do we on the one hand continue to encourage regional agreements with those organisations that have the resources to do it and on the other hand fix the processes? This gets to the heart or the fundamentals of the bill that the government has placed before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great difficulty for this House and for the parliament is that the government's bill does not make it better; the government's bill makes it worse. The government's bill has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> serious constitutional question marks attached to it, will raise serious questions of just compensation and will encourage common law claims and the pursuit of claims before federal courts, state supreme courts and the High Court rather than discourage them. So the solution which the government has put before the parliament will make it worse rather than make it better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I alluded earlier to the compensation point and I said that the High Court in Mabo No. 2 was one vote away from saying that native title, however so extinguished, from inception was compensatable. If you have a look at what the High Court has recently said on compensation for property law entitlements, and a case that it has currently before it, it is clear that the High Court is in a mood to view very seriously the extinguishment of property law entitlements and to apply a very rigorous test so far as compensation is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent example we have seen coming out of the High Court was the compensation decision in respect of Coronation Hill. The High Court currently has before it a case dealing with Western Mining Corporation and the expropriation by the Commonwealth of petroleum exploration permits in the Timor Gap, expropriated by the Commonwealth to help enable the Australia-Indonesia zone of cooperation to go ahead in the Timor Sea. It will be interesting to see how that case is handled by the High Court, but there is now the question that the High Court these days is treating very seriously the notion of just compensation for the expropriation of property law entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The view which has been expressed by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and is reflected by the amendment which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has placed before the House outlines our view of the very serious constitutional and legal difficulties attached to this bill. Our view has been sustained in recent days by the public release of a legal opinion prepared by the Australian Law Reform Commission. As the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) last night described it on the ABC, the Australian Law Reform Commission is an `independent, impartial and objective body'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8878">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has the Australian Law Reform Commission had to say about the government's native title bill? It is not as if the government has been rushing off its feet to make this public, but on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on Monday there is a reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission's opinion on the government's native title bill. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reports as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The submission, obtained by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS> , said the Wik plan to effectively extinguish native title on pastoral leases is unconstitutional and "will yield more, not less, litigation and compound uncertainty and lack of confidence in Australian real property law".</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most damaging for the government, it says the compensation payable would cripple taxpayers and hinder rather than promote mining development.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to quote the opinion of the Law Reform Commission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The compensation implications of the bill are potentially so substantial that the Government ought to think very carefully before making such a large&hyphen;scale commitment of taxpayers' funds . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You do not need to go much further than paragraphs 1.7 and 4.10 of the Australian Law Reform Commission's comments on the Native Title Amendment Bill. At paragraph 1.7 the commission says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the mechanism by which legal certainty for non&hyphen;exclusive leaseholders is to be achieved will almost certainly fail on the grounds that it will yield more, not less, litigation and compound uncertainty and lack of confidence in Australian real property law.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At paragraph 4.10 the commission, in respect of the compensation point, goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission considers that the compensation implications of the Bill are potentially so substantial that the Government ought to think very carefully before making such a large scale commitment of taxpayers funds to the extinguishment of the property and cultural rights of indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The view reflected by the opposition's amendment is buttressed and supported by the Australian Law Reform Commission's opinion and view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other day, in the course of debate, the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) referred to an article that I had written for the Australian Gas Association's quarterly journal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where I made the point&mdash;quite openly&mdash;that on our side we regarded the Native Title Act 1993 as not producing a perfect result. The member for Cowan referred to this as if this were somehow a stinging point. I would like to draw his and the House's attention to a speech I gave to the Australian Petroleum Producers and Exploration Association in April of this year, shortly after I became shadow minister for resources, where under the heading of `Native Title' I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition will work in the national interest to seek an acceptable outcome to native title. Kim Beazley has made that clear both publicly and privately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Native Title Act of 1993 is not perfect. However, when you are breaking new legislative ground, as we did with native title, that will almost always be the case. As well, Federal Court and subsequent Tribunal decisions since have not helped the process or the procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our proposed 1995 amendments reflected our own recognition that the Act was not perfect and that the procedures and processes needed to be improved and made more workable. These were not dealt with before the dissolution of Parliament and the election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the reasons the Act is not perfect is that the Senate amendments to the original Bill are imperfect. As Kim Beazley has said, we don't have a dog in the manger attitude to this issue, unlike the then Coalition Opposition, who in 1993 walked away in the Senate, leaving the Bill to the Greens (WA) and Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a clear national interest in an amendment Bill in the main being supported by both major political parties. That was the case in 1993, and it is the case now.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, however, you go down the extinguishment path, you will end up in the High Court forever, tying up development forever.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is in my view a better way through&mdash;we need a better, more workable process which will provide certainty and validity and which is fair to all the stakeholders.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those comments are reflected in the contributions made by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. On our side we are committed to making sure the procedures under this act are clear, efficient and timely, but they will not be achieved in the form of the bill that the government has presented to the House.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8879">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude my remarks by quoting briefly from the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition on 21 September when he opened the debate for the opposition. He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wik case is a common law claim. It has been in the courts since June 1993. It is still there, with matters of substance related to it yet to be determined. That is four years down the track. Think of the 600 or so claims currently registered with the tribunal. The collapse, in the face of High Court challenge, of a badly amended act . . . by an unthinking government, would see all those cases, and more, clogging up our courts indefinitely. The pastoral industry might survive such a scenario but not the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill that the government has put before the House will not make matters better but make matters worse. It is a recipe for uncertainty, it is a recipe for multiple claims before the High Court and it is a recipe for massively clogging up the system altogether. The government should pay heed to the second reading amendment which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has placed before the House and should ensure that these matters are uppermost in its mind when it comes to, I hope, a proper, full, objective and fair consideration of these matters in the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does give me a great deal of pleasure to rise this afternoon to discuss this very important piece of reforming legislation. The amendments will fix the diabolical mess left by the Labor Party in relation to the state of the land tenure system in this country. We all know that in 1992 the High Court ruled in the landmark Mabo case that indigenous Australians' native title to land has always existed under common law. The High Court declared that native title held by indigenous people may survive, regardless of new laws enacted by a colonising government. Of course, the Mabo case specifically related to the Murray Islands. However, the court noted that common law is the same across Australia and, therefore, native title may still exist on the mainland as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This judgment by the High Court threw all existing land tenure systems in Australia into total disarray. Confusion reigned as to the status of leases held by pastoralists, miners and indigenous people, and there was concern about the ruling's impact on future development and access. The High Court's Mabo ruling dictated that the parliament issue an urgent and comprehensive legislative response in order to restore certainty. The Labor government acted when it introduced the Native Title Act in 1993, the most ill-conceived piece of legislation I think Australia has ever seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 the coalition consistently declared the legislation unworkable and incomplete. I stand here today speaking on these amendments as proof that the opinion has sadly been proved correct. Four years and 600 native title claims later there has been only one determination of native title on mainland Australia. Meanwhile, thousands of honest hardworking Australians have had their lives turned upside down by claims over their family farms and property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Companies wanting to develop land which would benefit this country's economy have had projects halted indefinitely by native title claims. Major developments in the Northern Territory worth hundreds of millions of dollars have had native title claims slapped on them and so cannot proceed. The Native Title Act was in urgent need of reform even before 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8880"> the  coalition came to government. Once elected, the Prime Minister made it one of his priorities to fix this mess and appointed his parliamentary secretary, Senator Nick Minchin, to undertake a review of the act with a view to restoring certainty for both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government started work on the amendments to the act immediately and waited with interest to see how the result of the Wik decision would affect the government's position. In December last year the High Court complicated matters further with the Wik ruling, which determined that pastoral leases do not necessarily extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is determined to react responsibly to the challenges this ruling presents. The bill before the House today will reduce the uncertainties regarding land tenure, simplify the whole process in determining the existence of native title, improve the workability of the act, and increase the community's understanding of native title issues and processes. This bill is a result of the Prime Minister's and Senator Minchin's extensive consultation process. They have worked tirelessly to ensure that all interested parties have been consulted on the amendments proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point I would like to acknowledge the role the Northern Territory government played in these negotiations. I commend their efforts to ensure the situation in the territory was always prominent in the minds of those preparing this legislation. Out of these consultations came the government's 10&hyphen;point plan which this legislation incorporates. Before commenting on the implications of this legislation for my constituents, I would like to remind honourable members of the exemplary record the Northern Territory has in the field of land rights for Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I got a bit sick of hearing from those Labor members opposite that the territory government is racist, and I think this is an opportune time to inform members of the real situation in the territory. Forty&hyphen;eight per cent of the territory is covered by the title granted under the Aboriginal land rights act. That is almost 700,000 square kilometres of the Northern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Territory. An Aboriginal benefits trust account allows for the progressive purchase of land throughout the territory, up to $20 million per year. There is $1.4 billion in the Indigenous Land Fund, which should be sufficient to address the land needs of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory already has community living areas legislation which has resulted in living areas for Aboriginals being excised from pastoral properties. The territory has a comprehensive and effective sacred sites legislation, the single most important issue for traditional Aborigines. Aborigines have a statutory access regime in place for access to pastoral lands for traditional activities like hunting and fishing. There is also a separate regime in place to allow access to sacred sites. The territory provides for the co&hyphen;management of parks. There are now parks under joint control that would meet an international benchmark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to these points, I would also like to add that, since the introduction of the Aboriginal land rights legislation, Aboriginal groups in the Northern Territory have been paid some $350 million in royalties. The evidence shows that the territory already has in place the mechanisms for recognition of indigenous people's traditional links with the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite ATSIC spending $90 million of Commonwealth money on native title claims, the act has not delivered any tangible benefits to Aboriginal Australians. In fact, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator John Herron, has informed me that the state of Aboriginal affairs under Labor did not result in any gains in the area of Aboriginal health. There may have been gains in the area of land claims, but I have been informed by the minister that 30 per cent of Aboriginal children in Alice Springs still suffer from malnutrition. Meanwhile, someone in ATSIC decides that $90 million is better spent on land claims. This is why it is so important that the coalition government has a policy of quarantining ATSIC funds for health, housing and education programs, as it is clearly not always their priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the 48 per cent of the territory already granted to Aboriginal groups, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8881"> there are now extensive native title claims over our towns, beaches, public parks and the coastline. How can we forget the chaos that exists over the status of our pastoral leases? The previous Labor government developed the Native Title Act on the assumption that pastoral leases extinguished native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Prime Minister stated that the government's view was `under the common law, past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title. There is therefore no obstacle or hindrance to the renewal of pastoral leases in the future.' The High Court's Wik ruling proved him wrong. The Labor government's native title legislation was drafted on the assertion that less than 36 per cent of Australia's vacant crown land could be claimed. The Wik decision means that 78.6 per cent of Australia can now be claimed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">State and territory governments will be able to legislate to allow the continuation and the protection of all existing activities defined as primary production under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These activities can be carried out without interference of native title holders. The coalition has worked very hard to fix the mess left by the Labor Party and this legislation is good for the territory. It addresses the concerns that territorians have about land tenure and delivers appropriate returns to Aborigines. The package guarantees the validity of any acts or grants issued on vacant crown land between the passage of the 1993 Native Title Act and the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The territory government, acting in good faith, issued some exploration licences on the previously accepted premise that a pastoral lease extinguished native title, and these remain valid. State and territory governments will be able to confirm that native title is extinguished by `exclusive' tenures like freehold, commercial and public works in existence on or before 1 January 1994. It is this provision that will ensure that most parts of the current claims over Darwin and Alice Springs will fail. Agricultural leases are also covered to the extent that, where it is reasonable to suggest through the purpose of the grant or the nature of the land use, exclusive possession is assumed. Any current or former 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pastoral lease conferring exclusive possession would also be included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Land grants from the Northern Territory government to bodies such as town councils would extinguish native title, meaning our parks and reserves could not be claimed. This legislation ensures that the provision of government services like pipelines, roads, railways and municipal services may not be impeded by native title claims. There will be a continuation of statutory access rights for native title claimants. This does not conflict with the current access rights enjoyed by Aborigines as a result of territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most controversial aspects of Labor's legislation was the right to negotiate provisions in respect of mining and certain compulsory acquisitions. The right to negotiate has delayed many important commercial and mining developments Australia-wide. There have been no gains for Aboriginal people at the grassroots level through the right to negotiate. It often seems to be the case that Aboriginal land councils are more interested in achieving the right to negotiate for extraordinary amounts of financial compensation than in securing native title to land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A higher registration test will be required for claimants seeking the right to negotiate on future mining activity. Proof of attachment to a particular piece of land will have to be provided and claimants will not be able to impede mining exploration as there will be no negotiations on exploration licences. There will only be one right to negotiate per project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">States and territories will be able to introduce their own mining regimes for dealing with land under their jurisdiction as long as the access rights of native title holders are not compromised. There will be no right to negotiate over vacant crown land outside towns and cities required for government type infrastructure. This is good news for high population growth areas like the territory as it means the government will have the ability to plan for schools, health clinics and powerlines with certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ability of the territory government to regulate and manage airspace plus surface, subsurface and offshore waters would be put beyond doubt. The native title claim in Alice 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8882"> Springs claims subterranean waters in and around the area. This legislation would make that part of the claim invalid. It would also ensure that amateur fishermen continue to have the right to enter and fish in territory waters unimpeded. The legislation would also facilitate negotiations of voluntary but binding agreements as an alternative to proceeding with the requirements under the native title legislation if the parties would prefer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the coalition has introduced a bill that fixes the mess left by the Labor Party. It is my optimistic hope that the Labor Party will support these amendments in order to restore certainty for all Australians, indigenous and non-indigenous. I am concerned, however, that the ALP has indicated that it does not support all of the amendments proposed, supporting instead regional agreements similar to those promoted by the Northern Land Council and Central Land Council. This idea is completely unworkable in terms of administration and financial arrangements. It is the kind of idea that the former member for the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon, often promoted as the self&hyphen;interested bureaucrat that he was and still is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He used to stand up in this place and boast about his previous life before politics when he was a bureaucrat with the Central Land Council. He even said, and I quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on 23 November 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fundamentally, we had the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to do this right. What gets up the nose of the opposition is the fact that the Prime Minister spent the time to get it right when the opposition has no hope of getting it right.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How wrong he was. No wonder the people of the territory got rid of him. He also used to talk of ATSIC's prestige and the gains it had made in securing social justice for Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note when I read his old speeches in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that he never talked about social justice for non-Aboriginals. He never talked about achieving a fair and balanced outcome for all concerned in relation to native title. He never talked about the waste of $90 million on land claims while Aboriginal people still suffer terrible health problems. The former member had no interest in representing terri 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tory pastoralists, businesses or families affected by native title claims. That is why in March last year territorians threw him out of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the former member, Mr Snowdon, has been looked after by the Aboriginal industry in the Northern Territory since his departure from this place in March last year. He popped up last week as a representative of the national indigenous working group at a committee meeting here in Canberra to discuss these native title amendments. He was naturally quite hostile towards any suggestion of reforming the Native Title Act as his mates in the land councils thrive on this environment of litigation and uncertainty for both indigenous and non-indigenous members of the Northern Territory community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have worked hard as the new member for the Northern Territory to achieve some equity in the amendments to the Native Title Act for all territorians. As secretary of the government members committee on Aboriginal affairs, and as a member of the joint committee on native title, I hope to represent the views of both indigenous and non-indigenous territorians on the enormous problems we face with the current native title legislation. These amendments outlined in the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  restore the balance. They deliver a fair result to both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one moves around the country on the committees that one serves on and listens to the various groups talk about the proposed 10-point plan and the latest amendments that have now been circulated by the government, one can only wonder about some of the information that is coming back. Some people support the amendments the government has proposed, but those organisations that have a vested interest are mostly the ones that have no intention of supporting the government's amendments, and they have said so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened with a great deal of interest to those communities, but the important thing we all have to remember is that, until such time as this particular problem is sorted out, it is really not going to have any benefit to any members of the community&mdash;whether they be indigenous or non-indigenous Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8883"> ians. We now have to start focusing on the real needs of our indigenous communities&mdash;that is, the provision of health, education and housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said on many occasions in this parliament that there are communities in Central Australia&mdash;for whom the Labor Party had responsibility for over 13 years&mdash;that do not have water or even electricity. They do not have electricity to run a fridge to keep their food from being spoilt so their children can have a decent diet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can sit opposite and say, `We don't like what the government is doing because it does not accord with our plans.' You had a go at doing it in 1993, you did not do it properly and now you are trying to stop the coalition government from putting its amendments&mdash;amendments decided on after six months of consultation with many organisations throughout Australia, both non-indigenous and indigenous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aboriginal communities have a right to get some kind of direction, and that is the direction this coalition government is going to provide. With the amendments to the Native Title Act, there will be certainty for them and for other people as well. Let me just say once more that there are communities in Central Australia that do not have water and do not have electricity. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) made an interesting point in his contribution. He suggested that, in his travels, he had had a diversity of views put to him regarding the government's amendments. He suggested that those who did not have, as he put it, a vested interest supported the government's position. The reality is, I fear, rather different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality we are starting to see is that this government has engaged in a pattern of suppression&mdash;behaviour intended to prevent critical comment by bodies which have a public responsibility to advise the government and the parliament. These bodies have been prevented from putting their scepticism about this legislation before the community. It now appears that there is a pattern, with key Howard government ministers seeking to stop 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> critical independent comment from their key advisory bodies becoming known to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has become known, because of the controversy of recent days, that there was a successful attempt by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to nobble the Law Reform Commission&mdash;to prevent the Law Reform Commission, which for decades has played a role of providing advice to government committees, from providing its independent advice to the parliamentary committee established to review the proposed legislation we are presently discussing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know now that that intervention by the Attorney-General was preceded by certain conduct of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). We know that the Prime Minister raised with the Attorney-General his concern about the impact the Law Reform Commission's submission to an internal working group of the government had had. The Law Reform Commission's conclusions essentially said that key elements of the government's proposal would not work, would not provide certainty and would cost the community enormously through compensation payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full detail of how this matter has worked its way out is yet to be revealed. But certainly, at the very least, there would appear to be questions about whether or not the Attorney-General's specific instruction to the Law Reform Commission to withdraw its submission was at the direction of the Prime Minister, or at the direction of others acting specifically on his behalf or with his authority, to prevent the public from becoming aware of those damning criticisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this was an isolated instance, one might merely say that it was an appallingly poor set of judgments by both concerned. But it was not isolated. Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment, intervened in May to prevent Professor Roger Kitching from issuing on behalf of the Biological Diversity Advisory Council a press release which called on the federal government to address the environmental consequences of its 10-point response to Wik as a matter of urgency.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concede you are correct. The importance about this matter is that the legislation currently before this parliament is framed around a set of proposals which the government's key environmental advisory body, established by the minister and said by the minister to be the government's prime source of advice on biological diversity matters, has criticised as posing a threat of great significance to general loss of biodiversity. This was not a frivolous act by the Biological Diversity Advisory Council. The council prepared a press release because of its concern. I have a copy of that press release which was suppressed by the minister. In that press release, the chairman proposed to say this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has been asked to address the environmental consequences of its 10 point response to Wik and native title in general as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Biological Diversity Advisory Council, established to give advice to the Minister on the conservation of Australia's biological diversity are concerned that increased tenure to pastoralists will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lead to diminished government control on the 42 per cent of Australia under pastoral lease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chairman of BDAC, Professor Roger Kitching, said it was not the committee's role to debate the social justice elements of native title and its extinguishment but rather it is to focus on the consequences for biodiversity conservation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Following a two&hyphen;day meeting, Professor Kitching said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The tenure and control over pastoral leases will be one of the biggest decisions government has made in recent history about the future of Australia's environment . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Loss of biodiversity is recognised as Australia's number one environmental issue. The principal loss of biodiversity is occurring through broadscale clearing and poor land management practices in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The committee was of the view that loss of biodiversity is advancing at an increasing rate despite an increasing level of awareness throughout the community and some outstanding examples of biodiversity conservation within some communities, landcare groups and local government areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"For example the Qld Government has issued permits to clear 500,000 ha of native vegetation in Qld in the last twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Our concern is that diminished control over publicly owned land leased for grazing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">a consequence of this Wik legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will lead to increased activity in clearing, pasture improvement and general loss of biodiversity in the interests of increasing production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"At a time when the Natural Heritage Trust is making vegetation management and reversing the loss of native vegetation as its major objective it would be foolish to allow other government decisions to undermine these objectives.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The press release further stated that the BDAC had also met with the Chairman of the Australian Tourist Commission, Don Morris, who told the committee that the environment and culture are the major drawcards for overseas tourists visiting Australia. Mr Morris said that the value of that industry is $14.1 billion and that its resource base is, in the words of this release, `largely environment and cultural'. So that was the framework of an advice that was first tendered to the minister, but then proposed for public release by the chairman of the council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at who comprises the council. The council is not a bunch of eggheaded 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8885"> scientists. The council is the government's principal advisory group on biodiversity. It includes representatives of the scientific community, certainly, but it also includes representatives of local government, representatives from the pastoral industry and representatives from the mining industry&mdash;right across the board. I understand that the vote in relation to this matter was nearly unanimous. Only one member of the council did not assent to the proposal, not only to speak to the minister in the strongest terms about the biodiversity consequences, but also to assent to the release of the media statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We find now that we have a Minister for the Environment who suppresses advice to him and a public release of that advice from his own principal advisory body on biodiversity; we have an Attorney-General who suppresses advice from the Australian Law Reform Commission which was intended to be issued to the parliamentary committee looking at this legislation; yet we have the member for the Northern Territory popping his head up and absurdly saying that anyone who does not have a vested interest is in support of the government. The truth is that anyone who does not have a vested interest is the subject of a cover-up and a suppression by this government to prevent them putting on the record facts that the government does not wish to be known in relation to the proposals that it has put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The very issues that concern the Biological Diversity Advisory Council&mdash;the increased flexibility of land use that would emerge from a more relaxed view, if I might put it that way, in relation to uses to which formerly land applied only to grazing purposes could be put; that is, the extension of those purposes&mdash;are also drawn attention to by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its draft, which I also have. That draft is a document which this government intended to suppress. No doubt other speakers will draw attention to particular components of this document. But one component is particularly relevant to the comments that I wish to make on the environmental hazards that this bill also represents for the Australian community&mdash;the threat to biodiversity.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I just interpolate again so that the full impact of what Senator Hill did or did not do in relation to this matter is evident. Not only did he suppress the document but he did not pass on the council's concerns. When he appeared before the Senate estimates committee, it is transparent from his answers and from subsequent briefings that I have been provided with that the minister took no steps to pass on the concerns of his pre-eminent advisory body either to the task force which was considering the government's position, or to the Prime Minister, or to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) or to any other minister who was relevant to these proceedings. The Minister for the Environment noted it. What does that mean? He ignored it; he back pocketed it; he suppressed it; and he wished it would all go away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Law Reform Commission looked at the financial implications. They noted that the government has underestimated the cost to the Australian taxpayer of what is involved. There were three components mentioned: firstly, validation of past acts; secondly, confirmation of extinguishment on exclusive tenures; and, thirdly, upgrading of pastoral leases. They said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the upgrading of non&hyphen;exclusive agricultural and pastoral leases valid at 23 December 1996, permitting additional activities that fall within the definition of `primary production' will further reduce native title rights and lead to additional compensation liability. Likewise, the permanent extinguishment of inconsistent native title rights, rather than their suppression during the life of the lease may be influential in determining the quantum of compensation; lessees benefiting significantly at taxpayers expense&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and let us understand this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . lessees benefiting significantly at taxpayers expense instead of benefiting Consolidated Revenue by paying for their improved tenure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Now we are not talking about hundreds of little farmers here; we are not talking about the poor peasantry of Australia; we are talking about some of the biggest ever foreign&hyphen;owned land&hyphen;holdings and a few squattocracy families, including some who are represented on the front bench of this government. It is those people whose personal income, whose person 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8886"> al capital, will be increased as a result of this framing of the legislation, rather than it benefiting consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the commission concludes, it is seriously concerned:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the government has . . . underestimated the extent of compensation that will fall due as a consequence of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So there are two reasons for concern in relation to these issues that relate to the way in which what were previously grazing properties will be able to operate in the future should this legislation have effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, there is an environmental concern which hitherto has been suppressed, despite advice to this government by its key biodiversity advisory body. Secondly, there is the cost of it, and the transfer of wealth from taxpayers to a handful of rich pastoralists&mdash;not ordinary farmers. This has been suppressed as a consequence of the Attorney's suppression of the Australian Law Reform Commission. So there have been two acts of suppression, two acts of cover&hyphen;up&mdash;one on the environmental front, one on the Attorney's front&mdash;both designed to withhold from the Australian public the full implications of what this legislation intends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation does not give either certainty or fairness. It is legislation which has been brought forward without proper consultation with those who wish this government well in finding a solution, and that includes the opposition. There is no interest in finding, with those of us on the other side, an effective outcome that benefits all stakeholders in this particular complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It now increasingly seems to be the case that we have a government that will not open its ears to independent critical comment, including comment that goes to the constitutionality, the legal validity and the compensation in the bill, or to the on&hyphen;the&hyphen;ground effects, particularly the environmental consequences. More than that, not only does it wish its own ears to remain deaf but also it wishes the Australian community to have its ears remain deaf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have the wise monkey approach: we have hear no evil and see no evil, but we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have a government that is perfectly prepared to speak the evil, and to speak it repeatedly. It is prepared to malign those who raise any criticisms about the way it approaches this matter, and it is prepared to use language which is entirely inappropriate in terms of its hostility and the conflict it is prepared to stir up within the Australian community on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we get no certainty. We will find ourselves mired in more litigation. We find the cost to be underestimated. We find the government unprepared to recognise the impact this will have on the environment. We find an unwillingness on the part of the government to allow the work of those who have a critical and public role to play in Australia's community debate. Those who are tasked with these responsibilities by government&mdash;the Biological Diversity Advisory Council and the Law Reform Commission&mdash;are having their work suppressed, and the Australian community is prevented from hearing what they are entitled to have put before them so they may put their views on these important public matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the way in which we are seeking to facilitate the conclusion of this debate within a reasonable time, I recognise that I should cut short my remarks at this point. I will conclude by saying that this government is mired in cover&hyphen;ups of its own making which go not merely to its morality but also to public policy, and which now show the full impact of the malice that is behind it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not prepared to deal with matters that we in opposition have been talking about for a long time, which they have been criticising as coming from a partial commentator, whereas the fact is the impartial commentators who would otherwise have spoken have had their mouths silenced, quite improperly, by this government in a way which smacks of cover&hyphen;up. Indeed, particularly given the pecuniary interests of certain frontbench members of this government, it almost suggests the smell of corruption.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is doubtful if there has ever been a more controversial, divisive, costly and relatively non-productive decision in the history of the High 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8887"> Court in this country. I do not say that lightly. I represent a rural electorate. I represent more Aboriginal people than anybody else in south-east Australia. I have lived through this debate over the last few years at the coalface, so to speak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be some of us who do not like the High Court decision, but it is now the law of this country. Native title is now part of our common law, and we must live with that and work with it. That is what I believe this bill reflects quite accurately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1992 the Mabo decision was brought down by the High Court and they went on to say that native title may exist on mainland Australia. In December 1996, the High Court brought down what is known as the Wik decision whereby they said that native title may exist on pastoral leases, and that was a surprise to everybody. Even the present opposition did not factor that into their original native title bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title still has not been precisely defined by the High Court. I will use the words of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) when he made his second reading speech on this present bill. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite more than 3&half; years of the operation of the current act, for most of Australia we do not yet know where native title exists and, if it does, the identity of the native title holders or the nature of their rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course we have to have rules for all this work, and this present bill clarifies these rules and adds some additional provisions to deal with the new concept of coexisting native title on pastoral lease land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Up until now there has been an expectation out there&mdash;especially amongst Aboriginal people&mdash;that native title, including on pastoral leases, virtually equates to ownership. It does not, of course. But as a result of this the Aboriginal industry has hurled money at making claim after ridiculous claim. There has been no limit on the size of the claim and who may be registered. We have overlapping claims. One poor fellow with a mining lease in Western Australia has 26 overlapping claims on his mining lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told that if you add up the size of the land involved in all these claims it amounts 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to 143 per cent of the Australian land mass. Six hundred and twelve claims have been registered, over $100 million in legal fees has been wasted and we still do not have one square centimetre of native title land owned by Aboriginal people in Australia. In fact, there has only been one of the 612 claims resolved and that was for a few acres of land at Crescent Head on the North Coast of New South Wales and that was immediately sold back to the people who occupy the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The land councils are forever claiming that they want funds for quite proper activities that need to be done amongst the Aboriginal people. But they have gone totally berserk on paying lawyers to chase frivolous native title claims. The Cape York Land Council is spending in excess of $12 million doing that now. The Kimberley Land Council has spent in excess of $12 million. Even in New South Wales, up to 30 June this year, the New South Wales Land Council has spent $4,433,475, including $2 million last year&mdash;a total waste of money in the main.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The red soil country around Brewarrina, Bourke and Wanaaring in my electorate where claims have been put in is selling for an average of $8 an acre. It means that, if they had put that money into buying the land, they could own in excess of 550,000 acres now and own it outright. Even if native title were granted&mdash;and it will not be on the claims that have been put in so far&mdash;all they can do is go onto the land and hold a corroboree, which nobody is interested in doing in New South Wales, throw a line in the Darling River to fish or spear a goanna or something like that. Whereas if the money had been spent to purchase the land like every other Australian, they could own the land outright. Money is being wasted. It has caused incredible anguish, particularly amongst the landowners throughout my electorate, and it has set reconciliation back years. It is a wicked waste of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a myth afoot in this country that Aboriginal people own little or no land. The 1996 census showed that there are 353,000 Aborigines in Australia&mdash;that is, 2 per cent of the population&mdash;and they owned 15.3 per cent of the land mass or 117 million hectares of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8888"> land in Australia. That is greater in size than the total land mass of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory or&mdash;if we can take an overseas example&mdash;greater than the land mass of Northern Ireland, Scotland, England, Wales, France and Germany, both East and West, put together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of this there is a certain amount of private land ownership. They own 341 properties and the last 200 that were purchased had an average value of $454,000 for the land alone. For example, that alone is more than double the land value of the property that I own. So we are not talking about insubstantial properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to all this, the New South Wales government puts aside 7&half; per cent of land tax collected to purchase properties. On those properties they also own all mineral rights, except for gold and silver, as well as oil and coal, and they get royalties from any mining conducted on those properties. There is also the indigenous land fund which is worth $1,289 million in 1994-95 dollar terms. The money put aside from that alone would purchase 100 farms for Aboriginal people every year forever&mdash;farms worth twice the value of my own property, for example. There have been other sources of funding. For example, the Northern Territory mining royalties to Aboriginal people now amount to more than $350 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this legislation before the parliament today, 78.6 per cent of the Australian land mass is available for claim under native title legislation. One wonders if we have our priorities right. I saw a recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> article on death rates in the Northern Territory. The most common cause of death amongst Aboriginal females was homicide. The most common cause of death amongst Aboriginal males was car accidents, closely followed by homicide, and the premature deaths of Aboriginal infants were four times the Australian average. It is an absolute disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the sorts of things that we should be concentrating on and debating in this country today. But I see that ATSIC just recently funded an extra $80,000 to put a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> challenge up against the Hindmarsh Island Bridge legislation, which everybody knows has absolutely no chance whatsoever of succeeding. It is doomed to fail, and $80,000 is totally wasted when they could be spending money in these proper areas that desperately need funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My point on this bill is that the High Court decision was supposed to deliver something beneficial to Aboriginal people. So far it has delivered virtually nothing&mdash;certainly nothing on mainland Australia. In fact, it has wasted many millions of dollars. It has become an instrument of divisiveness. If you look at it objectively, it has become a curse to Aboriginal people in diverting these large sums of money to chasing ephemeral rainbows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about pastoral leases, particularly those in New South Wales. The High Court said in the Wik decision that unless you have exclusive possession on leasehold land then native title may exist on leasehold land. This has caused much angst in New South Wales, but there has been a total misunderstanding of what the High Court said by both sides of the argument&mdash;Aboriginal on one side and pastoralists on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales Farmers Association has attacked the coalition quite unfairly, I think, in calling us `spineless, gutless, shallow' and just about every other colourful adjective that you can think of. I believe that they have whipped some people into an unnecessary frenzy on this. They have been asking for the grazing leases in the Western Division of New South Wales to be included in the schedule. They have done that almost to the exclusion of all other debate about the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of points I would make. The schedule never existed until the coalition invented it, and it is attached to this bill. Of course, if the grazing leases are listed in the schedule, there is the belief that this makes them exempt from native title claims. That is true only if all sides of the debate accept that they should be in the schedule for proper reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of legal advice around that there is some doubt as to whether these leases should be in the schedule. The New South 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8889"> Wales government's legal advice on two occasions said that they should not be scheduled. The Commonwealth took its own legal advice from Professor Butt, an expert in property law who works in the law department at the University of Sydney, and Grahame Tanna, who is the Principal Solicitor of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. They clearly said in their legal advice to us that Western Division grazing leases do not confer a right of exclusive possession and should not be included in the schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We asked the New South Wales Farmers Association to get some legal opinion on this. They have eventually come before us with four opinions, but those four opinions have some doubt about them. For example, the first opinion from David Bennett QC said in the conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances it is simply not possible to express with anything resembling certainty what view the High Court will take in relation to leases under the Western Lands Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on in his conclusion, when talking about granting exclusive possession, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the prospects of the High Court taking that view must be regarded as fairly evenly balanced.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The second opinion that they obtained was from Peter McEwen QC. Regarding the conclusions he had come to, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have done so on the basis of relatively limited information.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is not possible to prognosticate the view the Court&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the High Court&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would take when applying the principles enunciated in Wik to leases under the Western Lands Act with certainty or precision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The third opinion they put to us was from Dennis Rose QC who said that the leases should be scheduled but the arguments he seemed to use were the very arguments that were rejected by the High Court majority judges in the Wik decision. To some extent, that is also valid for Sek Hume's opinion, who was the fourth QC that the New South Wales Farmers Association put before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On balance, with all this conflicting legal advice, it would have been quite silly for us 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to schedule those leases, as the New South Wales Farmers Association wanted. I can understand and appreciate why they would want them scheduled. However, to do so would have destroyed the credibility of the schedule. It would have invited the other states who did not try this on to also have their leases which were excluded from the schedule included, and that would have collapsed the schedule. You may as well have taken out your Tippex, whited out whatever it was that was listed there and written in `Australia', if that was the attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, it would have given the Labor Party a classic case to vote against everything in the Senate. Even if it had passed the Senate&mdash;which it would not have&mdash;you would have immediately had a High Court challenge on the validity of the schedule. That would have delayed getting certainty into Western Division pastoral leases for many months, which is against the good interests of the people who occupy grazing leases in the Western Division who have been subject, in many cases, to a great degree of anguish and uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales Farmers Association have said that we are going to need 5,000 test cases in the Western Division to resolve this. I believe that that is a gross exaggeration and not true. They have also said that we will see paralysis of agricultural production. Again, I do not believe that is true at all. They have said that, if it can be shown that the grazing leases should be added to the schedule later on, it cannot be done. Again, I believe that is not true. If it is shown that grazing leases do extinguish native title, as I believe many of them would, then they can be added to the schedule later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have also used a Queensland comparison, saying that Queensland leases were included on the schedule where New South Wales comparable leases were not. Again, that is not quite correct. The small number of grazing homestead perpetual leases&mdash;small in area; I think it amounts to about 12.7 per cent of the state&mdash;are quite different from Western Division grazing leases. They have the right to apply to freehold the leases. They have the right to turn them into cultivation leases 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8890"> without permission. Their rents are calculated on the unimproved capital value instead of the livestock carrying capacity and so on. They are quite different leases from New South Wales grazing leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said all that about the schedule&mdash;because it has been such a contentious area&mdash;I do say that the bill, which is based on the 10&hyphen;point plan that we present to the parliament today, will fix everything that the New South Wales farmers want. There will be certainty returned to grazing because the primary production rights of the leaseholder predominate 100 per cent over the native title rights, even if they are shown to exist on some New South Wales grazing leases. No&hyphen;one can come on to your property and interfere in any way whatsoever with your legitimate activities. Even if you want to do other things in the future&mdash;if you can get permission, as you have to do now, to carry on cultivation activity, agricultural activity, tourist activity, or even running a helicopter flying school base if you wish&mdash;if that conflicts with the native title right, then we have made provision in this bill that the native title right can be bought out and compensation paid to the native title holders. The cost of the compensation will be picked up 75 per cent by the Commonwealth government and 25 per cent by the state government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the farmer, the pastoralist, the grazier will have no expense whatsoever. In fact, we will pick up 100 per cent of the cost of legal aid, if it is needed at any stage, for test cases to be run. I believe you would probably want only one or two and you could just about solve the problem in the Western Division in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe that if we can get this bill through virtually unamended and have it all finished by Christmas then this time next year all the difficulty and sorrow and everything else that has been associated with the present native title bill will have evaporated, because most of the claims in the Western Division, if not all of them as I have seen them, just cannot stand up. They will fail the registration test. Under our registration test you have got to have a proper identification of the area and proper maps. You have got to have a proper 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> identification of the native title claim group under section 190 and you have got to have a proper description of the native title you are claiming for. It must be presented on a factual basis and you must have a prima facie case. Mineral rights are not included. Also, the physical connection with the land must be established. I will just read this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Registrar must be satisfied that at least one member of the native title claim group currently has or previously had a traditional physical connection with the area covered by the application.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This connection must amount to more than a transitory access or intermittent non&hyphen;native title access. In other words, your grandfather cannot just have held a picnic there in 1920, or your relatives cannot have come in on a motorbike from South Australia, or you cannot just claim you have had a spiritual connection with the land. You must be able to establish a physical connection. I would have liked to have seen that a bit tighter, but I believe it is far superior to what exists in the present act and it will largely solve the problem. Overall, I do believe this legislation reflects accurately what the High Court wanted and it respects both sides of the debate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with some sorrow that I rise to speak in this debate. I say that because I believe that the thrust of this bill is an endeavour to turn the clock back. I think it was with some pride that, in the last couple of years, Australia as a nation has sought to make a statement that it really wanted to deliver and develop the concept of one nation&mdash;a nation committed to doing something for the betterment of all Australians irrespective of their background.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, I say that I very much support the thrust of the second reading amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Evans. The problem for the House today is that the thrust of this bill is really an endeavour by the Howard government to force a debate about Wik and native title, and it is a guise to launch a major attack on some of the most needy and disadvantaged people in our nation. That really is what the thrust of the bill is about&mdash;turning the clock 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8891"> back and walking away from the needs of the most disadvantaged of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many years Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders were the people who were out of sight and out of mind. They very much sought the help of many members of the Howard government. But the Howard government considered them out of sight and out of mind, and had the capacity to turn their backs on the needs of the most disadvantaged people in the nation while they feathered their own nests in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My position is that I think the Australian community at large is of the view that it is no longer possible to argue that they are the forgotten Australians. The tide has turned. It is not just the alarming issues of poor health, appalling living standards, shocking education levels and the lack of employment that have kept indigenous Australians in the public consciousness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The broader Australian community has come to look with pride on the expressions of a unique and vibrant culture which has correctly attracted international attention through artists and musicians and people such as Yothu Yindi and Christine Anu. Wherever we go as a nation now we stand with some pride when we consider the achievements of our indigenous people. But the problem with this government is that it likes to embrace the Olympic champions, the international artists and the international musicians, but when it comes to the nitty gritty of really trying to do something about the most disadvantaged in the community, it wants to drive a wedge between mainstream Australia and those in the most disadvantaged places in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take, for example, Yothu Yindi in particular. Through their songs they have popularised the ambitions and struggles of indigenous Australians for land rights as an expression of their culture. Long years of deprivation, dispossession, abuse and neglect have left enduring scars, and so they ought to. None of us can be proud of those scars, but it comes back to an endeavour and a commitment to actually do something to ensure that we overcome those scars in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But,<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">despite those scars, a vibrant culture is attracting the attention and support of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wider Australian community and the world. The Howard government has got to understand that, with respect to this debate, not only are Australian eyes on the House of Representatives today but also, more importantly, the international community is monitoring what happens with respect to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that the government's mishandling of the debate over Wik will reverberate around the world. No longer does Australia walk tall internationally. We have a Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) who has no international standing at all. The debate about Wik will further diminish Australia's standing internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer, for example, to the action in part of the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) which I suggest is part of a pattern of activity which reveals that this government see native title as an intrusion&mdash;an encumbrance&mdash;which they want to get rid of any way they can if at all possible. It is a problem that they want to sweep under the carpet because they are not committed to doing something to assist the indigenous people&mdash;some of the most disadvantaged people in this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really is a massive irony that this government is acting firmly and resolutely against property rights just because the property holders, on this occasion, are not white. That is what it is all about&mdash;property rights for the white community but not for those with black faces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal and National parties, after all, are the parties that trumpet their core ideological belief in property rights&mdash;yes, property rights for the whites but not the blacks. The Liberal and National parties, after all, are the parties which strut the Australian political stage declaiming their belief in law and order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Wik decision, the High Court, I would suggest, has decisively ruled that, yes, all Australians are entitled to property rights whether they have a black face or a white face. The High Court decision recognises the property rights&mdash;and correctly so&mdash;of indigenous Australians. The government might not like it, some pastoralists might not like it, some miners might not like it, but it is the law of the land and so it ought to be. It is the only way forward for Australia&mdash;a sense of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8892"> security, a sense of opportunity for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, the ruling might be inconvenient to the coalition government. That is why they are prepared to ignore the High Court decision as they run off to church and profess that they want to do something about the disadvantaged in this country. But, when it comes to making hard decisions and taking decisive actions, the real problem is that they will go missing in action in the same way that they have historically gone missing in action when it comes to leadership, commitment and a willingness to do something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that the government's pig&hyphen;headed attitude to Wik may actually become a very costly enterprise to Australia at a time when we need stability and security so as to attract investment and create jobs. I refer to the Australian Law Reform Commission and the fact that it has pointed out and warned that the government's plans for native title will not deliver legal certainty but only deliver very costly litigation&mdash;all the way back to the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, Mr Melham, has correctly tried to constructively argue this same case through the long months of public debate about these amendments, but the government, for some strange reason, has turned a deaf ear to these warnings. I might also say that the government has become very sensitive when it comes to the Wik bill because there is not a favourable legal opinion lodged with the joint committee on native title except&mdash;and we are not surprised&mdash;for the legal opinion from the Attorney-General's Department, from an Attorney&hyphen;General who has a huge question mark over his head today not only with respect to his future capacity to serve in the Howard government but also, more importantly, with respect to his standing in the legal community. And that is not to be dismissed. It is a major problem for the government and it is a major problem for law and order in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the greatest strengths of the Native Title Act as it now stands is that, wherever possible, it minimises the role of lawyers and it minimises the adversarial system of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> courts. The Native Title Act, as it now stands, allows for a resolution of differences in a non&hyphen;adversarial, informal setting with emphasis on mediation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition now wishes to undermine this important process and introduce a costly legal process. Litigation will not only hurt indigenous Australia but hurt the mining and farming communities and the wider economic interests of this nation. This is what this is all about: not just the needs, aspirations and rights of the Australian indigenous community but also the economic needs of a great nation&mdash;the Australian nation&mdash;a nation that ought to be committed to ensuring that we all have the same rights, irrespective of whether they are property rights or opportunities for decent health, education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right to negotiate, I suggest, has been a key part of the Native Title Act and it has been the opposition's contention all along that the decision to extinguish this right will be constitutionally invalid. I believe that this right to negotiate is a crucial element in allowing meaningful input by indigenous people into real decision making&mdash;a sense of emancipation and encouragement to participate&mdash;about the development of their communities, their lands and their futures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the right to negotiate was established, we have seen the indigenous community come up with some creative uses of this new&hyphen;found right. Win&hyphen;win solutions for all Australians have been the end result of that right to negotiate, especially, for example, the negotiated regional agreements which have put a heavy emphasis on a range of core needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My commitment to native title is based on a strong belief that we can only expect to achieve this important goal of reconciliation if we see native title as being part of a wider package which fronts up to the other stark problems that the indigenous community faces in Australia as we approach the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional agreements front up to exactly that issue. People negotiate, through regional agreements, ways to resolve crucial health, education, housing and job issues for indigenous Australians. The ability to come up with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8893"> regional agreements, based on the right to negotiate, has empowered many indigenous communities with the right to determine, often for the first time, their own priorities. A right to have some control of the future will, in time, impact on the stark statistics which confront us when we look at the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to these statistics today because, as far as I am concerned, you cannot separate the Wik debate and the issue of native title from your commitment to do something about the basic issues of health, education and jobs. Reconciliation and an effective Native Title Act should be used by all sides&mdash;yes, all sides&mdash;to ensure that, as we go into the 21st century, we develop acceptable and effective plans to resolve the stark statistics of Aboriginal life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The release of the findings of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander survey in 1995 has widened our knowledge of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. The survey shows that, while a high incidence of health problems such as asthma, hearing problems, heart problems and diabetes were widely reported, access to health care, especially in rural areas, was severely limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal people start life smaller and finish it earlier, with the life expectancy for indigenous females at about 62 years compared to an Australian average of 81 and the life expectancy for indigenous males at 57 compared to an Australian average of 75. At any age, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are more than twice as likely to die as non&hyphen;Aboriginal people. At the most crucial age of 25 to 44, the risk is five times greater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But not all the Aboriginal health statistics are gloomy. The death rate from cardiovascular disease has declined among Aboriginal males. Death from lung cancer is declining among Aboriginal men, although not among women. Alcohol related deaths are declining sharply as are male deaths from car accidents and homicide. The infant mortality rate continues to decline, but its rate of decline appears to have slowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the health problems I have talked about can be tackled if we work with local communities to improve the standard of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Aboriginal housing, which is an acute problem. An indigenous family is 20 times more likely to be homeless than a non&hyphen;indigenous family and four times more likely to be in overcrowded accommodation. At least a quarter of the community lives in unsatisfactory housing. In rural areas, this proportion is roughly one in three. Overcrowding is particularly acute in rural areas where one household in three comprises six or more people, and three&hyphen;quarters of these households had three bedrooms or fewer. In rural areas, about 40 per cent of these houses require major repair or replacement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that I have witnessed a number of places in Queensland, confronted with those difficulties, where this issue is now being effectively tackled by local Aboriginal communities. The communities are using the local housing crisis to provide new skills and to create job and training opportunities for their people and, in doing so, are resolving health problems for their old and young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just outside of Townsville is the Shalom College which is run by the remarkable Uniting Church minister, Shayne Blackman, who has trained young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the skills to build appropriate housing in rural areas. As part of the hands&hyphen;on training at Shalom College, the teenagers and young adults have built nursing homes for their elders and classroom facilities for the younger people attending Shalom College's primary and secondary school. It is about practical outcomes because they have a sense of capacity and opportunity. There are a number of other examples that I could refer to today, but time does not permit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest to you that there are solutions. But the biggest problem confronting indigenous Australia is employment. In some localities, the unemployment rate exceeds 50 per cent but, in the early 1990s, employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people grew more rapidly than non&hyphen;indigenous employment. This was largely due to the major expansion by the Labor Party of the community development employment projects scheme, under which participants have the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8894"> opportunity to work on community projects funded by forgone unemployment benefits. Most of the CDEP work was low skill and part time and, overwhelmingly, it was rural and remote based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the lack of jobs, the lack of education and the lack of skills, the annual income that indigenous Australians earn is very low. Three&hyphen;fifths of people aged 15 or over receive $12,000 or less, while one in nine receive more than $25,000 per annum. Government payments are clearly the main source of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I suggest that the Wik ruling provided new and vital opportunities for indigenous Australians to confront their major social problems, their unemployment problems and the need to skill and train their people for new jobs that could be created by the rights invested in indigenous Australians by the Wik decision. If we are to allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to create new opportunities for themselves, the Howard government should not be actively campaigning to undermine the High Court's Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should act with respect for both the High Court rulings and the newly revived property rights of the first Australians. Some people on the other side might not like it, but the indigenous Australians are the first Australians and they have some rights and entitlements. The High Court has recognised them. It is about time the other side of the House recognised and respected the right of the High Court to make such decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wik ruling can be a godsend for all. I know the `God squad' on the other side of the House do not have a lot of respect for the High Court when it comes to hard decisions. The Wik decision provides a path to help the reconciliation process, a path to help to resolve two centuries of disempowerment which has created the awful statistics which are all too often repeated in discussions about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The time has come to take the hand off the prayer book, the hand off the heart, and to actually do something. Get your hands dirty. Respect the High Court decision, empower 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the indigenous people, respect the fact that in Australia black people as well as white people are entitled to property rights. Give them the capacity to further develop themselves. Give them the capacity to negotiate local arrangements and to do something in a practical way about health, education and the all important employment issues of jobs and training. Take your head out of the sand, stand on your high heels and actually do something rather than just talk about it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech just delivered by the shadow minister, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who is at the table, is undoubtedly one of the most offensive, odious and outrageous speeches ever to be uttered in this place. There is no doubt whatsoever that Aboriginal people are disadvantaged. There is no doubt that much needs to be done to bring their state of health up to the standard of those in the general community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were treated by the shadow minister to a range of Aboriginal health statistics. They were sad statistics. Quite often those statistics were correct. The shadow minister has the hide, the audacity, to come in here in relation to the  Native Title Amendment Bill  and refer to those matters. The shadow minister is a member of a party which, for 13 years, controlled the treasury benches in Australia. For 13 years, that government did absolutely nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has referred the current reference into Aboriginal health to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, which I chaired before my appointment as Government Whip by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The government is absolutely determined to make sure that Aboriginal health and other disadvantage are redressed. The former government spent taxpayers' dollars and loads of this parliament's time talking about the problems of Aborigines and talking about native title but, at the end of the day, Aboriginal health, housing, infant mortality and educational standards remained as they always have been, and that situation is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8895">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Australian people will reject the hypocrisy of the now opposition. They had the hide to criticise this government when this is the first government to do anything. The shadow minister also suggested that we are trying to destroy the High Court decisions in Mabo and Wik. There is no doubt that, prior to the Mabo No. 2 decision in 1992, nobody thought that native title survived. We all believed that the concept of terra nullius was in fact the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the High Court brought down the Mabo decision, it obviously exploded the certainty in land law that was previously there, and the former government brought in the Native Title Act. We then pointed out that that Native Title Act was an unworkable response to the High Court decision. When one listens to speakers from the Labor Party, one would think that that particular piece of legislation is a paragon of virtue. We, in opposition, pointed out that the Native Title Act 1993 was not going to work. Up until the present time, some 612 applications have been lodged before the National Native Tribunal and only one mainland determination has been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have listened to opposition speakers saying how the legislation before the House will destroy the workability of the Native Title Act. What an absolutely sick joke! The Native Title Act has no workability whatsoever. What is more, one of the basic fundamentals on which the act was predicated was exploded when the High Court brought down its decision in the Wik case. It is interesting to look at what the then Prime Minister Keating had to say in the parliament on 16 November 1993 in his second reading speech on the then Native Title Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I draw attention also to the recording in the preamble of the bill of the government's view that under the common law past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title. There is therefore no obstacle or hindrance to renewal of pastoral leases in the future, whether validated or already valid.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There it is was in black and white in the preamble to the legislation. The then Senator Gareth Evans, when talking about preambles said: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We all understand these days the role that preambles have in legislation as an interpretive tool for the courts and as a useful way of expressing the intended scope of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The parliament, in the preamble to the Native Title Act, expressed the view that native title was extinguished by leasehold and freehold grants but, obviously, the court decided otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government accepts the decision in the Mabo case. We also accept the decision in the Wik case, but this legislation seeks to make the Wik decision more workable. Justice Michael Kirby, one of the judges in that case, pointed out that the decision in Wik could well bring about uncertainty. This government has had to redress the uncertainty delivered by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite wrong for the honourable member for Batman to suggest that this government has had a pig&hyphen;headed attitude to Wik. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Senator Minchin) ought to be congratulated for the exemplary way in which he has consulted with all stakeholders in Australia on achieving a situation which means that we are able to bring this bill before the parliament. He has consulted with pastoralists, miners, the indigenous community and with the general community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He ought to be praised for bringing forward this measured response which will seek to reduce uncertainty. It will improve the workability of native title processes and find a balance among the interests of all parties and it will, most importantly, maintain respect for native title. The government said in its election policy that it would amend the Native Title Act to improve its workability, and this legislation before the chamber is the delivery of yet another election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from those people opposite coming in here and seeking to condemn and criticise this government for this bill, they ought to sit back and say that this is another occasion when we did not create the problem but we accept the responsibility to fix it up. This legislation is balanced, reasonable and takes into account the needs of pastoralists, miners and the general community, as well as the Aboriginal community.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want at this stage to refer briefly to the allegations made by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) against the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) in relation to the Australian Law Reform Commission. It ought to be recognised that the Australian Law Reform Commission operates on references given to it by the Attorney&hyphen;General. The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), was Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in the last parliament. I have to concede that he was a pretty good chairman.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Melbourne interjects. He was a much better chairman of that committee than he is shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. Both the Attorney&hyphen;General and I were members of that committee. There was a report brought down in relation to the Australian Law Reform Commission and the chairman, the honourable member for Banks, signed off on that report which indicated that the commission ought only be able to operate in accordance with references given to it by the Attorney&hyphen;General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the Australian Law Reform Commission, we have a gratuitous act by the commission in seeking to buy into the Wik issue and native title. There was no reference given by the minister. The Australian Law Reform Commission takes an extraordinary amount of time in many cases to report on references given to it by the Attorney&hyphen;General of the day. Yet, despite that, it was able to find within its resources the time to put together a submission on Wik.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General has pointed out that the Australian Law Reform Commission is supposed to act on references given to it by the Attorney&hyphen;General. That is the position which was confirmed by a committee chaired by the Labor shadow minister in the last parliament. It has always been the position. Simply put, what has been said is that the Australian Law Reform Commission, in this instance, have overstepped the mark. They have forgotten what their legislation says. They have bought into something where they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do not belong. They do not currently have any reference in relation to native title, yet they have decided to put aside the references given by successive Attorneys&hyphen;General and intrude into something which is not currently their responsibility. I think that is very unacceptable and most regrettable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Banks uttered a few things in his speech that indicated what was wrong with the former government. He showed how out of touch the former government was and the opposition now is with the community. He was divisive. It is very clear that the honourable member for Banks listens only to certain interest groups and does not consider the interests of mainstream Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Melbourne ought to be ashamed of himself. Once I used to think that he was a person who had some ability. Clearly, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is still concerned about the member for Melbourne. On this issue the member for Melbourne is totally wrong. He ought to support the position enunciated by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we had the Mabo decision in 1992, we had the Native Title Act in 1993 which, I might add, was opposed by the then opposition at the time, and then we had the Wik decision brought down this year. This government has not rushed into a quick fix solution with respect to Wik. As I said, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister has consulted widely right across the Australian community with a view to obtaining a balance. I pointed out that he has spoken to pastoralists, indigenous interests, states and territories and also to industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These proposals currently before the parliament seek to achieve a number of outcomes. Those outcomes include legal validity for acts done between the commencement of the Native Title Act in January 1994 and the Wik decision on the assumption that pastoral leases and other tenures extinguished native title. The proposals also seek to restore certainty to pastoralists so that they can carry on primary production activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We seek to have respect for native title, preserving the principle of native title as established in the Mabo case in allowing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> claims to proceed. Of course, that explodes the suggestions made by the honourable member for Batman who tries to point out that we are seeking to destroy the Mabo and Wik decisions. The proposals also will confirm the common law relating to native title and, in particular, that it is extinguished by current and historical freehold, residential leases, commercial leases, and those agricultural and pastoral leases providing exclusive possession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also aim to improve workability through removing impediments to developing and building on the government's proposed amendments to improve the processes of the Native Title Act 1993. The proposals also include devolution to the states and territories and, in particular, allowing for alternative state and territory processes for granting mining leases on pastoral lease land. We also aim for a speedy and sustainable resolution of concerns and uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people were not happy with what the Prime Minister included in the 10&hyphen;point plan. It is interesting that some people said that the government did not go far enough and others said that the government went too far. That probably indicates that the government has it exactly right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has shown exemplary leadership in relation to Wik. It would be very easy for us to rush off and urge wholesale extinguishment of native title by pastoral leases. It would have been easy for us to be populists and to go out there and say what many people wanted to hear. But the Prime Minister on this issue, as on the guns issue, and as on so many other issues, has shown himself to be a statesman. He has been prepared to spend an inordinate amount of time working out a position which is fair and equitable to all sides. That is why I am particularly proud to support this legislation which is currently before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people have said that there ought to be wholesale extinguishment. I can understand the superficial attractiveness of that approach. However, to have blanket extinguishment would undermine the very certainty and security sought to be brought about by this legislation. Our pastoralists, in particular, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8898"> would be affected in a number of ways. Were we to go down the extinguishment road there would be legal problems, and it would considerably increase the likelihood of a successful constitutional challenge to the validity of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Claims, of course, would not disappear, they would simply manifest themselves as claims for compensation. There would be more time lost and there would be more paralysis. There would be substantial compensation paid for extinguishing native title. The courts, on a case by case basis, would have to decide what compensation would be paid in individual circumstances and there could be millions if not billions of dollars paid out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, one really has to be practical in politics. Life is not the art of the possible, it is the art of the attainable. While we achieved a massive majority in the last election&mdash;the people of Australia resoundingly voted for the Howard coalition government&mdash;regrettably, owing to vagaries in the Senate voting system, we did not obtain a similar majority in the upper house. As a government we had to be aware that we must bring in reforms to the Native Title Act but it was important that, if they were going to be workable, if they were going to come into effect, we get them through the upper house. It was made very clear by the Labor Party and by the minor parties in the Senate that, were we to go down the wholesale extinguishment road, our legislation would be unlikely to be passed by the Senate and there would be an indefinite continuity of uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very many proposals in this legislation of a technical nature which substantially improve the workability of the Native Title Act, and there was no point in our making a great big noise and bringing forward proposals for wholesale extinguishment which would have resulted in increased legal cases. It would have resulted in an enormous amount of financial outlay, even if we could have got the proposals through the parliament. But it is obvious we would not have got them through the parliament and so there really is a very practical as well as a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> moral reason for not proceeding down the road of wholesale extinguishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, there were downsides for the Australian community generally if we were to go down the road of wholesale extinguishment. It would risk the reconciliation process. The honourable member for Batman said that we were not committed to reconciliation. That is absolutely untrue. This government and ministers have pointed out that we are committed to the reconciliation of Aboriginal and non&hyphen;Aboriginal Australians, and I think the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) would agree that this is a bipartisan approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) actually sits on the national council with respect to reconciliation. So it is quite wrong, it is very dishonest&mdash;and I am pleased to see that the member for Melbourne is nodding&mdash;to suggest that this government does not support the principle of reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as our international reputation is concerned, it would also have been damaged were we to go down the road of wholesale extinguishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum up, as time is short, this is a very important piece of legislation. We are seeking through this legislation to fix up a problem which was left to us by our predecessors. This bill is balanced, it is fair, it is workable, it is equitable and it will be to the benefit of the indigenous people of Australia. It will also be to the benefit of miners; it will be to the benefit of the tourist industry and also of pastoralists. So this bill is a win/win/win/win situation. Those opposite stand condemned for their negativity, for their failure in government to do anything about Aboriginal people and for their bringing to Australia the Native Title Act, which has proven so far to be absolutely and completely unworkable. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt the long&hyphen;term goal of the Aboriginal industry is to create a separate indigenous nation within Australia: a separate country that the allegedly guilty non&hyphen;Aboriginal Australians will pay for. This is a clear and indisputable fact that will disturb all Australians who believe we are working for the future as one people. The concept and general understanding of `indigenous' has been created with dubious purpose and dangerous intent. The true and much broader meaning of `indigenous' is not generally 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8900"> understood, and as it stands it is meant to confuse and deceive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is most important for us all to be Australians. How long you or your ancestors may have been here is irrelevant. It is a flawed argument to essentially suggest that some people are more Australian than others when some of us were born here and others have chosen to become Australians&mdash;either we are equal in all things or equal in none. When what is indigenous, what is Australian and levels of Aboriginality are mixed with the fact that the greater majority of so&hyphen;called indigenous people are of mixed ancestry, often with only small percentages of Aboriginal blood, confusion of identity and entitlement reigns supreme. What is certain however is that, to progress together as one people, we must all be treated equally and not separated for special treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, Aborigines comprise less than two per cent of our population yet, under native title, they will claim perhaps as much as 75 per cent of land that is supposed to belong to us all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that many Aboriginal people are not working and that they are living in appalling conditions. The current situation, with the corrupt and inefficient activities of ATSIC, does not allow much opportunity for improving their lifestyle. However, they do not have a monopoly on being disadvantaged, as it is also true that a million other Australians are not working and, although they feel little hope for the future, no&hyphen;one is giving them land. Rather, you are taking the land that belongs to us all and making it the sole property of the few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am accused of trying to turn back the clock to the 1950s but the government, by refusing to extinguish so&hyphen;called native title, is turning the clock back to the 1780s.

Section 9 of that act makes it unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of any human right or fundamental freedom. Section 10 of the act provides that if, by reason of a law of the Commonwealth, state or territory, persons of a particular race, the first group, do not enjoy a right that is enjoyed by persons of another race, the second group, or enjoy a right to a more limited extent then, notwithstanding that law, the first group are to enjoy the right to the same extent as the second group.

This should be put to the Australian people in the form of a referendum to be held concurrently with the next federal election. If I had the opportunity to move an amendment to the Native Title Bill, I would move that consideration of the bill be deferred until the electors of Australia are given the opportunity to express their opinion by way of referendum.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the evening of Thursday, 25 November 1993 I rose in this House to oppose the Native Title Bill, as it then was. I asked the assembled members of this house a question: could it be that once again regional Australia had been asked to carry the heaviest load? Over those intervening years the answer has reverberated a very clear yes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8901">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That evening in Canberra in l993, I pleaded with the parliament to understand that the ideas and the concepts they were playing around with were highly dangerous. The legislation that the government was supporting would divide this nation and the Aboriginal people of Australia would not gain one iota from the passage of that bill. Unfortunately, and I say this with no sense of pleasure, I believe that I was right. That evening my arguments were intended for the ears of Labor's then regional members. One characteristic shared by those honourable members at that time is that at the subsequent election they were unceremoniously thrown from office partly because of, I believe, the betrayal in that summer of l993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disastrous effects of the astonishing judgment of the High Court of Australia in the l996 Wik decision and the deceit of the Keating&hyphen;Beazley government in passing the Native Title Act have engulfed all quarters of our nation, not simply the entire regional section of the parliamentary Labor Party. Let us look at the native title impact on Australia today. The facts are obvious. Seventy-eight per cent of Australia is potentially subject to native title claim. That is undisputed. There has been only one negotiated successful claim in five years despite $88.8 million worth of funding through the representative bodies. I understand that is something like 600 claims and that everyone is aware of the overlapping claims issue. For instance, in my own electorate of Grey there is more native title claimed than actually exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most obvious effect has been the shutdown of minerals and resource development in this country. Already, in the three years from the Mabo judgment, offshore mining increased as a percentage of mining activity by Australian companies from 27 per cent to 41 per cent as Australia's miners were forced to halt activity in their own country. This is equivalent to around $486 million flying out of Australia in a single year. Yet Labor's Special Minister for State, the then member for Robertson, Frank Walker, now replaced by my colleague Jim Lloyd, told the House, `I think that those who are suggesting 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that there will be some loss of investment are simply wrong.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Were that were so. Our farmers have been devastated by the High Court's decision and the subsequent acts of the Commonwealth. Even advocates such as Rick Farley, who many believe sold out his fellow farmers in l993, have been forced to admit that farmers have been stymied by the Native Title Act. The Wik decision of last year has exacerbated such concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to the impact on my own electorate of Grey. By its very nature, my electorate has borne the brunt of much of the uncertainty of native title, remembering that it is 92 per cent of the land mass of South Australia. To be truthful, I wonder if my very presence in this parliament did not prejudice the efforts of my electorate to get a decent hearing from the previous government. Would they have had such disregard for the people of the north of South Australia if there had been a Labor member for Grey at the time? Regrettably the answer is yes for even the protestations of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) who was dumped by the ALP for his efforts was unable to shift the Keating&hyphen;Beazley mind&hyphen;set.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to a report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of some criticism made of Australia's position by Denmark. I will take the opportunity in replying to the honourable member for Hindmarsh to mention to the House that Denmark's environment minister, Mr Sven Auken, has criticised Australia's claims for what he describes as `special consideration'. Let me start by saying that Australia is not seeking special consideration; Australia is merely seeking fair consideration. I notice the Labor Party is once again siding with foreign criticism, as they always do. They always side with foreign criticism. Whenever the Australian national interest is at stake they always agree with those who criticise Australia. But may I take the opportunity of saying that, of all those who might choose to criticise Australia's position, Denmark is in a particularly vulnerable position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that Denmark is in a particularly vulnerable position is that Denmark herself is part of some special arrangements that exist. For example, Danish statistics relating to CO2 emissions claim that emissions of CO2 fell by 0.5 per cent in 1996. However&mdash;and this is the interesting part, Mr Speaker&mdash;this was achieved by deducting 13 million tonnes of emissions from energy exports to Norway and Sweden. Denmark's electricity, therefore, went into a black hole. While they talk about Nordic power sharing, neither Norway nor Sweden counted the emissions either. So, somehow or other, some of the European countries who, with Labor Party support here, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adopt this self&hyphen;righteous position and point the finger at Australia and say that Australia is asking for special treatment, themselves have some extraordinary special arrangements. According to my advice, if we adopted the Danish method we could all get our figures down but the environment would be no better off. Mr Speaker, can I say to Denmark, can I say to the energy minister of Denmark, and can I say to all the supporters of the Danish position who sit opposite that we are sticking up for the Australian national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is involved in this greenhouse gas debate is a threat to 90,000 Australian jobs. What is involved in this greenhouse debate is an attempt by the Australian government to stick up for the Australian interest. Those who criticise our stance and those opposite who support the critics of our stance are doing the Australian national interest in the eye. What I am arguing for, what I will continue to argue for and what my government will continue to argue for is a fair deal for Australia: not a special deal for Australia, not a Labor deal for Australia but a fair deal for Australia; a deal that will protect Australian industry and, even more importantly, protect and generate Australian jobs.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I know it is of great importance to him and to many other members. The gifting arrangements are a new policy and they are part of Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia. It sees the government delivering on a longstanding commitment to address a very real need: the welfare need of aged farmers and the very difficult circumstances which have confronted Australian farmers over the last decade or so. The fact is that there are thousands of older farmers living on farms with the next generation, and sometimes the generation after that&mdash;their sons and daughters, and sometimes their grandchildren&mdash;where that farm can no longer provide what ordinary Australians would regard as a decent standard of living for more than one family. And certainly not for two or three, as is sometimes the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of those farms once would have been able to, but relentlessly declining terms of trade have overcome many farm families, despite the sector's legendary reputation for improving productivity and doing the job more effectively. Many of these people find that they are just unable to live decently, yet they cannot access the age pension because of the way in which the asset tests impacts on them. Our policy will enable farmers in this situation to transfer ownership of the family farm to a younger generation who are actively involved in running the business and then to receive the age pension immediately instead of, as currently applies, five years down the road. This will benefit not just those older farmers but also the younger generation taking over. They will be able to pick up the reins, relieved of a substantial financial pressure. They will be in a better position, so will those farms and so will the national economy. This is a carefully targeted package which is not available to wealthy farmers but which will be of real value to those many, many hard&hyphen;pressed farmers out there in real need. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be particularly interested to know just what conclusions about this gifting provision my opposite number, the shadow minister for primary industries, has now reached. His reaction to this package, which was so widely welcomed by the farm leaders in this country, was that it was a cruel hoax and constituted a few things which were a pale imitation of what they had in place. It would be interesting to know what his attitude is now.</PARA>

He has been out there saying that the Leader of the Opposition has given them a blank page on which to start setting out a rural policy. In fact, he recently said, `Kim Beazley has given me a total blank sheet.' It is probably very much like the one they took to the last election. It was a blank sheet. There was nothing on it. They did not have a primary industry policy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He quoted the Leader of the Opposition as having said, `Rural and regional Australia is at the heart of Labor's comeback.'

I wonder, Mr Speaker, could we table the Labor Party's rural policy? Could I have your permission to table it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Filling in the gaps would be a very worthwhile exercise on the part of my opposite number over there because we need to know what it is about. All we know at the moment is that, from his reaction to this package, which has been so widely welcomed in rural Australia, the blank page will not have on it gifting, farm management deposits, farm family restart, Farmbis or anything else that is in the AAA package, the Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia package, because he says that it is just a cruel hoax.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

They have had to have their families, their legal advisers or the guardianship boards in each of the states and territories, look after their interests. The policy has worked well in hostels.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, let me remind the House that it was Labor which allowed hostels to charge any level of additional daily fee they wanted to. They could take everything from the resident over and above the pension and the little bit of money a pensioner could earn before their pension was affected. If they earned $20, under their policy the hostels could take $10 of that money. That was the kind of policy that that mob over there introduced when they were in government. We have put a stop to that. Basically, Labor failed. They failed the aged sector in this country. They failed the frail elderly in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. This is a matter of very considerable interest on this side of the House. Yesterday the government announced some important reforms to the child support scheme to take effect in 1998&hyphen;99. The package represents a balanced approach, and it focuses on the interests of children and the balance of responsibility between both parents and fairness to taxpayers generally. The fact is that there are 155,000 payees who will benefit from the introduction of a minimum child support payment of $260 a year. This initiative will reinforce the message that parents have primary responsibility for the financial support of their children. Three hundred thousand payers will pay less child support as a result of an increase in the exempt income amount, and 96,000 payees will have some of this reduction offset through increased family payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The additional relief will be provided to blended families through allowing child support payments to be taken into account for family payment purposes. Furthermore, the amount of income the payee will be allowed to earn before it affects child support will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8916"> significantly reduced. The non&hyphen;agency payments in arrears received with the first regular payment of child support will be treated in the same way as other child support under the maintenance income test.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other reforms include allowing parents to use the most recent taxable income assessment for the calculation of child support and broadening the income base to ensure that payers are not avoiding their responsibilities through minimisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further administrative reforms will be introduced to the Child Support Agency to build on the significant reforms that have already been made. We recognise that these measures are a second important step in the process of child support reform, and that continued consultation is required. I can assure the honourable member and members such as her who are interested in this matter that we will be seeking to inform at the next stage. I am sure honourable members will be very pleased to note that, after 13 years of inactivity by the former government, this is a government prepared to address these sensitive issues.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

A member of my staff continued on the flight to Dalby, which was in any case heading back to its base at Orungal, near Texas. It was a dead leg anyway. The stop at Dalby was offered by the pilot at no extra cost to the Commonwealth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From today, older Australians and their families will know what this Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and this government are doing to nursing home care in this country. Today it gets real for this minister. From today, nursing home care will no longer be available to all Australians on the basis of their health need. From today, older Australians too frail and too sick to care for themselves will no longer be automatically guaranteed a bed in a nursing home as the means of getting the care they need. From today, the traumatic process of arranging nursing home care for an older relative has just become more traumatic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now clear that, from today, older frail Australians will be paying up to $98,000 to get a nursing home bed. Most people can find that sort of money only in one place: their family home. They do not have it tucked away somewhere else. They do not have it in their back pocket. They have it in one place: their family home. Their family home will have to be sold from today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Howard government slashed more than half a billion dollars from aged care in the 1996 budget, and that is at the heart of the problem. Half a billion dollars has been taken 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8921"> from the aged care budget. In order to make up this deficiency and to find the capital necessary, the Howard government has come up with this appalling user-pays system of new fees for nursing homes. This Howard government and this minister have introduced this up-front fee, the so-called accommodation bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November, the extra daily fee will begin. The extra daily fee is, of course, just a tax by another name. It really rubs salt into the wounds of older people. The money goes straight to the government, and the residents get no benefit from that payment whatsoever. This minister has been steadfast in her refusal to acknowledge the facts about where the money will come from to pay this $98,000 entry fee. As the facts mount from today, she is looking more and more like King Canute in her efforts to deny the obvious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The money for the entry fee will come from the sale of people's homes. Let us just briefly walk through the facts one more time. The majority of people in nursing homes are pensioners. Pensioners, Minister! More than 70 per cent of pensioners have only one asset: their family home. Yes, there are exemptions&mdash;I am sure the minister will talk about them&mdash;when a spouse lives in the home. But the facts are that 90 per cent of the people who need to go into a nursing home live alone before they go into that nursing home. They will have to sell their family homes. You might like to say that nobody will be forced. This is the biggest playing with words that I have ever seen. Of course it is not compulsory, Minister, but where does compulsion end and coercion begin? The nursing homes will coerce older people to sell their homes so that they pay the $98,000 in entry fees. The fact is they will have to sell their homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget which people we are talking about here. This is a generation of people, unlike my generation, which  has lived through the Great Depression and the Second World War. They have scrimped and saved to pay their bills to give their children&mdash;people of your and my generation&mdash;advantages that they never had. One of the major objectives of that generation, one of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> major objectives of their lives, was to pay off the family home. Minister, part of the cruelty of this legislation is that you do not seem to understand the psychological impact of what you are doing to this generation of Australians. You are trashing the values of a generation. The action is arrogant and contemptuous in its failure to understand the impact it will have on older Australians and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me share one example with you. It comes from a personal friend of mine. I will not use her name because she would not want me to. Her mother and father have just gone through a very difficult time. Her father has very severe dementia and was becoming very violent towards her mother. They had to find a nursing home bed for her father. They went to many nursing homes in the local area&mdash;I think five or six. None of the nursing homes wanted to take this man because he is violent and disruptive. But something had to be done to protect the mother. They could not find a nursing home bed. Eventually, this man had to be committed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This family is saying to me, `Imagine having to deal with a nursing home saying, "No, we're not taking him. He's too difficult a patient. By the way, you haven't got $98,000 either."' This is because the mother is still living in the home. `"You haven't got the money. He's too difficult a patient."' That is the sort of attitude that will take place in our nursing home system as a result of the changes that start today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have another example. A letter came into my office from a lady who is 64 years of age. She has looked after her father, who is 90 years old, for three years. He has dementia. As she says in her letter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Try caring for a dementia stricken person for 3 weeks and tell me you can do it forever. I am on anti depressants for the first time in my life. I no longer have a life. Why should it end at 64? I was a healthy, active, alive person&mdash;not any more.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`Don't tell me that I won't have to sell my home because I have only been looking after my father for three years, not for 5 years.' This woman is not protected by your legislation. She will have to sell her home to get her father into a nursing home because she can no longer look after him. That will be the real 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8922"> effect on families of this abominable piece of legislation that has been introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course the tragedy and the farce of this legislation do not end there. We will eventually go from a system of care that guaranteed a place to people on the basis of their health needs to one where different levels of care will emerge, depending on how much people can pay. What an abomination. What an un&hyphen;Australian way of looking after people in their last years of life. It is inevitable that raising money through the entry fee system will produce a system that reflects where the money comes from. In other words, it will reflect the capacity of nursing homes to tap into the value of people's homes. Nursing homes in wealthy areas&mdash;as this article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> clearly shows&mdash;where there are high property values will be able to get the $98,000. The government has talked about getting $1.5 billion from this system through the sale of people's homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the nursing homes in poorer areas, in country towns or the poorer parts of our cities where they can only pay a smaller amount? As is made quite clear in the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>, it is about to start; it will start today. There are places in Sydney that will charge only $30,000. Those places will, of course, end up as second&hyphen;rate nursing homes. Those that charge $98,000 will be very nice, thanks very much. We have seen from the newspapers today that nursing homes are already saying that poorer areas and lower fees will go together. We have evidence, Minister, that you are responsible. This minister will stand condemned for introducing a two&hyphen;tiered system into our nursing home care: one system for the rich and another much lesser system for the poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course it will take time for these controversial changes to work through the system. We know what that means, Minister. Over the next 12 months or so this generation of people who pay their $98,000 to get into a nursing home will not get anything for it because, unfortunately, it is the case that people do not live for a very long time in nursing homes. They will pay these huge up&hyphen;front fees and get no benefit whatsoever. The nursing homes will not be upgraded in their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lifetimes. They will have sold their homes, sold the one thing that they own, and will get no benefit whatsoever in their lifetimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government keeps trying to talk up a crisis in nursing home care to justify its actions. Minister, there is not a crisis yet but, sure as heck, one is coming. The way this government is going about these changes there will soon be a crisis in our nursing home system, because the other thing that has become very clear in the newspapers today is that about 15 per cent of homes have failed the certification test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings in the big catch&hyphen;22 in this legislation: the test that means that if you need capital to upgrade you definitely will not be able to get it because you cannot charge an accommodation bond. While it is true that substandard homes should never be condoned, this government has shown the height of irresponsibility by being willing to wash its hands of the problems it will create. The minister was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> today saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unfortunate. Some of those homes will close because of being unable to charge accommodation bonds.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This minister is completely irresponsible because she has not allocated anything like enough money to make sure these nursing homes have the capital they need to upgrade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure she will say that the government has allocated funds. Let me tell the public: it is $10 million, which might build 2&half; nursing homes. That is all. Where will the people go who have to leave the 300 nursing homes which are expected to fail the inspection? Where will the nursing home residents go?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister just wants to wash her hands of it. She is not going to provide the funding for the 300 nursing homes that will close as a result of her incompetent legislation. Minister, you cannot walk away from the ripple effect that this is going to have throughout the whole nursing home sector. Where will the residents from the nursing homes that are closed go? Will they stay in public hospitals?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will not be able to stay in public hospitals. The Australian Medical Association 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8923"> are going to put paid to that idea. They will not stand for nursing home patients staying in public hospitals. They wanted your legislation deferred for 10 years. That is how concerned they are about what will happen to public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments are elected to govern, not to shrug their shoulders and look away and say that it is up to market forces. That is what this minister is doing: leaving it to market forces; leaving it to user pays. If you have got $98,000 it will be just fine for you. You will be able to get into a nursing home, you will be fine, you will be looked after. If you have got $30,000, you might get into a second-rate nursing home. But, if you have nothing, you go to the back of the queue. That will be the result of this minister's new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only will they get nothing, but if they do manage to get into a nursing home they will get second&hyphen;rate care. That is an abomination to the Australian people and something that we should be totally ashamed of.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The untruths and distortions spread by the opposition and vested interests have done nothing but scare and humiliate old people, turning them into political footballs. This debate today is the shadow minister's last-ditch effort to throw a bit more mud, to spread a few more untruths to disgracefully scare some more elderly and frail Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the very first day of this debate, all the opposition has done is play a totally divisive and negative game. That has been the sum total of the opposition's contribution to this debate on aged care. Not once have we had any acceptance of the parlous state of affairs that nursing homes were left in as a result of the funding system so badly neglected under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not once have we had any evidence that the shadow minister has been anywhere near some of the older nursing homes, particularly in her state, where a good proportion of nursing homes are simply old houses converted for the purpose. Until today, not once had we had any acknowledgment by the shadow minister of the totally inadequate funding provided for people with dementia under the current system, and the desperate need, as she highlighted&mdash;thus highlighting Labor's failure&mdash;to develop more appropriate funding and care for dementia patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not once have we had any acknowledgment that they even care about the 40 per cent of residents that share wards with four or more people, the 11 per cent of facilities that do not meet fire standards or the 15 per cent that do not meet health standards. Does the shadow minister deny these figures and the disgraceful stories behind such statistics? Her silence to date indicates such outrageous denial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me explain what these statistics mean, particularly for residents' quality of life. They mean that too many buildings have serious structural deficiencies. They mean that there are hazards which jeopardise residents' safety and security. They mean an unsafe working environment for staff.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8924">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are many institutional buildings with dark narrow corridors with inadequate lighting. This restricts residents' mobility, further hampering their capacity to enjoy a high quality of life. There are also small narrow toilets, perhaps shared between many residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some buildings have multiple storeys with no lifts, further restricting mobility. Some buildings have a sterile hospital&hyphen;like environment which, despite the best efforts of the dedicated staff and providers, are far from homelike. Too many nursing home buildings are serious firetraps. There may be no firewalls, the fire exits could be blocked or even locked. The windows might not open, or perhaps the fire exits open to enclosed courtyards, not allowing residents to escape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are too many people living in a room with four, six, eight or more beds. This means rows of beds sometimes less than a metre apart&mdash;bed after bed after bed. This cramped accommodation means no privacy. It means barely any room for personal belongings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's response was an abject failure. It cut funding on capital expenditure while not allowing nursing home providers to charge bonds. The shadow minister was quite wrong when she said in the House that we have provided only $10 million.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MACKLIN" NAMEID="PG6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PG6">Ms Macklin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A year.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4V5">Mrs MOYLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have provided $10 million a year, that is correct, but you did not say `a year'; you just said $10 million. What Labor did in 1992-93 was allocate $45 million for nursing home capital purposes. By 1995-96, this dropped to $10.7 million&mdash;a 75 per cent reduction in capital funding. Even worse, only $2.7 million of that was for upgrading old and substandard services. The rest went to build new services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From such a parlous state it is no longer possible to keep placing bandaids on the problem. The wound is festering and it is getting worse. Rather than just ignore it, as Labor did, our reforms will fix it. Our reforms acknowledge that, in stark contrast to nursing home buildings, hostels generally offer a much better standard of accommodation. This is no accident.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's hostel policy introduced in 1988 and supported by us meant that hostels had an income stream to significantly finance their own upgrade and refurbishment. This income stream was called entry contributions and now accommodation bonds. Accommodation bonds across both hostels and nursing homes will provide an income stream of some $130 million each year after four years. This matches well with Professor Gregory's estimation that around $125 million a year is needed to bring the nursing home buildings up to reasonable community expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is painfully obvious that the opposition had never had any intention of being a constructive player in this debate and has no understanding of the conditions of the buildings that many residents find themselves living in today. Let me take this opportunity to put some facts on the table, given the shadow minister has decided to ignore them. The reforms that we will implement today will deliver on a number of fronts. I will briefly mention just 10 of those points. Nursing home building quality will improve. People will be housed in a safe environment where they will have comfort and dignity in their most frail years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will have improved funding for dementia. The new funding system will deliver a substantial increase to funding for dementia&mdash;about a 30 per cent increase on average to a hostel resident with dementia. This will relieve the financial strain on dementia-specific facilities and improve access to dementia care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Higher levels of funding will be guaranteed for providers who care for financially disadvantaged people. Under the current system, providers receive a meagre subsidy of $3.50 per day for financially disadvantaged people. Under our system that amount will more than double to $7 a day and it will go to $12 a day if the provider cares for more than 40 per cent of financially disadvantaged residents. This will provide much greater support for providers in poorer areas and those who specialise in financially disadvantaged residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also provide greater services in rural and remote areas. The special viability assistance funding was previously available 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8925"> only to nursing homes. This has been extended to hostels as well. Facilities in remote areas in particular tend to have higher proportions of financially disadvantaged residents and so will benefit greatly from the higher funding levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, facilities in rural and remote areas will be targeted by the government's capital grants program which provides additional assistance to help facilitates build or upgrade. For this $40 million was announced in the 1996 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Facilities can also choose to broaden the range of care they provide and be funded for. So residents will increasingly be able to stay in their own towns rather than move to get the care they need. That is very important to rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will also be comprehensive access protection for financially disadvantaged people. Much stronger and clearer protection than ever existed in the past will ensure that older Australians get access to care according to their need, not according to their means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the shadow minister was asked on radio in Perth this morning what the Labor Party would do if it were to lay down a policy, she said, `We would make sure people get access according to their needs, not according to their means.' That is exactly what this policy does. All nursing homes and hostels will have to set aside a proportion of places for people who cannot afford to pay a bond. Providers will receive higher subsidies for those places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also new rules for the family home. For the first time, they are designed to protect spouses, dependent children, close family members and carers who received no special treatment under the system Labor had in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new accreditation arrangements, which will be supervised by an independent board, will ensure that all facilities meet standards. This will mean an improved quality of care and quality of life for all residents. The facilities that are failing these basic tests are a stark reminder of Labor's neglect of the nursing home sector and its appalling report card in properly caring for our frail aged.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The new system breaks down artificial barriers between nursing homes and hostels, and funds people according to their care need, not what sort of facility they happen to be in. The reforms introduce new and stronger consumer safeguards. We launched one of those products this morning which was very well received. These changes will ensure a system of quality care sustainable for the coming decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important also to look at the needs of elderly people outside of residential care and to put the reforms into perspective. Not once have we heard any comment from the opposition on the need of the other sector of our older population. Not once have we had any acknowledgment that only seven to 10 per cent of older people rely on residential care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people are the forgotten people from the previous government. But, finally, we have implemented many changes to assist people to retain their independence. We have established the Conference for Older Australians. We have established a healthy senior task force to develop programs and activities for older people in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the government's age care reform package will bring significant and lasting reform to nursing homes in a way that will make them viable and sustainable well into the future. It will ensure that frail older people will have equitable access to high standards of care and accommodation and that, as their care needs increase over time, they will not have to face the trauma of moving to another facility to get appropriate care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package will introduce strong protections for consumers and create incentives for providers to continue to invest in maintenance and improvements to building stock. It will ensure that access to quality care is based on care need and not on means to pay. It is based on people's need, on the clinically assessed needs by the ACATS team&mdash;not on people's capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are some of the pillars upon which our reforms are built, born of consultation and a responsible public policy approach&mdash;a far cry from what we get from the opposition, which is just a series of distortions and

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let no&hyphen;one say that those opposite have not been warned. The Labor Party, led by the champion of Australia's frail fraternity, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), has warned that these controversial aged care changes will devastate the residential aged care sector. But do not just take it from us, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8927"> Mr Deputy Speaker, concerned and compassionate though we may be. Take a warning, departed Minister, from the Anglican Archbishop of Perth, the Most Reverend Dr Carnley, and also the Moderator of the Uniting Church in the minister's state of WA, Reverend Dunn, who called on the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to delay these disgraceful changes for 12 months. Not only that, but the archbishop raised the possibility of a hidden agenda which may favour what he called profit seekers in the aged care industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But before I turn to the archbishop's warning on profit seekers, tempted though I may be to raise the likes of Doug Moran immediately, let me inform the House of why those opposite are seeking to implement these most heinous of changes. The government needs the money to pay for nursing home upgrades because it withdrew half a billion dollars from aged care in the 1996 budget. The government considers that this money can be found only in the most rotten and despicable of ways: by making aged people sell off their homes if they need to enter a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the fatal flaws of this legislation is that if nursing homes want to charge an entry fee and get access to this money then they have got to go through a process of being certified as having buildings of a reasonable standard. The catch&hyphen;22 of this fatally flawed legislation is that nursing homes need to improve accommodation standards. If a nursing home has substandard buildings that need repair, it will fail the certification process and will, therefore, be unable to charge an entry fee and obviously be unable to fix itself up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is stupid, as the member for Namadgi has rightly interjected. If this money is not going to needy nursing homes, then where is it going? Think the archbishop's warning. Think profit seekers. Think the likes of Doug Moran. The clear losers in all of this are the aged Australians in genuine need of nursing home care. The winners are the likes of Doug Moran and his Moran Health Care Group. This is the very same Doug Moran who boasted on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>  earlier this year that he was the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government's main adviser in the area of aged care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also confirmed to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> on 27 August that he had significant influence on the government's aged care policy. This same Doug Moran, who made $250 million out of aged care, putting him at No. 40 on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS> top 200 rich list, has been in rapid expansion mode ever since in anticipation of the financial windfalls this legislation will bring his group. Of course this group was selected to privately develop five Victorian state government nursing homes and keep the profits. The same group is also developing a new nursing home in Rose Bay in Sydney. The same group also goes under the name of Western Health Care Ltd in Western Australia where it is a large concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is opportune to again heed Reverend Carnley's warning&mdash;and I return to his letter to the Prime Minister dated 3 September 1997&mdash;where, in part, Reverend Carnley says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it may be that a hidden agenda is operating in relation to these matters which seek to diminish the role of not for profit providers by favouring the profit seekers in the industry. I think this kind of suggestion has a potential to explode into the most horrendous disruption of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To return one last time to the Moran group, an extract from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS>  of that same date, 27 August of this year, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chief Executive Officer of the Moran Group, Mr Shane Moran&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the rather incestuous company that it is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">told the Sunday Age that his company had increased its nursing home investments in the expectation that the government would introduce legislation. Asked if this was the case Mr Shane Moran said: `I suppose so.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a damning indictment of the performance of this government and its intimate association with those who men of the cloth have suggested are profit seekers, who profit from being in bed with government&mdash;the same government that is forcing the aged to near debt just to get a bed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt two tiers of care will result from these changes. A survey of Sydney nursing homes in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> revealed a fee range of $30,000 to $90,000. The $30,000 fees were concentrated in the lower 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8928"> income areas of Sydney. Undoubtedly homes in those areas will have less money available to them. Many people in these areas will clearly be unable to afford entry fees, driving down the level of overall care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to draw the minister's attention to a well-known fact that seems to have escaped her, that being that hostels and nursing homes, until today, were in no way the same. Comparing hostels to nursing homes is like comparing hospitals to hotels because both have beds. It is like comparing bikes to semi-trailers because both have wheels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hostels were established to accommodate&mdash;and I stress the word `accommodate'&mdash;older people who made a deliberate decision to move into accommodation that offered a degree of supporter living. That they now contain a growing number of people who are increasingly frail is because they are growing older. Another fact that seems to have escaped this minister is that we all do grow old. But the key point is that residents of hostels have decided&mdash;and again I emphasise `decided'&mdash;to sell up and move into hostels. That they may be frail now does not mean that they were frail or incapacitated when they decided to move into the hostel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nursing homes, on the other hand, clearly are for seriously ill or seriously frail people who are unable to look after themselves. You do not go into a nursing home by choice, Minister. I know that is one of your favourite words, but it does not apply in this instance. People go into nursing homes when they are assessed as being unable to care for themselves. They are assessed by aged care assessment teams, usually comprising a doctor, nurse, social worker and perhaps a gerontologist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was said on radio this morning that the government expect to raise $1.5 billion by coercing people to sell their homes. The minister says that Labor has run nursing homes down. Labor acknowledges that nursing homes needed money spent on them. Indeed, it was there in our own forward estimates. That is where the Liberals have made their half a billion dollar saving. When money needed to be put in they cut half a billion dollars out in last year's budget. They 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> plan to generate some $1.5 billion by making people sell their homes, resulting in profits galore for people like Doug Moran, the government's self-confessed aged care adviser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where this money is going. Nursing home care under this government is allocated clearly on the basis of wealth, not health. This government might as well nail down the coffin lids of Australia's aged because they will certainly be dancing on the coalition's grave come the next election.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been absolutely appalled by the standard of argument put forward by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton). Let us just look at some facts. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) outlined the facts of this case, something that members opposite would not have a clue about. All they stand up here and do is belt rhetoric time and time again without once addressing the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back to 1988 when you introduced a payment to go into hostels, supported by this party. I happen to have been in the health care industry. Before I entered parliament I had the displeasure to go through some nursing homes and hostels. I could not understand why hostels seemed to be such wonderful places, such new pristine environments, which you would be happy to have one of your own live in. Then on the same day you would be forced into a nursing home which was dark, dingy, smelly, almost a fire hazard and a risk to people's health. That is what the opposition condemned them to. Here we are some nine years later, and what are they saying? We want more of the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that when it comes to standards some people set low standards and fail to achieve them. This crowd does not even have standards in any form of any policy. We have seen that today in relation to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the Clayton's opposition leader, who will not deal with his recalcitrant senator. We have seen it in relation to health care. We have seen it in relation to so many bills put before this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the real situation. In 1988, were there prudential arrangements for people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8929"> entering into health care arrangements in hostels? No, not one damn thing was put up by this opposition when they were in government. Was there a cap&mdash;the $98,000 that the member for Jagajaga goes on about? I do not hear her saying too much now because there was no cap under her government. There were no safeguards. Where were their safeguards in 1988? Did they run away? No, they did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go on. Were there safeguards to prevent the sale of the family home to go into a hostel? There were no safeguards, none whatsoever, yet this government has introduced safeguards. Let us get away from the rhetoric and get into the truth, something that you do not mix very well with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about a guarantee for low income earners? People like yourselves are so dedicated to the poor and the low income earners on the wharves and in the mines, those earning $90,000&hyphen;odd plus perhaps, your dedicated workers, your union workers out there who are so necessarily in need of a health care place. What guarantee did you give to genuine low income earners? Absolutely none at all. Yet this government legislates that 25 per cent of places will be made available for those people. You stand condemned for what you did not do in the hostel industry in 1988. The fact is that the policy you introduced put money into the system which allowed for an increase in and an improvement in the standard of living of those people who had to go to hostels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last member to speak for the opposition, the honourable member for Isaacs, almost quoted word for word the requirements to go into a nursing home. Let me tell you the requirements to enter into a hostel in my electorate of Longman, which are no different for any other electorate&mdash;that is, you must be assessed by an aged care assessment team which is organised by a doctor. You do not go into a hostel because you think that it is a great place to be; you go there because you are aged, frail or cannot look after yourself adequately in your own home. For some reason, you seem to think these people go in there for a picnic. It is just not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to paint a picture for you of nursing homes that, unfortunately, I have had 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the displeasure to visit and that, recently, some of my relatives have had the misfortune of also having to visit. I note that the member for Jagajaga has stood up here and proclaimed letters from people she does not want to mention, talking about the situations they were in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the descriptions of some of the nursing homes that are in Brisbane now. I notice the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) was chuckling away there before. Some of these are in his very electorate and he does not intend to do anything about it. Some of them were described as rabbit warrens, as fire traps, as very depressing. Is this the way we wish to see our elderly, frail population live out their dying years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to just paint this picture for you. You go into an old Queensland building, a very old building, a wooden building with dark, narrow hallways. They are cold. They are damp. You go into a small room and there, with the petition of nothing more than a curtain, are two frail old ladies.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You stand up here in your pious fashion and tell us that you care about older Australians. You stand condemned by your own budget papers. The ALP capital funding of nursing homes in 1992-93 was $45 million, and you thought so much of them that, while you borrowed $76 billion to try to get this country somehow looking half decent while you failed us, you spent a miserable $10.7 million in your last year in government&mdash;$10.7 million, not enough to buy one nursing home or one hostel. You should be disgusted with what you have done.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8930">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga parades herself around this country scaring people, and that is an understatement. I went to a retirement village in my electorate some two or three weeks ago. A fellow said to me, `I can't get into a nursing home. They're going to charge me. I'm going to have to sell my house.' I said, `Sir, have you ever applied to go to a nursing home?' `No, but that's what I've heard from the member for Jagajaga.' She wants to stand there and scare the living daylights out of these people, people who have contributed to Australia for so many years and who deserve a fair go. All you can do is scare them into an early grave. The previous member said that we will be nailing down their coffins. You are dancing on their coffins as you attempt to scare them into oblivion. That is the appalling standard of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister has introduced the right legislation into this House to ensure that the measures that come into place today will ensure that my parents and some of us in this place who are unfortunate enough to find ourselves in nursing homes will be cared for in a quality environment. There will be standards. You have just stood up there today and said that nursing homes are going to close because we are going to impose standards&mdash;300 fail the test. Do you people in the gallery want to see your parents, and perhaps yourselves, condemned to living in a dark, damp, cold, unfriendly environment? Is that what you want&mdash;no personal contact in such an environment where the fire hazards are known?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying to you that we want this rectified, and this policy will ensure that it is done. You talk about people making money out of aged care. We are saying there needs to be more quality places, and not one bed will be reduced under this policy. You have three years in which to meet the standard. In that time, those places will be improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the member for Jagajaga has failed the Australian public as an adviser to the previous government. The previous government did not have the political will, did not manage to put any finances in this issue and now stands condemned. So the louder she 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is, the longer she bleats, the more she hopes that she is going to frighten people away from reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just recap the reality of it. In 1988, were there any safeguards by this Labor opposition? No. Were there any standards? No. We have another man who has just arrived in the chamber who has no standards, and he has shown that all week. Did they put any money into it? No. They have not put any money into aged care. They have not put any standards into aged care. They have not put any safeguards there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for Australians having to sell their houses, I ask you this: what did you do to protect those frail people who had to move into hostels? Did you say to them that 25 per cent of places would be made available to the financially disadvantaged? No. Did you say to them that they did not have to sell their houses? No. The answer is no, no, no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have failed. You failed in 1988 to put in the right safeguards, and you are failing today. You will continue to fail the Australian population. They deserve better and they are getting better from a coalition government that has the policies to deliver to the Australian public and to ensure that our families can live in the sort of comfort they deserve and demand in their old age.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill is one of a package implementing the government's decision to move the migration advice industry towards voluntary self-regulation through a period of statutory self-regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures contained in the principal bill are consistent with the government's commitment to reduce unnecessary regulation of small business. At the same time, it maintains and strengthens consumer protection for those people in the community who are vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous or incompetent migration agents. The measures will also contribute to the integrity of the migration program by actively promoting an ethical and competent migration advice industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A review of the existing scheme for registration of migration agents was commissioned by the government in June 1996. This scheme was the first regulatory arrangement to be reviewed by the Commonwealth as a party to the competition principles agreement. The review focused on the impact the scheme has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had on consumer protection and on the costs of regulation borne by business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review was conducted by a task force within my department and was guided by a reference group of independent experts chaired by Mr Ian Spicer, the former Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The reference group also included:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Ms Pamela O'Neil, Chairperson of the Migration Agents Registration Board;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Ian Tonking, a Sydney barrister and consultant editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Trade Practices Reporter</EMPHASIS> ;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Ms Cheryl Webster, a grant-in-aid worker for Careforce, the Anglican Home Mission;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr John Hodges, Queensland State President of the Migration Institute of Australia and a former immigration minister; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Ms Pauline Matthewson, National Committee Member of the Migration Institute of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review found that the existing scheme had achieved a measure of consumer protection. It also found that its credibility had strengthened somewhat in the time since the scheme was reviewed by the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Migration in 1995. The review found that the existing scheme had not adversely affected competition in the migration advice market, although it recognised that there was a need to improve competency standards in a way that would not affect the level of competition in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering the findings of the review, the government concluded that, although it would be possible for the industry to be self-regulating in the future, this was not immediately achievable for two main reasons. The first reason is the vulnerability of the consumer group. This group may have difficulties making an informed choice about the quality of the migration advice they are purchasing. There is a history of exploitation of consumers of migration advice by a number of unscrupulous and unethical migration agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason is the fact that the migration advice industry is not yet `mature', in the sense that there is limited cooperation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8932"> occurring between the three main occupational groups and the Migration Institute of Australia. These occupational groups are lawyers, agents in the private sector of the industry, and agents in the voluntary sector. At present, the Migration Institute of Australia, as an industry association, covers only 10 per cent of registered agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has decided to introduce a form of statutory self-regulation as an interim measure for two years, commencing on 21 March 1998. This bill will provide for the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to appoint the Migration Institute of Australia as the Migration Agents Registration Authority. The Migration Institute of Australia is willing to take on this role and strongly supports the government's intention to maintain a professional and ethical migration advice industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The institute has acknowledged strengths in the areas of competency, education and ethics. However, it will require time and support to develop the infrastructure to undertake the full range of regulatory functions and to achieve coverage of the whole industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation before the House today will provide the necessary statutory backing for this to occur. In addition to the statutory backing provided by the principal bill, I intend to enter into a formal agreement with the Migration Institute of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement will spell out the details of how the institute will carry out its function as the Migration Agents Registration Authority and will include provisions in relation to:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> performance requirements;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> financial accountability;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> complaints handling and discipline processes</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> referral of instances of unregistered practice and fraud to my department for investigation; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> support to be provided by my department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed scheme will be reviewed by the government before 21 March 2000. The review will determine the extent to which the Migration Institute of Australia has developed the capacity and infrastructure to undertake 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the role as industry regulator in a fully self-regulating environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill retains all of the important elements of the existing scheme for registration of migration agents. For example, it will continue to be a mandatory requirement for all persons who wish to practise as migration agents, including members of the legal profession, to be registered. All applicants for registration will be required to satisfy the registration authority that they are of good character and have the necessary knowledge to give quality migration advice and assistance. As is now the case, unregistered practice will be an offence. My department will continue to rigorously investigate and pursue those who provide immigration advice without being registered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with the existing scheme, the bill provides for the investigation of complaints made against migration agents who act in an unprofessional or unscrupulous manner. However, it will also introduce significant improvements in the complaints handling process to address the review's finding that the existing process was expensive, slow and insufficiently responsive to consumer concerns. For example, the bill provides for the registration authority to be able to refer a complainant and the relevant agent to a mediator. The intention is to enable the parties to a dispute to negotiate a mutually acceptable outcome without having to resort to lengthy and expensive disciplinary processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing legislation allows for disciplinary action to be taken against an agent who, for example, is found to have breached the code of conduct or is found not to be a person of integrity. Such disciplinary action can take the form of a caution or the agent's registration can be suspended or cancelled. These sanctions will remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill proposes changes to the way disciplinary action against agents who are also practising lawyers will be handled. The changes will make it possible for the Migration Institute of Australia to refer disciplinary matters involving lawyer agents to the relevant professional bodies for disciplinary action. This will place the responsibility for handling malpractice within the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8933"> legal profession itself, where it properly belongs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also proposes a number of new provisions aimed at strengthening consumer protection and improving the competence of agents. The present definition of `immigration assistance' does not extend to migration advice given in relation to sponsorships or nominations. This means that a person can provide assistance and advice to potential sponsors or nominators without being required to be registered as a migration agent. Both the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and the recent review conducted by my department recommended that this loophole be closed, noting that a growing number of sponsors and nominees were effectively unprotected from poor advice or unscrupulous practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also recognises that travel agents, in advising non-citizen clients of the need to have a visa for travel to and from Australia, could arguably be required to register as migration agents under the existing scheme. This bill amends the definition of `immigration assistance' in a way which will clearly exclude the limited forms of assistance provided by travel agents and interpreters. The bill, therefore, removes an area of unnecessary regulation and uncertainty for the tourism industry. The government wants to ensure that all clients of migration agents are fully protected by the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current arrangements, agents operating in the voluntary sector are not required to meet the same knowledge test for registration as agents operating in the private sector. Some of these agents have fully met the knowledge test and are recognised as highly competent and ethical practitioners. However, many have not. In practice, this has led to the development of two different standards of competency in the industry, with some of the most vulnerable clients receiving a lower standard of service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill addresses this inequity by requiring all agents in the voluntary sector to fully meet the knowledge test in order to qualify for registration as a migration agent. Because many agents in the voluntary sector would be unable to meet the test without further educa 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion and training, the bill provides for a six&hyphen;month period of grace to enable them to qualify. In addition, my department is making funding available for the provision of training courses to enable agents in the voluntary sector to obtain the level of knowledge required for full registration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, agents operating in the voluntary sector and providing their services free of charge are not required to pay a registration fee. The recent review of the existing scheme found that this arrangement resulted in agents in the private sector cross-subsidising agents in the voluntary sector. It also found that fee levels were higher as a result because the cost of processing a registration is the same in all cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two charge bills included in this package reduce this cross-subsidy by ensuring that charges are imposed on voluntary sector agents. The government proposes, however, that the regulations will provide a lower rate of charge for voluntary sector agents in recognition of their lesser capacity to meet the full costs of registration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, once an agent is registered, there are no incentives for them to maintain or improve their knowledge and professional competency. Clients, therefore, have no way of knowing whether an agent has made the effort to keep abreast of changes to the Migration Act and regulations. The bill contains provisions designed to improve the competency and ethical practice of all migration agents. From 21 March 1999, all agents seeking to re&hyphen;register must demonstrate that they have met criteria in relation to undertaking continuing professional development. The details of this requirement will be set out in regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agents who fail to meet this requirement will be refused re&hyphen;registration and will not be permitted to continue to practise in the industry until they reapply and meet the requirements. I am aware that this is a serious measure. It potentially affects the livelihood of some people in small business. But it is necessary both in the public interest and in the interests of consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members would appreciate that the integrity of the government's migration program can be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8934"> compromised by unscrupulous and exploitative practice by migration agents. Currently, consumers have no guarantee that the agent they are paying to give them professional advice is, in fact, fully competent. If this requirement for continuing professional development has the effect of dissuading some agents from remaining in the industry because they do not wish to improve their practice, then the industry and the community would be better off without them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two charge bills are being introduced in tandem with this bill. Together with the provisions in the principal bill, they will provide a more flexible vehicle for setting the level of fees applying to applications for registration. After appointment as the Migration Agents Registration Authority, the Migration Institute of Australia will be authorised to collect fees on behalf of the Commonwealth. The principal bill includes an appropriation to the Migration Institute of Australia to ensure that it recovers the costs of running the new scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Renewal Charge Bill will be repealed on 21 March 1999. After that time, renewal of agents' registration will no longer be automatic. Instead, agents will be required to apply for re-registration and meet the new continuing professional development requirements. The principal bill also includes a series of transitional arrangements. These are designed to enable a seamless transition to the new scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agents who registered under the old scheme will continue to have their registration and renewal dates recognised by the new registration authority. Those who submitted their application for registration close to the expiry of the old scheme will be able to be registered by the new registration authority. In addition, unfinalised complaints and disciplinary processes will be able to be brought to completion by the new registration authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that this package of bills provides a unique opportunity for government and the industry to work together to ensure the development of a competent, reputable and ethical migration advice industry. The government believes this will be of benefit both to consumers and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> broader Australian community. I commend the bill to the House. I present the relevant explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill will insert rules in the income tax law to limit the circumstances in which trusts can deduct current year and prior year losses and debt deductions. The measures generally take effect from 9 May 1995. The government announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget its intention to proceed with the previous government's 1995&hyphen;96 budget announcement on 9 May 1995 that trust loss rules would be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Consultation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has consulted widely with taxpayers and tax professionals in developing the trust loss legislation. The government announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget that several significant changes would be made to the previous government's draft legislation. Those changes were set out in a press release issued on budget night. Most of these changes were made in response to the concerns expressed by taxpayers and tax professionals about the previous government's proposed legislation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In announcing that it would go ahead with the measures, the government committed itself to consulting widely with taxpayers and tax professionals before introducing legislation into the parliament. To this end, the government's draft of the legislation was released for public comment on 10 February 1997. A large number of submissions concerning the exposure draft were received. The government has considered these submissions and has taken them into account in finalising the legislation. The government has made many modifications to the measures in response to concerns raised in the submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the main concerns raised was about the application of the income injection test to family trusts. In response to this concern, the government announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget that it would relax the application of the income injection test for family trusts but the definition of `family member' would be narrowed from the 1997&hyphen;98 budget time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Purpose of the trust loss measures</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the trust loss measures is to restrict the recoupment of losses and other deductions of trusts in order to prevent the transfer of the tax benefit of the losses. This occurs when a person who did not bear the economic effect of the loss when it was incurred by the trust obtains a benefit as a result of the trust's ability to deduct the loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures achieve this aim by examining whether there has been a change in underlying ownership or control of a trust or whether certain schemes have been entered into in order to take advantage of a trust's losses or other deductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax law already contains tests which limit the deductibility of losses incurred by companies. The proposed rules that are to apply to trusts will differ in some respects from those that apply to companies, reflecting the different characteristics of trusts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Changes in ownership or control of a trust</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tests to be satisfied before losses are deductible will vary depending on the type of trust. Each type of trust has to satisfy certain tests relating to ownership or control of the trust in order to be able to deduct prior and current year losses and debt deductions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8936">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, while fixed trusts will be subject to a continuity of ownership test, non&hyphen;family discretionary trusts will be subject to continuity of ownership, continuity of control and pattern of distributions tests. This reflects the fact that it is not possible to apply the same beneficial ownership test to discretionary trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Special rules will also apply to widely held unit trusts so that ownership will be tested generally only where there are abnormal transactions. These rules will help to minimise compliance costs for these types of trusts. Also, a listed widely held unit trust can apply the same business test if it fails the continuity of ownership test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Special tracing rules are provided to overcome difficulties in monitoring ownership of trust interests where certain entities are interposed between the loss trust and the underlying beneficiaries. A special tracing rule applies for family trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These tests do not apply to family trusts, some superannuation funds, deceased estates within a reasonable administration period and unit trusts with unit holders exempt from income tax. These trusts are called excepted trusts in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Income injection schemes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a trust is involved in an income injection scheme to take advantage of deductions, the income injection test may prevent the trust from making full use of the deductions. Under these schemes, income is injected into trusts with losses or other deductions so that no tax is payable on the income. This test applies to all trusts other than excepted trusts. However, the test does apply to family trusts in some circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Family trusts</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Family trusts (as defined) that distribute only to members of the family group will generally not be affected by the proposed measures. The income injection test will generally apply to family trusts only where income is injected from outside the family group. A trust will become a family trust for the purposes of the measures if it makes a family trust election.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A consequence of making the election is that a special tax, called family trust distribution tax, is payable where a family trust gives income or capital to persons who are not members of the family group. This tax will be levied at the top marginal rate applying to individuals, plus Medicare levy. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family trust distribution tax is an anti&hyphen;avoidance measure designed to ensure that the tax benefit of a family trust's losses cannot be transferred to non&hyphen;family members. The government hopes the tax will never need to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Drafting of the legislation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trust loss measures have been drafted so as to fit into the new income tax law being developed as part of the tax law improvement project. The proposed rules are lengthy but necessarily so. For example, there are many different categories of trusts. One way of dealing with trust losses would be to have a few standard rules that apply to all trusts. This would result in the rules themselves being unfair in their impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, different rules have been applied to the different categories of trusts, depending on their nature. The result is that the size of the legislation increases, but this is matched by an increase in the fairness of treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The length of the provisions has also been greatly affected by the changes made by the government in response to representations from taxpayers and tax professionals. This has resulted in a trade&hyphen;off between simplicity and equity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Revenue gain</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The estimated gain to revenue from the proposed changes is $90 million in 1995&hyphen;96, $185 million in 1996&hyphen;97, $160 million in 1997&hyphen;98, $75 million in 1998&hyphen;99, $20 million in 1999&hyphen;2000 and $20 million in 2000&hyphen;2001.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Failure to elect within these strict time limits or to wind up by the prescribed date may result in the members of the fund suffering losses due to the removal of taxation concessions. In addition, given that there are a number of steps involved in making an election, a fund may inadvertently lodge a defective election. In this case, a fund is ineligible for taxation concessions until after they have made a valid election. This is despite the fact that the fund may have complied with the SIS Act and regulations in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all respects apart from lodging a valid election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commissioner previously dealt with the shortcomings in the election process by temporarily modifying the SIS Act under section 333. However, the commissioner's temporary modification power expired on 1 July 1996. This bill amends the SIS Act to permanently reinstate the administrative flexibility which was previously achieved through the temporary modification declarations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, the amendments will confer a discretion on the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to extend the time within which the lodgment of an election must be made with the commissioner and enable trustees to rectify inadvertently invalid elections. The amendments will also address restrictive timing requirements for funds established prior to the SIS regime or funds who were in the process of winding up. By overcoming these technical rigidities, the amendments will enable superannuation funds who would otherwise be deprived of concessional taxation treatment in certain years to obtain access to such treatment, without compromising the security of members' benefits or fund compliance with the retirement income standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is intended that the amendments will take effect retrospectively from 1 July 1996 to ensure that the eligibility for taxation concessions for funds in the period prior to amendment is not jeopardised. I commend the bill to the House and provide the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 9th and 10th reports of the committee for 1997 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Development of operational facilities at RAAF Base Learmonth, WA</EMPHASIS>  and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Redevelopment of facilities for the 51st Battalion: Far North Queensland Regiment throughout Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The first report which I have tabled concerns the proposed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Development of operational facilities at RAAF Base Learmonth, WA</EMPHASIS> . The base is located on North West Cape, WA, 1,235 kilometres north of Perth. The base covers an area of approximately 2,550 hectares, situated on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coastal plain between Cape Range and Exmouth Gulf. The nearest township, Exmouth, is 35 kilometres north of the base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RAAF Base Learmonth is a bare base, which forms part of a chain of defence airfields across northern Australia and is vital to the air defence of north&hyphen;western Australia. The primary function of the base is to serve as a deployment base for combat aircraft in a contingency. The base was developed during the early 1970s and 1980s, and no further development or major maintenance work has occurred since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal examined by the committee involved the construction of:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> explosive ordnance loading aprons for fighter, strike and maritime patrol aircraft&mdash;one apron will double as an explosive ordnance apron for transport aircraft;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> alert facilities for fighter aircraft;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> airfield lighting equipment; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> airfield lighting, engineering services and civil works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The estimated out&hyphen;turn cost of the proposed work was $69 million. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After inspecting the base and conducting a public hearing at Exmouth, at which senior RAAF officers gave evidence, the committee concluded that there is a need for operational facilities at RAAF Base Learmonth to be upgraded to bring them into line with requirements designed to enhance its capabilities for the deployment of fighter, strike and maritime aircraft in a safe and flexible manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal attracted interest from local government authorities who raised a number of issues relating to the use of the main runway for regular public transport aircraft as well as the siting of a number of facilities within the civil aviation area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The downgrading of the runway's pavement classification number by Defence was a matter of concern, and the committee has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8940"> recommended that Defence should enter into further discussions with the Shire of Exmouth about the practicalities of upgrading the pavement classification number of the runway. The project was the subject of an environmental impact assessment, and the report mentions a number of safeguards and precautions to be adopted during and after construction of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second report I tabled covers the proposed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Redevelopment of facilities for the 51st Battalion: Far North Queensland Regiment throughout Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait</EMPHASIS>. By way of background, I should mention that this army unit, with its headquarters in Cairns, is a general reserve regional force surveillance unit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the unit is to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance operations in the Cape York Peninsula, the gulf country and Torres Strait. Elements of the unit are widely dispersed over more than 20 locations throughout its area of operation, which covers 640,000 square kilometres. During any move towards conflict, FNQR would be a vital element of the first three layers of land defence. The unit's observation posts or reconnaissance patrols would be a vital source of initial strategic information which would provide early warning of any changing situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once other military forces are in place, the unit would operate in a zone well forward of any protected vital asset in Far North Queensland to provide a surveillance screen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before addressing the specifics of the proposed work, the committee sought to establish if the unit has an assured future following the restructuring of the army. The committee was advised that this unit, the Pilbara Regiment and Norforce&mdash;all regional force surveillance units&mdash;have an assured future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also sought to establish if the recruitment of reservists can be sustained. Again, Defence advised that a fundamental principle of recruitment is to recruit people from local communities who have specific knowledge and understanding of their areas and use this to support the surveillance capability. The history of the unit has been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> characterised by strong representation of members of local communities. At present, 40 per cent&mdash;200 members&mdash;of the unit are indigenous. It was also pointed out that the unit is currently manned to its full establishment. This is a good indication of the effectiveness of recruitment campaigns and a strong indicator of the support for the unit in Far North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal involves the provision of facilities which will enhance the unit's ability to meet its operational commitments and will involve the redevelopment of some existing facilities and the provision of new facilities. This work will address current deficiencies such as non&hyphen;functionality, size, non&hyphen;compliance with building and occupational health and safety standards and location. The proposal involves work at 22 locations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee concluded that based on the evidence the general lack of modern storage facilities and poor working conditions at headquarters, company headquarters and patrol locations are having an adverse impact on the ability of the unit to undertake assigned tasks. The proposed work encompasses:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> construction of a new facility on the Queerah Meatworks site in Cairns for the Regimental Headquarters, Administration Company, Alpha Company and 134 Regional Cadet Unit;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The estimated out&hyphen;turn cost of the proposed work is $22.5 million. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HV5">Mr WAKELIN</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Grey)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.12 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was making the point earlier that the pastoralists of Grey have been intimidated and provoked by the legal advocates of native title; advocates who are not usually Aboriginal, are usually from Adelaide or Sydney and who have no interest in the productive use of pastoral land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the bitter words of the Democrat senators in the other place, I am proud to include myself amongst the occupation of those people from the land. The pastoralists have been held to ransom. The legislation before us should clarify their position and protect their right to continue to make the soil of this land productive. There is no doubt that the new act and the changes go some way towards that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The miners of Grey have been caught in the inadequacies of the Native Title Act. The larger exploration and development companies have been warned off vast tracts of my electorate and millions of dollars worth of opportunity has disappeared. Perhaps the worst treatment has been meted out to the opal miners of Grey. These men and women and the communities they live in&mdash;places like Andamooka, Coober Pedy, Marla and Mintabie&mdash;have seen their means of earning a living frozen while the native title process creaks through its many stages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The South Australian authorities are unable to register a precious stones claim since the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Wik High Court decision on Lambina pastoral lease. It has generated such frustration that there has been talk of violence and shootings. I do not say these things lightly. They are a reminder of the frustration  and the real dollar and cents cost of native title to people of modest means and the families and communities of my region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spent much of the past 18 months putting forward the demands of the miners to the government. They have been put, I must say, civilly and reasonably, but they are, nevertheless, demands. I believe that with the passage of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  we will see a genuine improvement in the situation in the far north of my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the same stance taken by the Commonwealth on the opal fields of New South Wales has been taken by the Commonwealth on this issue. This legislation should allow for the resolution of that frustration to the benefit of those people in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to the state of Aboriginal Australia. It would be absolutely wrong to suggest the reforms at hand are in some way a zero sum gain trade&hyphen;off between Aborigines and other Australians as if improving the lot of farmers and miners is only made possible by the disadvantage of Aborigines. After all, more than one in 20 of my constituents is Aboriginal, compared with the electorate of the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I understand only one in 250 of his constituents is Aboriginal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was able to visit the communities of Oak Valley, Ceduna and the Buttlingarra community at Whyalla not two weeks ago, in the company of the admirable senator the Hon. John Herron, Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Those constituents of mine do not want the feelgood romanticism of native title as it is represented by the ALP: they want running water, reasonable health, English literacy and employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More and more, many Aboriginal people are beginning to understand the folly of welfare. They want opportunities, not handouts&mdash;an option that was clearly denied to far too many of them under the hypocritical Labor Party and an option that is attainable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8942"> and is being attained under this government. As the ALP should know, mining royalty payments to Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory alone have totalled $350 million in the past 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP subscribes to far too many myths about this country's past. I am reminded that three years ago I had to strongly differ with the claim of the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) during the debate on the land fund bill that the Aborigines of Central Australia were only there because they had been pushed off better land in Australia. As I told the member for Charlton at the time, the land he talked so derisively of is top cattle country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might think it would only be Pitjantjatjara country. People have lived on that land for many thousands of years and they do not appreciate being told that their home and their land is a wasteland and of inferior quality to any other land in the country. It is ironic that the inalienable freehold title of the Pitjantjatjara land offers, under its current administration, less land access for Aboriginal people in the way that they would like to have access than the previous pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to reconciliation. The myths of the concept of reconciliation abound in this debate&mdash;one might even describe it as a mantra for the opposition benches. I believe that the central tenet of reconciliation&mdash;the idea that there is a gaping hole in the spiritual life of this nation that can be remedied only by prolonged apologising by white Australia&mdash;is not only an insult to this nation and its people but a dead-end for Aboriginal people. It is a road to nowhere and its pursuit is undoubtedly to the disadvantage of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until we recognise that history is just that&mdash;history&mdash;and until we ask all Australians to take responsibility for the here and now, we can never be one people and our nation will still be divided, one Australian against another, to the detriment of ourselves and our nation. In fact, over the years that I have been in this place I have sadly come to the conclusion that the ALP has a vested interest in continuing division in a rather self&hyphen;righteous way. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move to the alliance against reform. Perhaps the most intriguing part of this ongoing debate is the distinct difference between the submissions of those who maintain that the Native Title Act is serving this nation well and those who recognise its inadequacies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, those who oppose the government's reforms provide no alternative solutions to the problems we confront. Let us remind ourselves: we have had over 600 claims, one of which was successful&mdash;that is, if you want to call the exchange of money for some building blocks a success. That is the situation with native title in Australia: $88.8 million spent and in effect I would say no successful native title claims in mainland Australia. If that is success, please let us think again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the submissions of the opposed tend to be glossy, lavish and come from individual groups from Sydney and Melbourne almost exclusively&mdash;certainly from metropolitan Australia. To be frank, I have had a gutful of the self-righteous academics and the many Christian church leaders telling me&mdash;and by implication the people I represent&mdash;what is going on in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have sent a standard response to such correspondence asking that they come out to my part of the world and actually see the reality of Aborigines and rural people that is threatened by the present Native Title Act. I have asked them to come and speak with Aborigines, farmers and miners. I have not had a single response to my invitation. There is none so blind as he who refuses to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To balance that, I must add the encouragement that I felt when I read an account by Bishop Malcolm, an Aboriginal bishop, who made the comment that if we must go down the track of reliving our history&mdash;however coloured that may be in all its descriptions&mdash;Aboriginal people will need to acknowledge the acts of violence against the white people as much as the white people will need to acknowledge the acts of violence against Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the ALP's position, I have already touched on the negligent role played by the ALP and those of the party who once sought 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8943"> to speak on behalf of regional and rural communities. There is no voice for the regions in the ALP caucus in this parliament, and that lack of voice is reflected in the ALP stance on these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the member for Banks has been allowed to run his ideological agenda at the expense of the people of the regions is a disgrace. Those who have not stood up to him and sought a different, less biased viewpoint should hang their heads in shame. Those metropolitan Australians who are such vociferous opponents of this bill and yet hide behind the reality that the land they own and occupy is immune from any aspect of native title or the Native Title Act are nothing but hypocrites, and their opinions should be viewed as such.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the legislation at hand. I spent the past 18 months working closely with the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) and others in coordination with Senator Minchin. I would be lying if I said that those negotiations were at all times amicable and I would be dishonest if I said that I did not have some continuing concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those concerns include the priority given by this legislation to representative bodies in the right to negotiate process. I still have doubt about the capabilities of those bodies in such a process&mdash;doubts that I am sure are shared by the member for the Northern Territory, who knows better than most the adversarial approach often taken by these bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, the Aboriginal legal rights movement holds considerable sway. Its correspondence with miners in the region is notorious, as are its draft budgets which it bills miners for before exploration licences are granted. In order to clear a tenement area, it is expected that an applicant will provide for two anthropologists, one male and one female, at $600 a day; eight traditional owners at $250 a day; an interpreter at $350 a day; a vehicle at $125 a day; fuel costs; hire of GPS equipment at $320 a week; food at $40 per person a day; travel costs; and accommodation plus a 15 per cent administration fee.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is simply amazing, especially for a body that has received almost $5 million in taxpayer funding over the past five years. If that is the sort of attitude struck by such a powerful representative body, then I must doubt the capacity of such bodies to manage the right to negotiate process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are obviously significant problems with the Native Title Act as it stands. This bill will go a good way towards remedying those problems. Many of the uninformed may criticise my stance as somehow racist or naive. While it may be naive to believe that we should not divide Australia on the basis of the colour of people's skin, surely there can be no other acceptable moral choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I would like to speak of an incident I encountered before I was a member of this House. I was out in the Pitjantjatjara land with the now Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) whose interest in Aboriginal affairs is longstanding. As a lowly candidate at the time, I was quietly listening along with many of the elders of Ernabella or Pukatja.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On my way back to the airfield, I travelled with one of the elders. After 15 or 20 minutes of silence, he quietly asked me, `Are you related to them Wakelins at Port Adelaide?' I told him I was, that my son was at the football club and that my nephews were also footballers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In no time at all we were deep in conversation on the merits of Port Adelaide. He told me of a recent match played in Alice Springs that many of the people of Ernabella had gone to see. A centralian team was playing the Port Adelaide football team. The Ernabella people were barracking with the best, not for the almost wholly Aboriginal centralian team, but for Port Adelaide. Why? Because they shared the Ernabella football club's colours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was no racial divide, no bitter history, no talk of hate or despair. There were just people sharing in a common love of football. That kind of attitude must characterise our future direction for the benefit of all Australians and that attitude is reflected in the provisions of this just bill. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contribution from the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) to the debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  saddens me, and I will say a little about why in just a moment. We are coming in this discussion of the Wik legislation to what, hopefully, will be the culmination of what has been in modern times a 30-year attempt to grant to Australia's Aboriginal people the dignity of ownership of the land and the right to negotiate that goes with that land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mabo decision of the High Court, subsequently further clarified by the Wik decision of the High Court, has made it very clear that there is only one way that this final stage can go. I think that was eminently well summed up by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in his contribution in this debate the other day when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government must come to understand that native title rights are a reality and that they are here to stay. They have been recognised by the High Court as fundamental legal property rights and are entitled to the same respect and protection as the property rights of non-indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is at the heart of the debate over this bill and that is why Labor wants to make substantial changes to the bill. We believe that this bill contains several measures which are a last-ditch attempt, either by subterfuge or quite openly, to extinguish native title as it has been decreed by the High Court. That being the case, we cannot accept it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Grey and others before him have said that the government and the nation should be focusing their efforts on eradicating the dreadful inequality in the treatment of Aboriginal people in Australia, particularly those living outside mainstream areas, and of non-indigenous people in relation to schools, health facilities, roads, transport and all the other things that go with our life and government investment in our life. I agree with that, but the point that I make is that we need to move on from this point about the ownership of the land and the right to negotiate. Back when the Hawke government was first elected it was called the power of veto and back when Whitlam tried to tackle it it was simply called land rights.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principles of the decision of the High Court have been opposed by the coalition at every step since Gough Whitlam tried to give it effect in 1972. Even now when the High Court has given up on the politicians and has responded in two decisions clarifying that there is a land right and that, provided certain conditions are met, that land right stands, we have this last&hyphen;ditch attempt to extinguish native title as it has been granted by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I relate two or three instances in my experience as the member for Burke which have fortified my opinions and judgments on this issue. In 1986, not long after I was elected to parliament, I travelled as part of a delegation to Kakadu and witnessed the start of what was supposed to be a grand new era: the approval of the uranium mine and the package of dollar compensation that went with it. Everybody at the time believed that that money would produce opportunities in one form or other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went back to Kakadu last year, 10 years after the event, to look at other issues related to the expansion of mining. I found that, $20 million down the road, alcoholism and Aboriginal illiteracy were worse. We did not even have an Aboriginal school teacher for grade 6 kids, for heaven's sake! We did not have a hostel where kids coming in from outlying districts, sometimes travelling for anything up to two hours across the bush to school, could stay in the town. It became very clear to me that this is not about money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to commend, in particular, the Australian mining industry. For the first year or so of our time in opposition I had the portfolio of resources and energy and I had a lot to do with the mining companies, including quite active participation in the negotiation of the solution at Century Zinc in Queensland. The Australian mining industry has impressed me; they too know that this is not about dollars. They know it is about negotiating: negotiating jobs, negotiating a role, negotiating dignity in partnership with the mining ventures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen a lot of examples of this falling into place. I observe, for instance, the recent publication from the Australian Bureau 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8945"> of Statistics for the June quarter 1997 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Actual and Expected Private Mineral Exploration</EMPHASIS>. It starts off by saying that the upward trend in exploration expenditure since the June quarter 1993 continued in the June quarter 1997. Here is physical evidence from the ABS that all these claims that native title is scaring away miners are just that&mdash;junk claims. The evidence from ABS is that it has been a consistent upward trend from the day the act came in. I think it ought to be exposed for that. What is at the heart of this is that 30&hyphen;year resistance to the concept of ownership of the land for these people. That was the first experience that I wanted to relate to you&mdash;the visit to Kakadu. The other was much closer to my home base at Kyneton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the bicentennial year of 1988 the then Shire of Metcalfe, a small rural council, which was amalgamated but does not exist any more, as its contribution to the bicentennial year commissioned a woman&mdash;I apologise to the House, I forget her name&mdash;to do a history of the Metcalfe Shire. This area is about 100 kilometres north of Melbourne. It is just south of Bendigo for those who wonder where it might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That history, when it was tabled and presented, shocked me. I had expected the normal thing you get in a shire history: these are the people who settled here first; this is who became the mayor; this is how the mayor's family have carried on right down through the last 100 years&mdash;all the wonderful stuff that we have with a history that starts in 1850. But this woman went right back and she gave a deploringly vivid account of the systematic poisoning, hunting and driving out of the Aboriginal community that existed in quite large numbers in central Victoria prior to the 1840s. I read that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of weeks later I was at one of the annual art displays held in the Macedon Ranges, which is in my electorate. It is quite a large annual display and gets a very big turnout. With this in my mind, I was giving an opening speech. I had looked at all the exhibits and I noticed not one painting or photograph that in any way tried to depict anything prior to 1850. In the following year, I was very pleased to see that a couple of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> artists had had a go at trying to represent what might have been happening in our area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Near Lancefield we have a hole in the ground&mdash;a quarry that was used by our indigenous people, about 30,000 years ago it is estimated, for quarrying and making implements for cooking and hunting. That stone has been found in Indonesia and has been traded in other places in the world. We have no idea how it got there, but we know that this is one of three quarries in the world that have this history and it is obviously very significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess what I am saying is that it came as a shock to me to be confronted with the reality of what had happened, and we have to recognise this. We have to amend this legislation and once and for all recognise what the High Court has said. The High Court is right. Of course it is right. We should recognise what is right, put it in place, close down the issue and move on and do the things we all should be doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will pick up on a comment the member for Grey made before when he deplored the fact that regional MPs within the Labor caucus were not expressing a different view from the view of the member for Banks (Mr Melham), Labor's spokesman on Aboriginal affairs, and we were not straightening him out. Let me say, as one of Labor's regional members&mdash;and there are not many of us left, I admit, after the last election; there are only two or three of us who actually survived, but I am one of them&mdash;</PARA>

I have found that I can get up at a Rotary club or RSL club anywhere in regional Australia and explain Mabo, explain Wik, explain land rights and get not only what I call a positive response but also what we know in this place as a ripper response, because it is the first time these people have heard the other side of

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As shadow minister for primary industries, I want to say a couple of things in the time left available to me about farming, this whole process in this House and my attitude to the bill as it relates to the comments of the National Farmers Federation. One of the things that has absolutely disappointed me in this last 12 months is that John Howard, the Prime Minister, made the big statement in April, `I will have this bill in the House before Easter.' Do you all remember that? `We are going to get this through quickly. We are going to get it off the table.' Six months later it has finally arrived and it has been juiced up for another purpose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several ministers later, too. It has been juiced up for another purpose. It is going to be used as an election platform: Labor versus the coalition; Labor is trying to close down country Australia; Labor is trying to give these Aboriginal people these land rights. That is what is going on here now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went to the Prime Minister in November last year, and we made the point that Gareth Evans&mdash;I hope he is not listening to this&mdash;who I would say is probably the smartest legal brain in this House by a long way, and Daryl Melham, a former public defender in New South Wales who knows his law, have gone right through this whole Native Title Act 1993, and they know exactly what the High Court meant. They know exactly what the provisions mean. That was on offer to John Howard. The offer was made by Labor. We are prepared to sit down and take you through the intricacies and produce a bill for the parliament that will amend the Native Title Act and provide all the players with the certainty they are looking for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister was not interested. So don't anybody talk about bipartisanship on the part of Labor. The offer was made and he was not interested, because he knew that any decent bipartisan settlement would not satisfy the National Party. He is absolutely right 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about that. So we were never in a position where we could get legislation through on Wik that satisfied the National Party and met the needs of the two major parties. I will challenge John Howard right now to defy or deny a single word that I have just said. Mr Beazley put that offer on the table. It could have all been over and done with by now. He could have actually met his objective of having this bill in here last Easter, but that is not the way it has gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the areas relating to pastoral leases, let me say again that I agree&mdash;I think Kim Beazley summarised our position very well&mdash;with what he had to say in his opening response to the Prime Minister's tabling document. It is true, in our view, that the measures which moved towards redefining what is meant by a `lease' and redefining what is meant by `farming activities' represent a massive overreach of what was defined by the leases when they were issued by the state governments and what is meant by a `grazing lease'. To expand that definition so that it covers a whole lot of things that were not intended when the lease was issued is, in fact, a granting of a new lease which expands the nature of the title and therefore extinguishes the rights of the Aboriginal people who would otherwise qualify. I keep making that point. That is an overreach we cannot support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To use the tax act definition of farming for what essentially is a grazing lease, again, is a massive overreach and it does represent a clear curtailment of the common law rights of indigenous people. All it will do is finish up in the High Court. What is the point of our bringing a bill through this House, even if Labor went along with it, knowing very well that it would not stand up before the High Court and that we would be right back into that 10&hyphen;year process of uncertainty? That is why we are moving our amendments. We understand what will stack up. I go back to that fundamental statement that Mr Beazley made:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government must come to understand that native title rights are a reality and that they are here to stay. They have been recognised by the High Court as fundamental legal property rights and are entitled to the same respect and protection 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8947"> as the property rights of non&hyphen;indigenous Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to have an opportunity to speak on this very important legislation, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill</XREF> , which the government has introduced in order that it may deliver on a commitment it made to the Australian people, both indigenous and non-indigenous, during the election and, of course, that it may also deal with some very important problems that have to be resolved following the unsatisfactory legislation introduced by the Keating government in 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation that the government has introduced has a number of important objectives. First of all, it will reduce uncertainty. I was interested to hear the speech of the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), which I regret was a grave misrepresentation of this bill. It was an opportunist speech designed to cause people concern and to inflame those in the community who do not have a full knowledge of all the details. The facts will catch up with the member as the debate ensues. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is great uncertainty, and this legislation is designed to address that. It is also designed to improve the workability of the native title process and to find a balance in the interests 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of all the parties. I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and Senator Minchin, his parliamentary secretary, members of the government committee and others who have worked very hard to bring all the parties together in this very complex issue in order to find a balance in the interests of all the parties&mdash;something that will benefit Australia in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to what the member for Burke was quite wrongly representing, this legislation is designed to maintain respect under the law for native title as determined by the High Court. If we study the words of the member for Burke in his contribution just a few moments ago, the conclusion would have to be made, if we were not aware of what the bill intends to do, that it was going to take away the native title rights and abolish the Mabo common law judgment. That is absolutely untrue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say from the outset that the government has reiterated and confirms in this legislation, if you study it closely, that it is committed to respecting the native title rights of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, as this parliament should. That is an absolute commitment and this legislation is designed to deliver that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government takes the view that the common law judgment of the High Court in Mabo, delivered some five years ago now, was a very important day for indigenous Australians and was recognition at last of the struggle of Eddie Mabo's family to have recognition of their common law rights in respect of the Mabo lands. The coalition government does not in any shape or form intend to be associated with the words of the member for Burke or to allow him to get away with the misrepresentation that this legislation is designed to destroy that judgment. It is quite the reverse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to record that I have a special interest in this issue not only as a member of the parliament but also as the Chair of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I am very proud to be the chair and to try to advance the interests of indigenous people and also to help bring about a better understanding of this great 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8948"> country between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to mention that my family does have a very small number of shares in mining companies in Australia. I have disclosed those, of course, under the requirements of members' interests. I felt that I should mention that I have them because, obviously, part of this debate involves the activities of exploration and mining in Australia. Whilst my shares are very minute, nevertheless I felt it was my duty to just mention that I have that interest because mining and exploration are part of Australia's economic activity and are very important to its future. I am very concerned to ensure that Australia does have a vibrant, modern mining industry to go into the next millennium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to mention that I have seen the operation of the Keating Native Title Act 1993 in my own electorate of Indi. Members would know of the claim that is referred to throughout Australia now as the Yorta Yorta claim. It covers a substantial part of my electorate in north-east Victoria&mdash;not only a large mass of land in north-east Victoria but also the rivers and streams, and one of them is the great river, the Murray River. So you can imagine how much interest has been engendered in the constituency I represent and in my own mind about the workings of the Keating Native Title Act and how it has impacted on the lives and the communities of the indigenous people in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on the Yorta Yorta's view of what the Mabo decision means, the processes of the Federal Court, the Native Title Tribunal and the registrars that were set out in the 1993 Keating legislation&mdash;which this bill amends&mdash;have defied, if you like, the best efforts of everybody to bring everybody together. The conciliation and consultative process failed. I think it is fair for me to say that the judge presiding in those areas finished up saying that it was absolutely impossible to bring the parties together because of the uncertainties of the legislation and the competing claims. As a result of that, regretfully, that case is now before the Federal Court and there are various estimates on the duration of that case, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but it is estimated in some legal quarters that it will take five years to determine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So for members of the opposition who spawned the 1993 legislation&mdash;and we had the member for Burke representing them a moment ago&mdash;to tell this House and the community that the native title legislation they brought in is good legislation and is working well in the interests of all indigenous people is quite absurd. I just wish the truth would come out and people would come down and analyse the Yorta Yorta issue to see how it is operating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are hundreds of claims now across Australia. More than 70 per cent of Australia's land mass is subject to a potential claim. Sadly for the indigenous people, I think only one claim has been settled in the five years the Keating legislation has been in operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As chair of the committee and as an Australian, I express my alarm at the damage that that inadequate, unsatisfactory legislation is causing our Australian indigenous people. It has heightened their expectation in some quarters. It has led to these massive, frightening legal sagas. These cases are just rolling on and on and on for years and years at huge cost. Regretfully, in some areas of our community, this has caused division between Australians&mdash;indigenous and non-indigenous&mdash;because some people, rightly or wrongly, have felt threatened by applications for native title, and the Yorta Yorta claim is no exception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People from various backgrounds and communities have felt antagonism, and some disrespect has been developing between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians as a result of the way in which the 1993 Labor Party legislation has failed Australians. It has let them down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel very strongly about that because, let us face it, it is hard enough for indigenous people. They face great disadvantages in our country, and all of us care very much about how we can resolve their problems, help them and bring all Australians together. It is our duty&mdash;as legislators who are honoured to be in the parliament now and who will be honoured to come here in the future&mdash;to do that. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8949"> It really makes me angry to think that the disadvantages and difficulties of our indigenous people have been heightened by the failure of the Keating legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For any member of the Labor Party to stand up and belittle the Prime Minister's efforts to resolve those difficulties, to put obstacles in his way and to misrepresent his work is shameful. I believe that what they are doing is capitalising on the political heat that has generated from such irresponsible statements, and it is not in the interests of indigenous people, non-indigenous people or Australia for them to get away with it. This legislation is an opportunity for people to be non-party political and to work together to resolve the mess that the Labor Party created in bringing in legislation which it said would do certain things but has not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in his own preamble to the 1993 legislation, declared that pastoral leases would extinguish common law native title. As a result, many people accepted that, came together and agreed to compromise. In some sense, they supported the 1993 legislation. As it has transpired, that statement about the question of extinguishment by pastoral lease is under a legal cloud and it needs to be addressed to give certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No caring Australian could argue against that principle. It needs to be addressed openly, transparently and in a positive way to remove uncertainty. What do we find? We find the opposition&mdash;responsible for the legal problem and the mess that they have put on the shoulders of indigenous and non-indigenous Australians&mdash;trying to capitalise as politicians by continuing to divide and confuse. I think that is shameful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The next point I want to make is that, if you study the systems of land tenure in Australia since white settlement, you will see that there has always been a need for people in the public interest to compromise so that when you have legislation like this, which attempts to settle the differences between competing interests and parties, you should balance it against the historical performance of land tenure systems in Australia. When the freehold systems were developed&mdash;first of all, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the common law&hyphen;general law titles of Australia and then followed by the Torrens system of title giving indefeatable titles&mdash;there were always qualifications about the rights of the Crown. It was always stated that the Crown would be paramount in certain respects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After Federation, the Australian constitution provided that the taking of people's property by the Commonwealth had to be accompanied by adequate compensation and could not be taken unless there was adequate compensation. But the right to take property has been set out quite clearly in the constitution since Federation. All the states also have power to take property from property owners. In some cases, the states do not have to pay adequate compensation, although most of the state parliaments have passed legislation acknowledging that adequate compensation should be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But take water, for example, which is one of the issues involved in the Yorta Yorta claim. The rights of Australian freeholders to water have been severely curtailed by the parliaments. It is important that water be managed properly in the public interest because it is a finite resource. In fact, in Victoria, my state, 50 per cent of our water resource is already consumed by the existing residents, and commercial and farming activities in that state. So it is a very precious commodity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Years ago, Alfred Deakin in Victoria was the pioneer of water legislation which eventually led to the Victorian parliament actually confiscating&mdash;might I say without compensation at all&mdash;the water rights of freehold people in Australia. Ground water, underwater water reserves, and water in water courses, rivers, creeks and the like now belong to the Crown. Previously, some title owners would have had some claim to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly with minerals: the history of land tenure systems in Australia has acknowledged that it is in the public interest that the elected parliaments, state and federal, have control over those mineral resources that are below the surface in this country. So it is that freehold owners of land in this country do not have the right to prevent exploration or to stop mining. They have certain inputs into the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8950"> process  which are set out in state acts of parliament dealing with access, compensation, disturbance of soil and perhaps royalties in some cases. But the minerals are owned by the Crown, not by the individual freeholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make these comments simply to put in context the Labor Party attack on this legislation, which is designed to do things that are absolutely urgent and which does not take away the common law rights of indigenous people as set out in the High Court judgment. Nevertheless, the indigenous people should be judged in the light of the fact that all other property owners in Australia since white settlement have had to give up some of their rights&mdash;under their freehold rights or otherwise&mdash;because public policy has determined it appropriate that the management of resources be vested in the Crown in certain ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel it is important to point that out because it does diminish the worth of the contributions made by Labor Party members who are trying to argue that this legislation does awful things. It does not at all. It reduces uncertainty, which has to be done because we cannot go on the way we are due to the failure of the 1993 legislation of the Labor government. It improves the workability of the process of determining whether native title exists or not. And that has to be done to help bring people together, to stop confrontation. It finds a balance, using wisdom, insight and judgment&mdash;but a correct judgment&mdash;amongst the interests of all of the parties designed to bring them together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, and most importantly, it maintains respect for native title as determined by the High Court in the Mabo decision. It does not extinguish those rights. Furthermore, at the end of the period under the legislation when the statutory framework for dealing with these claims expires, it preserves the common law rights of people to make claims for native title under the judgment of the Mabo decision of the High Court. That has to be recognised as being a very responsible approach being taken by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would also like to mention&mdash;for those people who are attempting to show that indigenous people are being stripped of their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rights&mdash;that the Aboriginal people in Australia have already been provided through a system of freehold, leasehold or crown land with some 15.3 per cent of the land surface of Australia. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people represent some two per cent of Australia's total population. They have already a 15.3 per cent&mdash;</PARA>

He might like to extrapolate that and tell us what inference he was drawing in that contribution. But, sadly, time ran out for him. Unfortunately, time for members of the opposition in this debate is going to be even more curtailed. Because there are so many members of the opposition who want to speak on this legislation, we have been asked to cut our contributions roughly in half. I will endeavour to cover the key issues of concern in the time available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill, the High Court decision on Wik, the High Court decision on Mabo and the earlier native title legislation has not been conducted in some policy vacuum, social vacuum or social equity vacuum. It has not been con 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8951"> ducted in terms of the legalese of land ownership; it has been conducted against a background of social inequality and prejudice that is unparalleled in the history of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be foolish to address this issue without acknowledging some of those events. There has been a systematic discrimination against Aboriginal and Islander people for the last 200 years which cannot be compared to the problems beset by any other group in this community. Yes, there are many groups in the community, and individuals particularly, who have a disadvantage from one perspective or another, but there is no other group which has been systematically discriminated against by the state over many years. This is not a political point; it happens to have been a fact of life for all political persuasions over the course of democratic governments in this century and, prior to that, colonial government. There has been systematic discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The horrific thing is how recent that systematic discrimination has continued. In the state of Queensland, for example, it has only been in the last 20 to 24 years that Aboriginal and Islander people have been allowed to work for a wage and keep it. Until the mid-1970s, Aboriginal and Islander people who worked side by side with anyone else in a full award paying job were not allowed to get an award wage. The state government, through legislation, took the money from them and put it into an account&mdash;not their account; a state Treasury run account. To this day, the millions of dollars that were taken from those people have never been returned to them&mdash;some are still alive&mdash;or their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That systematic deprivation of economic liberty was not imposed upon any other individuals in our society at any time. But, in the state of Queensland, Aboriginal and Islander people were denied the opportunity to ever get any economic independence in our society. It is a matter of some shame that successive Queensland governments have been unable to properly address the question of the wages that were stolen by law, but nonetheless stolen, from those people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No other group has been systematically rounded up and located in reserves. In a former life when I was an official in the Queensland Teachers Union, I had the opportunity to visit the schools and to see the conditions of life of people living in the Gulf, around the Cape and on the islands. The conditions which those people were forced to live in were a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was even more of a disgrace was the way the state government at that time&mdash;in about 1981 and 1982&mdash;took some glee out of the hardship that those people suffered. I can remember standing on the jetty on Thursday Island watching the supply boat that was owned by the state government, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Melbidir</EMPHASIS>, come into port on Thursday Island while they ferried the young girls&mdash;only the young girls&mdash;from the island out to the boat to be entertainment for the public servants on that ship. I stood there on that jetty and watched in absolute disbelief. This is not South Africa. This is not the United States 200 years ago. This is Queensland not even 20 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No group in our community has been so systematically stripped of their dignity or systematically murdered, as has been the case with Aboriginals and Islanders. I am advised that the last time someone was shot with no charges being laid against the person who fired the gun that killed the person who was doing no harm&mdash;if we exclude things such as deaths in custody&mdash;was in the early 1950s in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No other group in our community has had their children stolen from them. Every member of this House has read, or at least had the opportunity to read, the excellent report on the stolen generation. No group in our society has suffered the systematic attack on the very fabric of their life&mdash;their family, their loved ones and the people closest to them&mdash;other than the Aboriginal and Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shame of it is that it was done by authority of the state. That is the background in which this debate has occurred. It is patent nonsense for people like the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) to stand here and tell us that we should treat everyone the same, to draw a line in the sand and pretend that yesterday we were all equal and therefore 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8952"> everyone should be treated equally tomorrow. It is peddled either by people who are ignorant or by people who are racist. It seems to me that they are the only two options you have in analysing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now quickly turn to some of the provisions that are before us, having made some comments about the background. There has been a lot of debate in the community and some in this House about the rights of people with land ownership and how the wishes of Aboriginal and Islander people in respect of the Wik High Court decision will somehow affect people's ownership rights. I have spoken to a lot of people in my electorate and around Brisbane about this. There is a great deal of surprise when you tell people that the pastoralists we are talking about do not actually own the land. They have never bought it. They do not own it today. They have never owned it at any time in their life. Their parents did not own it. No-one has owned it. It has been leased; it has been rented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a perception in the community, which some in this debate are happy to continue to foster, that these people are pastoralists&mdash;but they may be third, fourth or fifth generation pastoralists&mdash;and that that land is theirs because they have paid for it, they have bought it and they have a freehold in the same way that people in my electorate in Brisbane know and feel they own the house that they bought and are living in. That is not the case, but the view that the indigenous people have set out in relation to freehold land should be noted for the record. I am referring to a document put out in June this year by ATSIC on issues for indigenous peoples. In this document they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is accepted that private freehold grants and residential leases extinguish native title . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is plain enough. The Aboriginal and Islander people are not contesting that. It is about time a bit of honesty entered this debate and people understood that we are not talking about freehold. In this particular area, we are talking about pastoral leases and leasehold land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have the indigenous groups said about that? The document that was prepared in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relation to the Wik decision earlier this year says this about pastoral leases:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is a need to clarify the ability of pastoralists to carry out development activities under their leases, the NIWG policy position is that it is prepared to support appropriate legislative confirmation of the existing legal rights of pastoralists under their leases.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The NIWG is the National Indigenous Working Group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is wrong with that? They are saying that they are quite happy to legislate and put into the law an acknowledgment that the rights people have under their leases will be enshrined in the statutes. That seems to me to be quite reasonable. But the problem with it is that a lot of those people who have got leases have done things beyond the rights of their lease. Pastoralists have gone beyond their legal rights. They have rented the property&mdash;in very many cases for not much payment&mdash;and, having done that for many years and enjoyed the land as if it was theirs in freehold, they now want you to believe they should have the rights of freehold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have been caught out by the Wik decision. Their past practices of exceeding their rights as tenants&mdash;their past practice of doing more than their lease allows them to do&mdash;have now been brought into question. The High Court has said and the Aboriginal and Islander community have said that they are happy to support a view wherein those rights extinguish native title rights to the extent of any inconsistency, but that does not mean that Aboriginal and Islander people have no rights at all on that land, because leasehold rights are not the same as freehold. They do not afford unfettered opportunity to do what you like with the property. It is a lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are people who are leaseholders who want to turn their lease rights into ownership rights and they want to do that at the expense of Aboriginal and Islander people. They want to do it at the expense of common law rights that those Aboriginal and Islander people have as determined by the High Court. That is fundamentally wrong.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me go to the comments of your Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer): `Bucket loads of extinguishment in the 10&hyphen;point plan.' They were the Deputy Prime Minister's words. That is what your own Deputy Prime Minister describes this as being. People who have freehold land are entitled to the rights of freehold land. People who have leasehold land are entitled to a different set of rights. The Wik decision made it plain that, where the two rights clash, the pastoralist lease rights prevail, and the Aboriginal and Islander community have accepted that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not good enough for the conservatives in this parliament. That is not good enough for people like the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman). The member for Indi wants to strip these people of those rights. He wants to say to someone who is a leaseholder, `We will give you the same sorts of rights as if you owned it.' In fact, they are going one better because, if you happen to be lucky enough to have a lease which is next to vacant crown land, this legislation is actually going to say that you can extend into that vacant crown land. Aboriginal and Islander claims over vacant crown land that is adjacent to the lease are going to be wiped out. Under this arrangement, the leaseholders are being given more power than if they owned the land. They are actually now going to have a claim over adjacent vacant land by wiping out the rights of indigenous people over that vacant crown land. That is a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have used up the time that I was asked to restrict myself to, but there are a couple of points I want to make very quickly. The exposure in the last few days of the Law Reform Commission's views on this legislation should ring alarm bells in the minds of everyone in the government, even if they do not like what the High Court has said. Even if they want to extinguish the Aboriginal and Islander title, they should understand the folly of what they are embarking on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be one winner out of this legislation going through the parliament and that will be the lawyers. This is their bonanza. Do not worry about the year 2000 fund; the year 2000 fund will pale into insignificance. Over 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the course of the next few years, this will be the lawyers' bonanza and the government will have created it because they will not heed the advice of people who have been involved in negotiations on this for some years, nor will they heed the advice of people such as the Law Reform Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quickly want to mention the tax act definition of primary production that has been thrown in here. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know why the government has decided to define primary industries broadly under the tax act definition? It is precisely because of what I said before: the government knows that there are a lot of pastoralists out there who have breached their leases and have done things that they were not entitled to do. So to cover that, they are going to introduce a new definition. They are now going to legislate to enable those pastoralists to do whatever it is the tax act says is primary industry, even if they never had the right to do that in the past under their lease. And that is fair play&mdash;fair play against a group of indigenous people who have got a High Court decision that says otherwise!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two final things that I will quickly say. I listened to a comment earlier in the debate from one of the government members about how mining has been devastated as a result of the High Court decision and our earlier native title. Yesterday, the ABS figures for actual and expected private mineral exploration came out. Members on the other side were making an argument that suited their political purpose; these are the facts. I am quoting from the document released just yesterday. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The upward trend in exploration expenditure since the June quarter 1993 continued to the June quarter 1997.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, in precisely the four&hyphen;year period in which members of the government say that investors have been running away from us and that the mining industry is being destroyed, the ABS tells us that mining exploration has gone up again in the last quarter as it has right through from June 1993. So no more of the scare tactics about how we are frightening away investment. We are not. The legislation you are putting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8954"> through, the uncertainty it will create, and the field day it will provide for solicitors are what will provide the uncertainty. If there is a downturn in that figure next year, it will not be as a result of our legislation or the High Court's decision; it will be as a result of your own uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very last thing I want to say is to quote a source I do not usually use, the editorial of the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>. Today the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>, in a very timely intervention in this debate, had an editorial in which they referred to a number of things, including the comments made by the Law Reform Commission. The editorial said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an important and independent group of expert lawyers considers that the legislation to implement the Prime Minister's 10&hyphen;point plan is constitutionally suspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parliamentary committee and Parliament may pretend that advice does not exist. Everyone else will know, however, that the Government's proposals, if adopted, will be challenged in the High Court. The one thing that we can be sure of is that it will take years to determine whether any new law is valid. The 10&hyphen;point plan will not produce the certainty everyone desires.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister has lost sight of that aim, in his determination to wind back the impact of native title claims. He has gone too far in bending to the demands of the National Party for "virtual" extinguishment of native title. He has failed to recognise that pandering to those who want to overturn the High Court's decisions in Mabo and Wik will not work in the long run. Aborigines are not going to give up their struggle for land rights even if they lose this particular battle.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some changes to the Native Title Act are essential. But the Government is wrong to try to remove such native title rights as may be recognised under existing common law and the Native Title Act. Besides, if the ALRC is right, this legislation will probably fail.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been waiting for some time to talk on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . This government has set out to do what the previous government could not do, which is to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> address the myriad problems that are contained within the flawed legislation of the Native Title Act 1993, commonly known as the Mabo act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is nearly four years now since we have seen an act which was supposed to benefit the indigenous people of Australia but which has benefited nobody but wealthy lawyers&mdash;on that point I agree with the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis)&mdash;bureaucrats and those from the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of history now that the existing legislation has seen only one determination of native title in this country. That is pretty extraordinary for an act which has been in force for over four years. As I have said in this place before, over 1,383 applications have been lodged with the Native Title Tribunal. Of those, 596 were claimant applications. In support of those claimant applications, ATSIC has spent $90 million in legal fees&mdash;$90 million to deliver zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, while I am talking about that, it makes me wonder about the judicious handling of some of these funds from ATSIC&mdash;the sum of $16 billion over the last 12 years, over $1 billion a year, and yet we are told that 30 per cent of children in Alice Springs suffer from malnutrition. The decision to spend this sort of money, $90 million on the 600 claims, was made by ATSIC's own economic section, so I think they have got their priorities wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition have said they will cooperate with the government in terms of greater certainty for stakeholders, for greater workability and for timely resolution of disputes. In fact, I sat and listened to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in his response to this bill's introduction. He has acknowledged that the 1993 act needed remedial attention; that if they had remained in government&mdash;typically, in their old 14th year&mdash;they would have got around to it. But we know that they did not. It is unworkable and it has to be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see this bill being attacked for some apparent unconstitutionality. I have boiled it down to three main reasons that the Labor Party oppose this bill. They are opposing it for these reasons: the racial discrimination 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8955"> clause, the right to negotiate clause, and the sunset clause. There are other aspects, but they are the three main issues that the Labor Party seem to be taking up with this 1997 bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP alleges that requiring the claimants to be more accountable in their claims and the fact that claims are of one particular racial group constitute racism and contravene the Racial Discrimination Act&mdash;hence its attack on its constitutionality. It is a pretty long bow, pretty spurious. In fact, the ALP says that, because it does not satisfy the Racial Discrimination Act, it would be subject to High Court attacks and therefore struck down. Quite honestly, I think that the opposition know that that is not true. In fact, they say its constitutionality is flawed because it is a dilution, as I said, of the group's rights, but do they not have the same accountability? Are they not required to be accountable?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would say, using the pendulum analogy, that the rights have swung to one particular racial group. In fact, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said on many occasions that the rights have swung far too far. This legislation brings the situation back to a more cohesive and a fairer middle ground. This legislation is not racially discriminatory. In legal advice to the government from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, several opinions state that this legislation is not discriminatory. In fact, it just goes to the fact that the Australian Labor Party is trying to turn this into a race debate, as we saw the member for Banks (Mr Melham) do in the Northern Territory recent election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until it can be proven otherwise&mdash;there was the introduction of Mabo in 1993&mdash;there is no precedent that this matter is racially discriminatory. In fact, it is just posturing from the Australian Labor Party. There is no evidence&mdash;it is only conjecture and hearsay&mdash;that any of these matters would be proven to be racially discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the industry groups were interested in delivering real title, they would not jump on this as a racial issue. The previous speaker spent half his time talking about past injustices. We all agree that there have been many past injustices, not only to one particular 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> racial group but to many groups, including women and orphans. What we are saying is that that is wrong and these things must not proceed. I believe this bill addresses real fairness in terms of Aboriginal rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of continuing to turn this into a race debate&mdash;which those in the opposition seem to do every time they get up&mdash;and saying that this legislation is racist, they really should concentrate on legitimate racial concerns. If you cry wolf over this bill, people will not believe you in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I address the Law Reform Commission's criticism of this bill in their draft which was waved around today. Alan Rose, who has attacked the constitutionality of this bill&mdash;as was said by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams)&mdash;was a former employee of that department. He is a former disgruntled lawyer of the Attorney-General's Department. In fact, he is obviously one of the Labor Lawyers; he belongs to the Labor Lawyers association. He is an acolyte acting on behalf of the Labor Party in terms of this matter. He is simply doing their bidding. He knows that he comes from one philosophical viewpoint. If you want to go out and get an opinion on any matter from a QC, those who interpret the law can interpret it their way. This is what Mr Rose is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney-General's advice to the government is that the bill is not unconstitutional. In fact, his chief counsel has told him that this bill certainly does not contravene the Racial Discrimination Act and that it is constitutional. In fact, as has been said earlier today, the Law Reform Commission should look at matters which are put before it by the government, as it is in its terms of reference. This has been pointed out on many occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks agreed, when he was the chair of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in the previous parliament, that the Law Reform Commission should address their terms of reference, not have a roving brief. But here they have gone off and decided to submit their views on native title, which they were not asked to do. They did not have these terms of reference. There are many negative submissions, and they have already been put to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8956"> joint committee on native title, which is currently having hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Law Reform Commission is clearly going outside its brief, it would be interesting to know if it has misused its funds in doing so&mdash;by going outside of its brief and seeking extra work which is not part of its terms of reference. In fact, I hope that in the next Senate estimates committee hearings somebody asks just that question: is the commission awash with personnel and funds so that it can have this roving brief?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am talking about lawyers and the interest in this Native Title Bill, I feel compelled to refer to Mr Ian Viner QC, who is also a member of the Reconciliation Council and a lawyer who defends Aboriginal claims. As a member of the Reconciliation Council, he gets his sitting fee as a lawyer. He has a vested interest in defending these claims. As a former minister in this parliament, he continues to get his superannuation. He should declare this and let us know that he has a commercial interest in this. He should stop milking it for his own commercial want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with those who say that native title is about justice, social cohesion, welfare and cultural identity, but you cannot just talk about those matters and leave out the economic realities that native title has not delivered either social justice or economic justice. So to people like Ian Viner, I say: cut the rhetoric and support a government which is going to do something about the certainty for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, in my own state of Western Australia&mdash;the state most affected by native title&mdash;around 82 per cent is under some form of native title claim. Much has been said about the cost to the mining industry since this act came in. We know that the mining industry not only contributes huge amounts to Australia's export economy but creates jobs. Some say that there is growth despite the native title problem, and I am sure that is true in many areas, but it is also true that it is holding up the whole matter of certainty in the mining industry. That goes towards Australia's national interest and jobs for people who are desperately seeking work. We say that you should take all these matters into 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> account rather than be diverted on some of the more spurious allegations. It is vital to our economic development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give you an example: the Mirriuwang &hyphen;Gajerrong case, which is currently in the Kimberleys. This case is holding up the second stage of development on the Ord River dam project. This project is worth untold millions, not only to the state of Western Australia but to Australia. There are people laying spurious claims over that area. They know that they do not have a legitimate title right to that area but they think that, if they can register an interest, there is a good chance, by being involved in the right to negotiate, of some sort of financial settlement, if it is settled before it can be decided in legislation. This is true of a number of projects north of the 26th parallel, especially in Western Australia. They have just been held up because of the overlapping claims and the unholy interest in being registered as having a claim and the right to negotiate and what that does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been achieved so far? All we have seen is the granting of one title, and that was at Crescent Head in New South Wales. Unbelievably, that was outside of this legislation&mdash;an agreed title&mdash;and it was paid out at 150 per cent of its real value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen numerous compensation claims paid out. For example, the Anaconda mining project in Western Australia recently negotiated a claim with the local claimants. But, by agreeing to a claim outside any legal framework, the legitimacy of that claim is thrown into doubt in relation to its absolute land title. In other words, you can negotiate an agreement over a particular mining area, but at some time in the future you will again have a problem when either that particular agreement finishes or that mining tenement finishes. This is because native title has not been decided even though there might have been a commercial agreement. That does not give certainty to anybody, especially future generations of claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only certainty is negotiation within the framework of the legislation. We are addressing this by ensuring that all claims can be made through the act. This simplified act will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8957"> be there to ensure legitimacy and certainty for all time. As I have said, we have seen overlapping claims which do not appear to resolve anything; all they do is create a huge bureaucratic backlog.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's biggest stumbling point in this is, as I have said, the right to negotiate provision, which contributes to the problem with overlapping claims. In relation to the right to negotiate, let me say that I could not believe it when the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) said the right to negotiate was in common law. It is not. The right to negotiate was never part of the 1993 act. It was referred to in the preamble&mdash;just as Keating referred to the fact that there was no native title over pastoral leases&mdash;but the opposition always sought to treat it as a core part of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure this House that there is no common law right over areas that have been part of a claim. That point really needs to sink in, because the Leader of the Opposition came into this House and said that there is a common law right over this land, which is just not true. In fact, when challenged later by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), conceded that that is the case, but that at some time in the future there may be a common law right. Saying that there may be a common law right is a lot different from saying there is a common law right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labour Party really should get this right. They should understand that they are misleading the people of Australia by telling them that people who lay a claim have a common law right over that land. It is just not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the structure of the right to negotiate provision is inefficient because it allows multiple groups and overlapping claims. Our amendments to the right to negotiate provisions will streamline the process so that unnecessary delays are eliminated while maintaining the protection of the legitimate interests of the native title holders and claimants.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But nothing can be done until the right to negotiate provision is addressed, because everybody loses out; the claimants themselves experience delays. In fact, as I have said, no claims have been settled other than the one in New South Wales, which was negotiated. The Aboriginals are missing out. I can assure you that they individually tell us that they are pretty angry that they cannot determine these matters on their behalf. We have seen the farce involving Century Zinc where a large number of people claimed the same area. The right to negotiate was sorted out, but the actual claim on the land was not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to laugh when I hear people talking about this being a pastoral lease issue. It is not. There are 66 claims over crown reserves, drainage reserves and road reserves in one city in my electorate of Swan, and yet people think it is just an agricultural or pastoral lease situation. It is not. The City of Belmont has all these claims over its parks and reserves. For example, because of the right to negotiate provision, at Forster Park in Belmont, if the council wants to extend a toilet block, they have to enter into negotiation provisions with the local Aboriginal claimants, which is totally ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that there are overlapping claims in Perth. Not only are there three overlapping claims on the Perth airport, but there is another overlapping claim which starts north of Perth in Gidgegannup and goes right down to the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia. Part of my backyard was part of a claim. When the council tried to put sewerage in my backyard, which is near the Swan River, they were not allowed to do it because it was subject to a native title claim. They had to go down to the front, to my road. When they say your backyard is not claimable, that is just not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other examples of vexatious claims. We have to be suspicious about the motives, because there is more money in the right to negotiate than there is in awarding native title. This point has been made on many occasions. You will get far more out of the right to negotiate than you will get out of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8958"> the awarding of title. The threshold test needs to apply immediately so as to strike out these vexatious claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP's willingness to have Aboriginal claimants involved too early in the process will cause problems because it stalls a resolution for all parties. Strangely, the ALP agrees that, even though it may be discriminatory, the registration or the threshold test should be tightened up&mdash;this is because they realise the inefficiency of multiple claims&mdash;but they want the right to negotiate to continue to run parallel with the registration test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The threshold test will determine whether, under the original Mabo legislation, there was a legitimate claim. We know that the legitimate claim test is that claimants have had a continuous association with the land over a long period of time. But this has to be a physical attachment to the land, not a spiritual attachment. As Judith Watson, a former Labor member in Western Australia, said in relation to the Yackabindie nickel project, the planes could not fly over the project because the spirits would be entering heaven and that would contravene some right. That is crazy. How high would a plane have to fly over the project before it did not contravene a right?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to move to the matter of the sunset clause. The ALP's third major disagreement with our legislation is the sunset clause which will come into effect six years after the implementation of this legislation. I should point out that claimants can go to the Federal Court if their claims are rejected by the tribunal. If, after the amount of publicity, a claim has not been made in the six&hyphen;year period, I will be most surprised if people do not continue to find and resurrect pieces of land that were not found in that six&hyphen;year period. The 10&hyphen;point plan legitimately delivers native title to the claimants, and certainly to the land&hyphen; and leaseholders. It has brought the act and the spirit of native title back to the middle ground. Hopefully, we will begin to see more indigenous people gain from the changes to the act. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard I had previously announced that the new lessees of Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports are contractually committed to long&hyphen;term development obligations&mdash;including substantial investment commitments in core airport infrastructure&mdash;totalling over half a billion dollars over the next 10 years. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8959"> Moreover, this investment is being made under a post&hyphen;privatisation pricing regime which will see a real decline in aeronautical service charges over the next five years in line with expected productivity improvements at these airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Innovative management practices are already becoming evident with the announcement by the new Melbourne airport lessees that rebates of up to 50 per cent on aeronautical charges are available to airlines, on application, offering new services and up to 30 per cent for those increasing frequency of existing services to and from Melbourne airport. Available on a decreasing scale for three years, the aim of this measure, with direct benefits to the travelling public, is to lower operating costs for start&hyphen;up services and to facilitate the growth of services considered viable in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of the Sydney basin airports, which are Kingsford Smith, Hoxton Park, Bankstown, and Camden airports, will take place only after completion of an environmental assessment of options for the site for the second Sydney airport and when the government has effectively addressed noise issues relating to Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this phase of the sales program, 10 regular public transport (RPT) and five general aviation (GA) airports are to be disposed of. It is proposed, as for phase 1 sales, the eight RPT airports at Adelaide, Alice Springs, Canberra, Coolangatta, Darwin, Hobart, Launceston and Townsville will be sold by long&hyphen;term leasehold. Each lease would be for 50 years with an option for an additional 49 years. These sales can, of course, be undertaken under the existing provisions of the Airports (Transitional) Act 1996 and will be subject to the same Commonwealth regulatory controls that apply to the phase 1 airports as provided for under the Airports Act 1996 and associated regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion, however, the government wishes to have the flexibility of offering the five GA airports at Archerfield, Essendon, Jandakot, Moorabbin, and Parafield and the two RPT airports at Mount Isa and Tennant Creek for freehold disposal. A freehold disposal of these airports, however, requires 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendments to be made to the Airports (Transitional) Act 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I turn to the specifics of the proposed amendments I would like to briefly elaborate on the reasons for the government's decision. While the airports included in phase 1 were all airports of national and international significance, the 15 airports in phase 2 are diverse. Some are major national airports while others are principally of regional and local significance, many with a large general aviation base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Freehold sale of the general aviation airports and the smaller regional airports will provide greater opportunities for those airports to be integrated into the policy and planning frameworks of state and local authorities. The sites would cease to be Commonwealth places and in the future the states and territories would assume the responsibility for planning and environment controls on the airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is logical and consistent with the practice adopted under the previous government's aerodrome local ownership program where some 230 local airports were transferred under freehold title to local owners, a number of which are far larger in terms of revenue and aircraft traffic volumes than some of those now being proposed to be disposed of by freehold sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the major airports, these airports are principally intrastate in their traffic and their non&hyphen;aviation activities are more locally orientated, with a local community focus and impact. A freehold sale of these airports provides an opportunity for a strengthened association with local community interests&mdash;those best placed to influence the development and operation of the airports in a manner conducive to fulfilling regional aspirations&mdash;without a Commonwealth overlay of controls in the areas of planning and environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Existing Commonwealth controls over safe operations, flight paths and aircraft noise would be unaffected, but the question of how an airport's operations interlink and interact with the community in which it is located would become a matter for the state or territory concerned. The Commonwealth will require, however, before an airport is sold 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8960"> freehold that the relevant state government undertakes to ensure that state or territory and local laws do not jeopardise continued airport operations and that the core airport site will be restricted to continued use as such. The Commonwealth wants to ensure that any airport sold freehold continues to be used as an airport, and is reserving the option of leasing any of these airports if the required assurances are not forthcoming from the relevant state or territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As mentioned earlier, in order to allow for freehold sale of some of the phase 2 airports it is necessary to amend the Airports (Transitional) Act 1996. Those amendments are contained in schedule 1 to the bill and their main provisions are to facilitate the transfer of: land from the Federal Airports Corporation to the purchaser; the assets, liabilities, contracts and employees directly to the purchaser following the transfer of land; and the relevant staff at each of the airports to the purchaser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the phase 1 sales, it will be important that the jobs and entitlements of FAC staff at the airports to be sold will not be threatened by the disposal process. Therefore, whether the airports are to be leased or sold, staff and management will be transferred to the relevant airport entity immediately upon sale. Existing awards, enterprise agreements and contracts of employment will transmit to the new airport lessees or airport entity which will ensure that airport staff retain key terms and conditions of employment and entitlements to accrued benefits following their transfer. Following the transfer of staff, the terms and conditions of their employment, as contained in awards, enterprise agreements and contracts of employment, will be able to be varied only according to the terms of those agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two minor amendments to the stamp duty provisions in the Airports (Transitional) Act. Firstly, item 14 of the bill provides that, post sale, an entity is not liable to stamp duty in respect of an instrument which was executed by the FAC before sale. This is an extension of the existing provisions under section 47 of the Airports (Transitional) Act in regard to a leasehold disposal. Its purpose 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is to ensure that an airport company does not become liable to pay stamp duty in respect of an instrument to which the FAC was party and which was formerly exempt from duty. Any alteration to the instrument after sale which would attract stamp duty is not exempted by this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, item 15 of the bill is to extend the application of section 48 of the Airports (Transitional) Act to freehold entities. Section 48 ensures that stamp duty is payable in circumstances where the sale is affected by making of a declaration vesting the freehold in the airport entity. That section provides that, where stamp duty would have otherwise been payable, it is not exempt just because the transfer of the airport was affected by a ministerial declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one minor amendment, item 16, to the special income tax rules in the legislation and that is to extend to a freehold entity the power of the minister to make a declaration that the Income Tax Assessment Act applies to the FAC as though it had received payment for the disposal. This provision was used in the phase 1 sales to declare the value for tax purposes on the assets disposed by the FAC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the phase 1 sales, I am not proposing to utilise the determination provisions available in sections 49, 50 and 51 of the Airports (Transitional) Act. For the purposes of their bids, prospective purchasers will be advised that they should value the airports on the basis of depreciation arrangements that are consistent with those outlined in the Treasurer's press release of 4 August 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also contains amendments to the Airports Act 1996 which are proposed to streamline the regulatory regime for the leased federal airports. Schedule 2 of the bill covers four main areas, which I will deal with in turn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, section 5 of the Airports Act specifically defines a joint&hyphen;user airport as Canberra, Darwin and Townsville. The Department of Defence is currently considering the nature of its operations at Canberra Airport and the status of the airport may change in the future. The bill will amend section 5 of the Airports Act to enable a regulation to be made declaring that Canberra would no longer 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8961"> be a joint&hyphen;user airport at such time as the Department of Defence chooses to cease operating at that airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, section 33 of the Airports Act provides that an airport lessee company cannot enter into an airport management agreement with another person unless that person is both approved in writing by the minister and a qualified company within the meaning given under the act. The Airports Act also provides that the minister cannot approve an airport management company if it breaches ownership restrictions under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the ownership restrictions in part 3 of the act already apply to an airport management company, the provision is unnecessary and so the bill provides for the requirement to be repealed. In its place the Minister for Transport and Regional Development will retain a simple power to determine by disallowable instrument whether a specific agreement is, or is not, an airport management agreement, and to not approve any agreements if there are concerns with them. The government wishes to take advantage of the benefits that foreign management expertise can bring to Australia's airports, but it remains important that any structures designed to circumvent the public policy objectives of the legislation can be denied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, section 192 of the act provides that the minister may determine that each airport service provided at an airport will be a declared service for the purposes of the access regime set out in part 111A of the Trade Practices Act 1974, except to the extent to which a service is the subject of an access undertaking given within 12 months after the airport is leased to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes to give authority to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, to determine by disallowable instrument which activities at an airport fit within the relevant definition of an `airport service' as a result of a determination by the minister. This amendment will ensure that the ACCC has the capacity to clarify situations where doubt arises about the scope of an `airport service' that has been declared as a result of the minister's determination.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, subsection 242(1) of the Airports Act provides for applications to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of certain decisions made by the minister. Those decisions concern the approval of master plans, major development plans and environment strategies, including variations to master plans and major development plans and environment strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the act, the airport lessee is required to undertake wide public consultation prior to submitting draft master plans, major development plans and environment strategies to the minister for approval. The minister then either approves or refuses to approve the draft plans having regard to the matters to be considered as set out in the act, including: whether an airport development would assist airport users; how the airport and surrounding areas are affected; comments made by interested and affected parties as part of the public consultation process; and the environmental impact. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These procedures are comprehensive and permit soundly based decisions to be made by the minister. The amendments ensure that these decisions will be open to the scrutiny of the parliament. The minister is required to prepare and table in both houses of parliament a statement about these decisions, except to the extent that the commercial interests of a person would be substantially prejudiced. This will also bring these provisions into line with planning processes under state law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to these four changes, the bill will insert a number of notes to existing sections of the Airports Act to clarify the way in which state law applies to airport activities. Schedule 3 of the bill extends the corporation's functions to include assisting in the sale of a federal airport by way of freehold disposal. This removes any ambiguity as to whether the corporation is empowered to assist in the disposal of its assets by this means and provides the board with an assurance that they are clearly operating within their responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The additional amendment to section 41 of the FAC Act clarifies that information obtained by the government under a ministerial direction given before the commencement of the amendment may be used after its com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8962"> mencement. This ensures that there is no perceived legal impediment to using the information in connection with any freehold sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to note that the government's airport sales process and the post&hyphen;sale regulatory regime, which has been put in place, is making Australia a world leader in airport ownership and management. It provides the opportunity for the utilisation of private sector investment and expertise at Australia's airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is already a great deal of investor interest in the next tranche of airports, particularly in regional areas. The proposed measures outlined in this bill will maximise the opportunities for the development of regional airports and will provide a more streamlined and effective regulatory regime. Given the need to provide certainty to airport bidders and airport users, it is essential that this legislation be passed in the current sittings to meet the airport sales timetable. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That Senate amendment No. 2 be disagreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment to clause 37, page 23, after subclause (2), seeks to include the words `The Attorney-General must not issue a certificate in respect of information requested of the Auditor-General by a House of the Parliament, a committee of a House of the Parliament or a joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House of Representatives does not accept the amendment for two reasons. First, it is the proper role of the elected executive to bear responsibility for preventing damage to the public interest. It is the executive which will be held accountable to the parliament and ultimately to the electorate for its performance in that regard. Secondly, the framework of clause 37, as amended by the Senate, would provide scope for the Auditor&hyphen;General to be drawn in as an unwitting party to the often political issues that members and senators may wish to pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some difficulties in understanding why the Labor Party came to the conclusion they did in the debate on this particular amendment in the Senate. I note that Senator Cook stated in his remarks on this amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is possible to construct scenarios in which some matter may be being sought to be inquired of by a parliamentary committee which does border on the national interest or directly impinge on the national interest or some state secret.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say that it is generally the case that parliamentary committees are made up in the majority by members of the government and, therefore, the government would act to protect the national interest, to protect national interest issues. I think that clearly indicates what this particular section is all about as it stands in the bill before it was amended by the Senate and it perhaps indicates what the Senate had in mind in seeking to amend it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8963">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 37 of the bill is specifically relevant to those areas which apply to national security. I would have thought that all members of this House would appreciate that it should not be left open for the Auditor-General to be interfered with in his decisions on matters of national security and national interest or, for that matter, for it to be left in the hands of a committee of the parliament to seek information that would go into the public arena in a way that could do great damage to Australia's standing on an international basis or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that in the drafting of the bill, as it was originally passed by this House, the government had this in mind, and I had many discussions on the need to ensure, firstly, that there was an unfettered power there for the Auditor-General as an officer of the parliament entrenched by these bills and, secondly, that the Auditor-General was not embroiled in political controversy brought about by some decision of a committee whereby the majority on that committee were not members of the executive government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 37 replicates a framework which has been in operation in the Audit Act 1901 for almost 20 years. The scope for intervention by the Attorney-General to prevent disclosure of particular kinds of information on public interest grounds is not extensive. In view of discussions I had on that very point, it was considered appropriate that the Attorney-General, again in the national interest, should give a certificate to the Auditor-General as to why information should be withheld by the Auditor-General. Again, that is to ensure that the maximum amount of accountability was there and at the same time we did not interfere with the national interest and particularly, as I say, the national security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are provisions to prevent information being forthcoming that might prejudice matters before a court. Of course, this just entrenches the sub judice rule. One can appreciate the fact that that can do untold damage to many people in the community if a committee of the parliament could take advantage of information that had been brought to its attention to circumvent what 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should surely be in the interests of justice in this country of ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reasons listed in clause 37(2) for the Attorney-General to issue the certificate relate only to matters of genuine importance and significance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> If one were to imagine a worst case scenario that could occur under the Senate amendment it is possible to see how damage could be caused to Australia's national or international security and how the integrity of the Commonwealth's position could be undermined in ways that caused genuine damage to Australia. Accordingly, the House of Representatives believes that it is not worth the risk to accept the Senate amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House of Representatives believes that the framework in clause 37, unamended, has been proven to operate in a realistic and sensible way, having been used only once for reasons of national security. Moreover, clause 37 as drafted provides an added measure of accountability on the executive in that it compels the Auditor-General to report any intervention by the executive and the reasons for it. The House of Representatives believes that the framework provided for in clause 37 is sound and therefore disagrees with the Senate amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only point of difference between the opposition and the government on this whole package of legislation relates to clause 37. The legislative package itself dates back to 1989 and the work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It lapsed in previous years, principally because of an obstructive opposition at the time. As the Labor opposition, we support the legislative package. It is largely our creation. Whilst the former opposition delayed the package literally for years, in this parliament we have facilitated quick passage and intend to continue doing so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth needs modern financial systems in legislation and this package will deliver that. However, there is one matter of contention, and that relates to the power of the executive to gag the Auditor-General. Labor accepts that in some situations the national interest will be served by the non-disclosure of some information&mdash;for example, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8964"> sensitive Defence or foreign relations information. We agree with that position and, accordingly, support the right of the Attorney-General to issue a certificate under clause 37 in appropriate circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that this power currently exists and apparently has been used only once over the last 20 years or so. I believe it was during the time of the Fraser government. However, the amendment which the Senate agreed to is designed to stop potential abuse of what is by any yardstick a very wide power given to the Attorney-General. The amendment of the Senate, whilst maintaining the general power of the Attorney, qualifies it in one important respect&mdash;namely, that the Attorney cannot issue a certificate to silence the Auditor-General about an issue on which the parliament, or a committee of the parliament, has requested information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as the reserve power for the Attorney is important, so too is a legislative guarantee against the abuse of that power. Indeed, the unfortunate recent episode where we saw the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) seeking to gag the Law Reform Commission is a striking and contemporary illustration of the need for this kind of protection. We have had the Law Reform Commission seeking to make a submission concerning the native title legislation. We have had clear evidence that the Attorney-General has interfered with that process. His defences have been that this issue is outside the charter of the Law Reform Commission, yet the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Nick Minchin, has sought himself the views of the Law Reform Commission on the native title and Wik legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Law Reform Commission routinely comments on inquiries by parliamentary committees. Indeed, the Attorney-General had to own up this afternoon to having tabled an annual report which gave a number of examples of that process in action. The Attorney-General had not even bothered to read it, according to his response this afternoon. The real reason for that attempt by the Attorney-General at suppression was political&mdash;the embarrassment of the government at the Law Reform Commission's findings that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government's proposed native title legislation may be unconstitutional, may involve massive taxpayer compensation, may be in breach of this nation's international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was never a problem before that the Law Reform Commission made submissions to parliamentary committees and other bodies. So for this government, when the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) attacks Aborigines, that is free speech and ought to be celebrated but, when the Law Reform Commission wants to tell the government some home truths and tries to support Aborigines, that material ought to be suppressed and never see the light of day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, this is not the kind of Attorney-General whom we would want to see having the kind of unlimited power which the government is seeking to provide for with its provision. It is clearly a political use of the Attorney-General's power to suppress what he has been engaging in. The matter was reported to the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) by the Chief of Staff to the Attorney&hyphen;General, Mr Hugh Funder. He spoke with the principal private secretary to the Prime Minister, Tony Nutt, to let him know what was going on. This was all about high politics, not some appropriate and genuine concern on the part of the Attorney-General about the Law Reform Commission exceeding its powers.</PARA>

I am interested to know exactly in the terms of this particular amendment of the Senate whether it in fact would make the Auditor-General more answerable to the parliament, as was, in my view, the understanding of the role of the Auditor-General. I refer to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> , which specifically says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Audit Act provides that reports of the Auditor&hyphen;General must be forwarded to the Speaker for presentation to the House, and this is illustrative of

<PARA STYLE="Para">I would have thought that the Democrats' amendment in the Senate is in fact enhancing the relationship between the Auditor-General and the parliament rather than perhaps reinforcing the relationship of the Auditor-General as a creature of or answerable to the executive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, in response to the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), I can indicate that, if the honourable member for Moore looks at section 37 and the subsections there in terms of the provisions that are applicable, the circumstances in which the Attorney-General can in fact issue a certificate is very clear. That certificate can only be issued by the Attorney-General and, of course, reported on by the Attorney-General to the parliament where it is in the public interest to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is about a protection of areas. I would have thought that the honourable member for Moore would understand more than anyone else that information will be forthcoming from committees of this parliament on a regular basis where the government is not in the majority, particularly in another place, if there is an opportunity given for base political purposes. I seek to avoid the national interest being affected by such decisions that are taken for base political purposes. I certainly would want to avoid any risk being put to national security. That is the basis for the clause as drafted. That right, that protection, is taken away by the amendment moved by the Democrats in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very limited opportunities for the Attorney-General to issue such a certificate. I have indicated that in the past 20 years it has occurred on one occasion. I would have thought that the honourable member for Moore could imagine many situations in any single week where information is in the national interest. Dare I say it, events in New Guinea and Bougainville earlier this year might have been fairly relevant, but it would not have been in this government's interest

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The reasons read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senate Amendment Number 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment proposes clause 37, page 23 after subclause (2) be supplemented to include that the Attorney&hyphen;General must not issue a certificate in respect of information requested of the Auditor&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8966"> General by a House of the Parliament, a committee of a House of the Parliament or a joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament. The House of Representatives does not accept the amendment for two reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it is the proper role of the elected Executive to bear responsibility for preventing damage to the public interest  and it is the Executive which will be held accountable by the Parliament and, ultimately, the electorate for its performance in that regard. Secondly, the framework of clause 37, as amended by the Senate, would provide scope for the Auditor&hyphen;General to be drawn in as an unwitting party to the, often, political issues that Members and Senators may wish to pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 37 replicates a framework that has been in operation in the Audit Act 1901 for almost 20 years. The scope for intervention by the Attorney&hyphen;General to prevent disclosure of particular kinds of information on public interest grounds is not extensive. The reasons listed in Clause 37(2) for the Attorney&hyphen;General to issue a certificate relate only to matters of genuine importance and significance. If one were to imagine a worst case scenario that could occur under the Senate amendment, it is possible to see how damage could be caused to Australia's national or international security and how the integrity of the Commonwealth's position could be undermined in ways that caused genuine damage to Australia. Accordingly, the House of Representatives believes that it in not worth the risk to accept the Senate amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives believes that the framework in Clause 37, unamended, has been proven to operate in a realistic and sensible way, having been used only once, for reasons of national security. Moreover, Clause 37, as drafted, provides an added measure of accountability on the Executive in that it compels the Auditor&hyphen;General to report any intervention by the Executive and the reasons for it. The House of Representatives believes that the framework provided for in clause 37 is sound and therefore disagrees with the Senate amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today I received a letter from a man in Nambour, Queensland, in the electorate of Fairfax. Over the last couple of days, both in this place and in the Main Committee, we have been debating quite extensively the firearm reforms. I want to take the opportunity to congratulate everybody concerned with that. I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House doing that, but I cannot let the opportunity go by without congratulating the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the premiers, the chief ministers and indeed the Australian people. That effort involved a lot of reasonable people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This letter that I have received reflects the view of a minority group of unreasonable people.

I do not know that you understand the way you are being manipulated by these minority groups, and that was reflected in your speech earlier in the day in this place on native title. You talk about one nation conspiracy theories and new world orders. That is quite ridiculous. You are being driven by some of these vociferous minority groups. It is about time you grew up and knew exactly what was happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Mr Speaker, I would like to raise this letter as a matter of privilege. Before you came in, I provided a copy of this letter to the clerk and I seek your guidance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of weeks ago Channel 9 and News Limited, in conjunction with the CES, ran a Jobs for Australia campaign. They should be commended for that, as should the employers of Australia that offered the 20,000 jobs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Corporations and business will not deliver full employment. Why would they? They do not have the long-term responsibility for stability and families that governments can have. Governments need to lead. Governments need to set the policy environment in order to seek the cooperation of corporations, business and labour unions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Foreign Affairs</EMPHASIS> volume 75 No. 3, Ethan Kapstein, Director of Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States, made a number of points about globalisation and its impact on employment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The global economy is leaving millions of disaffected workers in its train . . .</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For generations students were taught that increasing trade and investment, coupled with technological change, would drive national productivity and create wealth. Yet over the past decade despite a continuing booming international trade and finance, productivity has faltered and inequality in the United States and unemployment in Europe has worsened . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In globalisation's previous incarnation governments had done little to protect working people from its

<PARA STYLE="Para">Kapstein argues that governments are trying to break their postwar deal with workers while maintaining their commitment to an open economy. Governments cannot have it both ways and, instead, the policy focus should be on negotiating a package that helps workers adjust to ongoing changes. Kapstein says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the concern is incoming inequality, policies should be adopted to close the income gap. If the concern is unemployment more jobs should be created. In developing positive solutions however, it is important to recognise that declining rates of economic growth caused largely by a drop off in productivity are hurting all workers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Governments from the mid&hyphen;1980s until now have adopted policies deemed sustainable or credible by financial markets. These policies have privileged stability over employment, according to Kapstein. Restrictive economic policies, reduced deficits, reduced spending, reduced taxes and&mdash;the most exalted deity&mdash;low inflation have favoured financial interests at the expense of workers. Politicians and public officials who adopt these restrictive measures are labelled `responsible' by editorialists, and the markets reward their behaviour sustaining the ideology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kapstein says that governments essentially have four choices to assist their unskilled and semi&hyphen;skilled work force. The first choice is protectionism, which is a remedy worse than the disease. The second is education and training, and that is perhaps the only policy intervention that meets with universal approval. Democratic societies should be financed. It makes for good politics and good economics. But, in the near term, it cannot provide the solution to the structural problems of employment and inequality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third approach is to increase the number of jobs through public works programs and employment subsidies to the private sector. Public job creation is relatively efficient and socially productive&mdash;since it provides younger workers with needed job experience&mdash;and it can be done fairly quickly. The fourth policy choice is tax reform, and perhaps eliminating income taxes altogether for a large number of the working poor while 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> making them sharply more progressive up the income ladder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the main arguments against an expansionary strategy is that it is inflationary. Certainly, inflation is unwelcome, but so is unemployment, which in this country is more like 13 to 15 per cent and much higher than the admitted rate of almost nine per cent. Kapstein acknowledges that restrictive policies may have been necessary when first conceived in the 1980s to bring stability to financial markets, but they have failed too many people for too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge to all governments is clear: restore growth and opportunity. Unfortunately, in this country of Australia that we all represent, realisation of the message that Ethan Kapstein brings&mdash;who was also one of the proponents of globalisation in a former life&mdash;totally escapes the Howard government.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8975"><TITLE>Telstra: Phonecard Vending Machines</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two Dunkley small businessmen have lost substantial sums of money investing in a phonecard vending machine business that had the backing of Telstra. Mr Gerhard Schulz and Mr Ted Hancock each lost $16,000 by investing in a business opportunity in 1993 promoted by General Vending (Australia) Pty Ltd, an associated company to Del-Marina Pty Ltd, which shared a common director, Mr Rod Montague Laski of Prahran East, Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Laski's companies claimed in advertisements published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in early 1993 a `staggering 40 per cent minimum guaranteed return on your investment'. This same claim was reiterated in subsequent correspondence between Mr Laski and my constituents. The written guarantee promised that only sites that took revenue of at least $340 per week per machine would be selected. Naively but not unnaturally, as the associated company, Del-Marina Pty Ltd, had a distribution agreement with Telstra, they were among at least 19 small investors who believed these claims and purchased phonecard vending machines subsequently deployed at various retail outlets around Melbourne and Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Companies like Telstra and those associated with it have an obligation to behave ethically. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8976"> On 14 October 1994 after the Casualties of Telecom saga with one compensation payment of $2.3 million, Telstra CEO, Mr Blount, said in large advertisements that Telstra embraced `an approach based on honesty and integrity . . . values fundamental to the way we do business'. My constituents assumed Telstra would have conducted a full study on Del-Marina Pty Ltd in view of their distribution agreement and relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra suggested to potential investors that Del&hyphen;Marina would be the sole source of new phonecard distribution outlets. The Telstra phonecard brand name was used in advertisements. My constituents assert that Telstra never enforced its agreement with Del&hyphen;Marina which insisted investors read the distribution agreement, only provided to Mr Schulz four months after he had made his investment. In July 1993 Telstra stated that General Vending Pty Ltd was the trading arm of Del-Marina and that General Vending (Australia) Pty Ltd was now registered as a company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By September 1993 my constituents knew that the claimed return on investment was mythical. Mr Schulz complained to the Trade Practices Commission which advised that, with their limited resources, the matter did not involve widespread consumer detriment and therefore would not be pursued. Despite receiving complaints in mid-1992, Telstra failed to terminate General Vending's contract until 28 October 1993. Telstra knew of Mr Laski from previous dealings and had previously terminated a contract with him. This surprising reaffirmation of faith in Mr Laski by Telstra allowed General Vending to win around $1 million in revenue. Telstra benefited from more phonecard sales and a reduction in vandalism at public phone boxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Telstra offered to allow affected investors to supply phonecards to existing sites, this was impractical because a tiny number of people were supplying large areas by this time in view of the low returns from each machine. By October 1994 Telstra was indicating to Mr Schulz's solicitors that they might consider funding an action against Mr Laski, but nothing came of efforts to get Telstra to fund a class action against Mr Laski or the companies, justified by Telstra on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> basis that General Vending was pending company deregistration. This was despite Telstra engaging solicitors to prepare a class action. Eventually, in April 1995, Telstra offered Mr Schulz $1,600 to use as he saw fit. Mr Rodney Laski did not cease as a director of General Vending (Australia) Pty Ltd until 24 April 1996 but had ceased his directorship with Del-Marina Pty Ltd on 2 February 1993. These vending machines were sold by General Vending for up to $1,800 each.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian Securities Commission records show Mr Laski to be currently the director of eight other companies including Miami Coin International Pty Ltd. Mr Laski's companies have previously been located in the Cadbury-Schweppes building at Level 10, 636 St Kilda Road, Melbourne. About six months ago, he did a `midnight flit' from this building. He now trades at Level 1, 391 St Kilda Road, Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Robyn Peet of Dingley, Victoria, obtained judgment against General Vending Pty Ltd, Del-Marina Pty Ltd and Conmorre Pty Ltd for $71,800 in February 1996. Mrs Peet had been pregnant at the time she originally invested $63,000. Mr Donald Smith obtained a judgment in the county court for $70,000 in November 1995 against Del&hyphen;Marina and Mr Laski. In July this year Telstra wrote to Mr Schulz saying that they were unwilling to reopen their previous goodwill offer or renegotiate. Mr Laski is now offering so-called `club cards' for phone sex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call upon Telstra to put aside its indifference and to again consider doing what it can to assist these investors. The Australian Securities Commission should formally consider whether Mr Laski is a fit and proper person to hold Australian company directorship under section 230 of the Corporations Law. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8976"><TITLE>Western Australian Liberal Party</TITLE>

We know that, in all of the speculation this week, about who is going to come and who is going to go, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) are much more likely to go out than they are to go up. We have seen headlines in recent times such as `PM takes Moylan to task', `Time may soon be up for minister' and `Moylan too ill to fend off her critics'.

Yesterday he refused to be drawn on either of them, either their current performance or their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we know about the Attorney-General? We know that the Prime Minister has no confidence in him because as an Attorney-General he is not in cabinet.

<PARA STYLE="Para">So we can have a WA cabinet minister from the Liberal Party if Allan is back in the show!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would Premier Court want to promote Senator Campbell? Because we know that there is real trouble for Liberal senators in preselections coming up in October and November.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 19 September states there is `serious jockeying for position by incumbents Sue Knowles and Ian Campbell' for the Senate spot. Why do we know that Senator Campbell is in trouble? Because he 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8978"> has let down the WA resources and prospecting industry over section 23(pa), as the parliamentary secretary at the table well knows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, why would Premier Court want to support someone who is letting down Western Australia so badly? Because they are both Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne kids&mdash;they grew up in politics at the feet of Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne. There is another Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne kid&mdash;Senator Lightfoot&mdash;who is prepared to stand up for Western Australia. Today I received in my office a letter dated 26 September from Senator Lightfoot, senator for Western Australia. It is addressed to Senator Ian Campbell, senator for Western Australia, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, and it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is still my unchangeable position, that the section 23(pa) should stay <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">intacto</EMPHASIS>  within the present act. There are no possible suggested amendments that could replace that section, that will be either revenue positive, or recreate the incentive for prospectors to add to the Nation's mineral reserves wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">May I also add, that with the combination of Native Title, Diesel Fuel Rebate capping, the removal of 23(pa), the Western Australia Government's soon to be implemented Gold Royalty, a worrying number of miners are on their fiscal knees. As the Nation's biggest dollar earner, I am becoming increasingly uncomfortable with my Government's indifferent, even irresponsible attitude to the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So let us hope, for the mineral and resources industries in WA, that Senator Campbell's disloyalty to the industry is not rewarded by a promotion into the cabinet over the Attorney&hyphen;General and over the Minister for Family Services. Senator Campbell does not deserve to be promoted on the basis that he has monstrously and massively let down the Western Australia mineral resources and prospecting industries.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8978"><TITLE>Kingscliff High School</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about a school in the Richmond electorate&mdash;Kingscliff High School. This is a very progressive school which has over 1,150 students. The principal, Milton Simmons, has seen the school grow from 400 students from when he became the first principal of the school in 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons for the success of the school is its initiative in reaching out to feeder schools. It has become a standard feature of the high school that students spend some time at feeder primary schools telling the pupils what the high school children are doing, especially in the environmental field. As Milton puts it, it is `kids teaching kids', and it has been very effective. They have been very proactive in environmental work and I fully support and encourage the principal, Milton Simmons, and a number of very professional and dedicated teachers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the school they have the Kingscliff Enviro Club and membership is about one&hyphen;third of the whole school from all age brackets. Their involvement with landcare projects includes dune regeneration work, reafforestation work at Kingscliff and river care. They won the NSW Landcare award in 1996, they were finalists for the Telstra Landcare Education Award in 1996, they won the Banksia Environmental Award in 1996, they were entrants in the NSW Landcare award this year and they are also now putting together a proposal for the United Nations Environment Programme Environmental Youth Forum for South Pacific and Asian nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three students in particular who attended the Australian Youth Forum at the Old Parliament House in Canberra whom I would like to mention: Lara Maciuk, Tammy McDonald and Kim Meighan. Several very positive decisions came out of the conference and particularly the proposal for a youth congress which would talk directly to government. These three and others from the Kingscliff High School are actively working to bring people in the Tweed Valley into environmental programs. They participate in the activities of the local Tweed Valley Family and Youth Support Service&mdash;run by David Neely who is doing a very good job as a youth officer&mdash;and set up a Tweed Coast Youth Council which meets every month at the Kingscliff High School. They are discussing not just environment issues but public transport, other activities and facilities for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lara Maciuk, a 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;old year 11 student was also nominated for the 1998 Young

She is a key member of the Kingscliff Enviro Club which, as I mentioned, were finalists in the NSW Landcare awards to be announced in November. She has represented Australia at the United Nations Youth Forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some other individuals, too, in the electorate that I should mention. Christopher Teitzel of Mount St Patrick's School in Murwillumbah has also been nominated for an award for a CD, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saving the Environment,</EMPHASIS> which he produced and which was sponsored by the Total Catchment Management of the Tweed Valley. Melinda Schubert has been doing a CPA and has been nominated for a career achievement award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The school's rugby union team won a country schools' competition&mdash;the Yeates Shield&mdash;in the electorate of Calare on 21 September. The good old Kingscliff school from the north coast stole the match away from Kinross Wolaroi, scoring twice in the last three minutes&mdash;almost as good as the rugby league game last week&mdash;31 to 29. I note that the son of the member for Calare (Mr Andren) was also playing in the local team but, unfortunately, the boys from the north coast beat them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While it is indeed lamentable that the Australian music industry is foreign owned and controlled, there are many Australian artists who record with these companies and the industry supports thousands of Australian jobs. As free trade and the so&hyphen;called level playing field are destroying our manufacturing and farming sectors, free trade in our music industry in the form of parallel importing will very likely do serious damage to the whole music industry and everyone it supports: production people, workers, and nearly 2000 music retailers&mdash;to name but a few.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best case scenario for price reductions under the government's plan on new releases is only about $2 to $3 per CD.

A recent poll found that 85 per cent of Australians would pay a little more to save jobs and therefore have a better and more secure society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also no guarantee that the price of CDs will fall.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 July this year I conducted a youth forum on drugs at North Sydney Leagues Club. Students from nearly 21 local secondary schools as well as some prominent local guest speakers came along, including Alice Wood, who, at the age of 17, lost her 15-year-old sister, Anna, after she took an ecstasy tablet at a dance party, and Billy Moore, an Australian representative in rugby league who plays football for the local North Sydney Bears.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The discussion on this vital issue was forthright. I learnt from students that drugs such as marijuana and ecstasy are more common and accessible in our local schools than even I previously believed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gone are the stereotypical drug pushers who lurk in public toilets and laneways waiting for kids to finish school for the day. Now the dealers are students in the schools and, despite what older people may think, they no longer have to widely ply their trade. Students these days have more knowledge about where to get drugs than they do about what drugs actually contain and what they can actually do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some students at the forum spoke of peers who turn up to school stoned; others told of the frankness and openness with which marijuana use in particular is spoken about at school. Still others discussed the fairly sophisticated way in which credit for drug purchases is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As our discussions continued, I was amazed at how undisturbed these students appeared to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be about the presence of illegal drugs in their lives, both at school and at parties. The stereotypical North Shore student shows no real intrigue and is not unfamiliar with the different types of drugs available, nor the various methods of use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But from almost all the approximately 40 students in the room I received an overwhelming message: fear campaigns such as the anti-smoking campaign are very effective. The ads show kids how uncool it is to smoke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, some influential figures in the lives of the average teenager send deadly messages. It could be a band like Oasis&mdash;who I happen to like&mdash;or singer Evan Dando, who put their song writing ability down to a permanent drug haze, or actor River Phoenix, whose death from a drug cocktail is attributed to merely `bad karma', that are inspiration for a student to give it a go.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to fight back with a campaign illustrating how you can be successful, drug free and cool at the same time. We need some positive role models.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second demand of students was for a real life education campaign that was not couched in the usual rhetoric of a `teacher knows best' classroom. On the real life effects of drugs, we all have much to learn. For example, I was surprised by Billy Moore's comment that as a professional footballer he cannot stay in a room where people may be smoking marijuana, because the smoke from a joint will penetrate the pores of his skin. Of course, with the random drug tests in professional sport this could mean the end of a sporting career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, it was a guest crown prosecutor who surprised students with a detailed treatise on exactly what goes into uppers like ecstasy, acid, and other laboratory manufactured drugs. He spoke of the contaminated backyard stills where drugs are mixed and cut with various substances in an environment that is a far cry from the sterile surroundings where legal pharmaceuticals are made. He concluded that if drug users could see and smell these garage factories they would not be so keen to ingest the finished products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must be honest with ourselves and our young Australians. There must be a certain 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8981"> degree of acceptance in this battle. Drugs are part of our community, like it or not. So let us teach our young people not merely that drugs are bad but that drugs can interfere with achieving long&hyphen;term goals and can bring about future health problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should respond to the calls from students in my electorate with a two&hyphen;pronged attack. Firstly, we must prove to young Australians that drugs are uncool. Secondly, we must  educate our youth and allow them to make informed decisions as mature, young adults. If we do not respond, then Anna Wood will be just one of many young people in our society who, after making a flippant and ill-informed decision, ended their lives in a manner which allowed them no opportunity to say, `This was a dumb idea after all.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R308">National Firearms Program Implementation Bill</XREF>  had its genesis in the meetings of the Australasian police ministers in May and July of last year and, more particularly, the Port Arthur massacre of 28 April 1996. That massacre certainly encouraged the national campaign intended to bring in tighter gun laws in this country and to ensure a degree of uniformity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be noted at the outset that one of the main accomplishments of the campaign concerned the matter of uniformity. Until the action of the government, with the support of the opposition, we had had a mishmash of different regulations around this country which undermined the credibility and the effectiveness of gun laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go back to the period just after that massacre, we find there was a variation in regards to minimum ages. In Queensland it was 17 years and 13 years on farms. In the ACT it was 18 years for a full licence and no minimum age for club use. In the Northern Territory it was 16 to 18 years. There were different requirements in regards to registration. There were different waiting periods for licensing ranging from five days on renewal in New South Wales to 21 days in all cases in Tasmania, et cetera. As you can see, one of the problems this country faced was the question of a lack of consistency and therefore the ability of people to play off different state and territory regulations where they found restrictions or problems for themselves in obtaining arms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about Port Arthur, whilst it was certainly a massive jolt to this country, it should not be seen in isolation from the broader problem of gun deaths in Australia. It is worth noting that in the period 1987 to 1996, or at least up until Port Arthur, 124 people in Australasia had been gunned down in these massacres. The massacres ranged from the November 1990 Aramoana, New Zealand, massacre of 14 people and a further 13 wounded, through to the more well&hyphen;known ones in this country, such as Hoddle Street and Strathfield.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There had been a clear problem in this country which, unfortunately, the political system failed to deal with. The reason it failed to deal with it was because a minority of people with very determined views were prepared to change their votes due to this one particular issue and so thwart the wishes of the majority of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All surveys in this country have shown the determination of the vast majority of people to support tougher gun laws. If we go back to 1978, nearly two decades ago, a Morgan poll showed that 88.8 per cent were for registration of shotguns and .22 rifles and only 8.1 per cent were against it. That shows there has been consistent support in this country for tougher gun laws. Unfortunately, there had been a degree of political opportunism in this country, but that did not arise in this case, I am pleased to say.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8984">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a minority of people out there who possess guns. We all know that possession of guns leads to certain attitudes in regards to restrictions on registration, licensing, et cetera. There is a minority out there who are prepared to put their votes on the line because of this gun issue and try to control the political system by their willingness to ignore all other issues and, essentially, determine policy in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The momentum after Port Arthur was assisted not only by the determination of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the preparedness of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) to stand by him, but, importantly, by the fact that the opposition did not choose to seek applause from that minority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As early as 5 May, the opposition spokesman in this policy area, Senator Nick Bolkus, made a series of policy statements outlining where Labor stood in regard to tougher gun laws in this country. He called for the implementation of strict controls on the mail&hyphen;order sale of firearms; uniform standards of qualification and training for gun owners; uniform standards for the security and storage of firearms; and a requirement for authorised gun dealers to record all transactions, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also made very clear early on that the minister in this policy area in the previous government, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), had already gone down a large part of this road that we have now reached. Essentially, what we have today are the kinds of measures that he had been pushing through at national ministerial meetings. There has been fundamental support from the major political parties in this system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people who use the rhetoric of the silent majority, middle Australia, the majority of people et cetera, are the same people who will come into this parliament seeking to exploit that minority of people who feel victimised or feel that they suffer from having their rights taken away. The reality is that the majority of people very strongly support these rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extremely important that, at this stage, Australia has accomplished this. All surveys show internationally, particularly in the United States, that there is a clear correlation between attitudes in regard to gun laws and the question of ownership and possession of guns. Unless we bring in these kinds of laws to try to persuade the Australian electorate that you do not need a gun because you fear your next-door neighbour, you do not need a gun because you fear crime rates and you do not need a gun on the off-chance someone breaks into your home, we will have a situation, such as exists in the United States, where there are so many people with a vested interest in ownership that they are prepared to work actively within the political system to avoid restrictions and controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This action then takes place at a very important stage in this country. We know the situation in America, where the National Rifle Association, a hugely funded organisation, has been able to thwart most measures. There were the Baker changes in the last few years, but essentially the NRA has succeeded in inducing a tolerance of a gun culture in society. There are figures that indicate nearly half of American people fear guns. They feel that guns are a significant problem, not only in their community, but in their local schools. I think the figures show that around 30 per cent of people have actually heard a gunshot. That is the kind of situation that this legislation aims to tackle. That is the kind of legislation that we need at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accomplishments are to have a compensation scheme through the Medicare levy increase for the surrendering of guns and for the operation of the various states' and territories' surrender and buyback schemes. Concurrently there is also finance towards a national education campaign in regard to guns. There is also the move towards uniform firearm laws, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8985"> with the licensing of guns and the registration of owners. Related to this, there is an endeavour through the national exchange of police information et cetera to monitor the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst the matters that the opposition would raise in this particular piece of legislation today, which mainly deals with compensation paid for historically prohibited weapons, is the understanding that any surplus would be repaid. Certainly we appreciate that that is in the spirit, as the Attorney&hyphen;General pointed out, of what was intended. We endorse fully the attempt to pick up that point today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter is this question of the distribution of information. The Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, either alone or in conjunction with the Australian Council of Police Ministers, prepared in May of this year advice to the Attorney as to the degree of compliance of each state and territory with the resolutions agreed to by the Australian Council of Police Ministers. The opposition would appreciate if the Attorney&hyphen;General would table advice on the degree to which each of those administrations has accomplished what was sought and the degree to which the public has cooperated. If possible, it would be appreciated, from the point of view of ensuring continued bipartisanship in this policy area, that the Attorney&hyphen;General would provide that kind of material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do know that there has been a very significant level of compliance&mdash;in the area 550,000 to 600,000 weapons surrendered. I would&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very few&mdash;as you note&mdash;who have basically described this as some kind of attack on rights and on liberties, and have conspiracy theories about supranational world governments and all those kinds of crackpot theories. There are people out there who, in other instances, are prepared to run around the place trying to make sure that young kids are gaoled for spitting at them or something, but, at the same time, are essentially saying that these laws are not important, that they are somehow different from other laws in this country and that people have more rights in this case to defy the elected legislature with regard to changing rules.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It concerns me that there seems to be this tone out there that somehow, with regard to weapons possession, you have intrinsically greater rights than other people in terms of adhering to the law. I would like to put on the record a hope that, whilst there is obviously a degree of danger for our police force in enforcing these laws, like any other laws they have to be adhered to, they have to be respected and they have to operate. This was not done, as some people would suggest, as a knee&hyphen;jerk, politically opportunistic measure. It was undertaken because of a very obvious perceived need, because guns are a serious problem in any society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to reiterate that this is not just a matter of trying to deal with active criminality. The problem of guns is more pervasive in everyday society. The kinds of arguments that say that possession of a gun will be of advantage to the home owner with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8986"> regard to burglaries are being absolutely demolished in US criminology work. The fact of life is that, in altercations where a gun is involved in burglary, a gun owned by the owner of the property more often than not is actually used on the owner by the person breaking in, because of the element of surprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That criminology work has been mainly by people like Zimring, who has done a lot of work in this area. He has also traced the lethal nature of guns and the fact that if one compares the degree of assaults involving the use of a knife and a gun, the gun is far more lethal. There is also a very clear correlation relating to availability. If you look at the United States, gun possession is far greater in the south than in the north, west and east, and there is a clear correlation there between gun suicides and gun homicides per capita.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia we know the same point has been made. There has been concern by everyone in our political system about our levels of youth, and more particularly male, suicide. Again, if you look at the statistics on the nature of those deaths, the gun is certainly a very active participant and is essentially a far more useful vehicle for accomplishing that task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gun laws are critically related to the fact of life that most people are not killed by criminals or by their permanent or long&hyphen;term enemies. Most people suffer deaths through their neighbours, their friends, their family, their business partners, in spur of the moment altercations, often arising from trivial matters and with very little forethought. So the availability of a gun is critically related to the question of these deaths that might not have occurred if the gun was not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, the opposition does endorse this measure. It understands fully that these kinds of laws were long overdue, that we had a very big hole in our system because there were different regulations, restrictions, licensing, and waiting times. All of these things fluctuated around the states of Australia and related either to the political facts of that state or, I guess, to some degree, to the culture of the state itself and the degree of power of the rural interests who obviously have a very understandable need in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation allows some continued access for primary producers and exemptions for occasional shooters who are licensed for feral animals. The opposition endorses the measure. It would like to see, as I said earlier, some material in regard to the monitoring of the various levels each state and territory has reached in regard to adherence to these requirements, and it hopes that the government will reiterate its earlier commitment to repaying any surplus from this measure. We know that at this stage there are still calculations to be made in regards to gun shop proprietors who have lost businesses through these changes.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in the main chamber the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) strikingly quoted from an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian.</EMPHASIS>  He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the cumulative horror and disbelief felt by the public coalesced into a determination that Australia not allow a "gun culture" to take hold. It was this firm public resolution that John Howard articulated as a political leader.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has shown absolutely outstanding national leadership in relation to this issue of guns. When as a nation we were riveted by the tragedy at Port Arthur, the Prime Minister stepped forward without being concerned about political popularity, or winning a few votes, and made a very strong, immediate and public stand saying that enough was enough. Credit must also be given to the opposition for supporting the Prime Minister and the government in their determination to ensure that never again would we have a Port Arthur like tragedy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8987">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not known for standing in the parliament and rejoicing at the expenditure of huge amounts of public money, but I must say that I am particularly pleased that almost $300 million has been paid out by the government as a result of the firearms buyback program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned in an interjection when the honourable member for Reid was speaking, some 617,416 weapons have actually been handed in, and now Australia is a much safer place. It is, of course, with respect to this background that I am very pleased to join the debate on the  National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1997 . This bill complements the earlier act, the National Firearms Program Implementation Act l996, which provided for the states and territories to be reimbursed for compensation paid by them in support of the national firearms program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response to the Port Arthur tragedy was indeed a national response. Most of the powers in relation to guns reside in the states and territories, but the Prime Minister and the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) were able to sit down with the police ministers from right around the country and decide that this gun culture was not going to continue and that we ought to have a national response which would ensure that there would be many fewer firearms out there in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996 act proscribed a number of firearms which were prohibited as a result of the nationwide firearms agreement. It was interesting that when the guns buyback took place, there was a whole raft of other weapons out there in the community which were not in the minds of the police ministers when they had their conference in response to the Port Arthur tragedy. The states have actually handed out considerable amounts of money to collect other historically prohibited weapons, such as submachine guns, heavy machine guns and other similar weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand in fact that in the Northern Territory, 22 aircraft cannons were surrendered in that jurisdiction. Technically, what has happened under the buyback is that the states and territories have actually paid out money that was not in accord with the 1996 act. They paid out to bring in weapons, not prohibited as a result of the police minister's agreement, that clearly were well within the spirit of that agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why this very small, brief and concise bill has been introduced to the parliament by the government to complement the earlier legislation. The bill aims to ensure that the Commonwealth reimburses the states and territories for compensation that they have already paid for historically prohibited firearms or other weapons. In a sense, the states and territories have broken the law prior to the passage of this bill. At least, they have paid money given to them by the Commonwealth to bring these weapons in. Everyone in the Australian community believes that these weapons ought to be collected. If the states have gone out there and been proactive and collected weapons within the spirit of the 1996 agreement, clearly this government and this parliament should make sure that they are not out of pocket as a result of that very positive step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was some suggestion that the sole reason for the bill was that the Northern Territory needed to be reimbursed for the $460,000 it paid to the owner of the 22 aircraft cannons. That was certainly one instance. It has also been discovered that, in other states and territories of Australia, compensation has been paid for historically prohibited firearms. It is important that all states and territories be compensated for collecting these historically prohibited weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people have also suggested that maybe this ought to have been an amendment to the 1996 act, but the government decided, on advice and after consideration, that it would be more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8988"> concise and precise if a small specific act was brought in to meet this particular need. That is why we have got this clear, concise bill before the parliament, which certainly does the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people say, `The buyback ended yesterday. What's going to happen with respect to the reimbursement of the states and territories for moneys that they have outlaid not in accordance with the word of the previous law?' The simple facts are that provided these historically prohibited weapons have been surrendered by yesterday, the Commonwealth will be able to reimburse the states and territories with respect to those weapons surrendered. Even though this piece of legislation will not have proceeded through the parliament by 30 September, it will still be possible to compensate the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been speculation, and it was mentioned by the previous speaker, that some members of the parliament are not happy with the national response to the firearms buyback. Overwhelmingly, regardless of political party&mdash;including some independents&mdash;we have spoken with one voice on this issue. The government, the opposition and most other members of the parliament were prepared to join together to ensure that there was an effective national response to the Port Arthur tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was not done as a populist measure or with one eye on the next election; it was done as a matter of principle by the Prime Minister. The Australian people have overwhelmingly endorsed the government proposal. Interestingly, surveys indicate that over 78 per cent of adult Australians are in favour of gun laws and 56 per cent are strongly in favour of the new laws. Unlike many other pieces of legislation which seem to escape many members of the Australian community, overwhelmingly, Australians are aware that the federal parliament has acted, in conjunction with the states and territories, and 96 per cent of people are aware of these reforms. That may well be the reason that we have had some 617,416 weapons handed in and the reason that the Commonwealth has paid out $296,874,323 in compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some people who said that Australians would bury their weapons, that they would do absolutely anything to avoid handing in these prohibited weapons. But I am very pleased that the Prime Minister and the Attorney&hyphen;General have both been proven correct and, overwhelmingly, the people with prohibited weapons have indeed complied with the law of Australia. This indicates that, as an Australian community, we are very responsible. I would like to commend those gun owners who have indeed acted in accordance with the law in handing in their weapons and receiving compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly pleased to support this legislation, coming as it does just one day after the close of the buyback program. As was mentioned by the honourable member for Reid, the buyback was funded as a result of a temporary increase in the Medicare levy. Overwhelmingly, Australians supported this revenue raising measure as a means of fixing up what was a glaring national problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister must be congratulated, as must the Attorney&hyphen;General. And, in a spirit of bipartisanship, the opposition ought also to be congratulated for supporting the reforms of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to the bill, it is a very small bill and it complements the 1996 act. It does enable the states and territories to be compensated for the compensation that they have already paid with respect to historically prohibited weapons, including submachine guns, heavy machine guns and aircraft cannon, and other weapons which might not have been actually prohibited by the police ministers' agreement and which therefore were not approved for compensation under the 1996 bill. I am very pleased to commend the bill to the Main Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just listen for a moment; I will explain what my particular problem is. What we are seeing is people, and in some cases government instrumentalities, cashing in on this scheme at taxpayers' expense. In my own electorate, there is great anger after the federal government owned Australian Defence Industries factory in Lithgow surrendered 160 unwanted firearms and was paid more than $400,000. ADI has defended this decision, claiming the company is a licensed firearms dealer and is legally entitled to compensation. I have argued that this is morally wrong and goes against the spirit of the buyback scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in rural areas like Lithgow there is already some opposition to the buyback scheme. This extremely unwise decision to sell off old military style weapons has only helped generate more anger and opposition to what is a very worthwhile scheme but one that has been extremely difficult to sell to rural people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make matters worse, it has since been confirmed to me by two former executives of the ADI Lithgow small arms factory that taxpayers have now forked out twice to have those particular weapons destroyed. Both former executives have said that the majority of weapons recently surrendered under the buyback scheme were from the Korean and Vietnam wars. ADI Lithgow was contracted by the army to destroy the weapons between 1969 and 1974 but it seems they were not destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we see the struggling factory, decimated under 13 years of Labor government administration, doing everything it can to stay in business&mdash;and, unfortunately, `everything' includes double&hyphen;dipping at taxpayers' expense. What we are seeing is a buyback scheme being used to purchase weapons that should have been destroyed years ago and that were safely kept under lock and key in a factory armory. Surely ADI has the means within its walls to shred these weapons and not dip into this public purse. As a great supporter of ADI Lithgow, it pains me to have to highlight this fact, but this decision has clearly angered the people of Lithgow as I am sure it should anger the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rush to hand in weapons over the past few days under the buyback scheme has demonstrated that there are still vast numbers of firearms in homes across this country, and that many have been slow to take advantage of the amnesty. I would much rather see the amnesty extended and publicised for another month, to rid Australian homes of conventional low&hyphen;powered rifles and such, than see money spent buying antique military weapons that pose little or no threat at all. It is the presence of these low&hyphen;powered rifles that poses the greatest danger.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great legacies of the Port Arthur tragedy is that this shocking incident empowered the government of Australia to take action to restrict firearms and to ensure there are enforceable uniform laws in all states. Many misguided firearm owners still believe it is their constitutional right to bear arms. Of course, there is no such right, and with multipartisan support this government has shown that only people with a genuine need for firearms have any right to have one. The gun culture that many with vested interests try to promote has taken an enforced step backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most firearm owners I have been in contact with say they find the new laws fair and workable, and they have no problem complying. That particularly applies to farmers. In most cases it is only the absolute fanatics who are disenchanted with this law reform: people who cannot be satisfied with owning any gun, but feel they really must have one or several high&hyphen;powered deadly weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there are also those collectors who have, I believe, a legitimate concern about the loss of their hard&hyphen;won and long&hyphen;cherished weapons, handed down from grandfathers and so on. I can appreciate their appreciation of the aesthetic form of these weapons, but say to them that, at the end of the day, a gun was designed to kill something. Unless we can get the most dangerous weapons out of the system, then we will not have achieved anything in the wake of Port Arthur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are still many high&hyphen;powered deadly weapons out there that have not been handed in. According to bush folklore there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, buried underground in PVC piping. For that reason, the critics of the buyback scheme have branded it a failure, and say the deadly weapons are still out there and there is nothing to stop another Martin Bryant going on the attack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, they are wrong. In New South Wales around 150,000 automatic and semiautomatic firearms have been handed in. That is a magnificent figure, and will ensure the lives of many ordinary Australians are saved. Thankfully, the Martin Bryants of this world are extremely rare. Most people who are killed by firearms are not victims of mass shootings like Port Arthur. They are everyday mums and kids, killed in the heat of a domestic dispute, perhaps; or people caught up in the child support system at the moment&mdash;a system that I hope is finally getting some sort of reform.</PARA>

These people are struggling farmers or troubled youths on the farm, who in a moment of depression desire to take their lives, where unfortunately a firearm is easy to access and ends their life before they even have time to have a second thought. As a former rural journalist I am very familiar with the enormous curse of suicide in country Australia&mdash;as are many, many members in here, and not only rural members. I see in our midst the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), who has a true and deep appreciation of this tragedy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my former job, how many times did I do the police rounds over the years, hearing of a fatality only to be told there were no suspicious circumstances. `No suspicious circumstances' is police terminology for suicide; and traditionally, unless there is a well&hyphen;known person involved, these suicides go unreported in the media in this country. So they should, although the statistics should be highlighted and semaphored as much as we possibly can; but exploitation of the tragedy of suicide for news purposes is something that I certainly never engaged in.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8991">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a rural journalist for the best part of the last 20 years, and with rural Australia in crisis for much of that period, I am very familiar with how many of these deaths there are. They are deaths that, unlike Port Arthur, do not make the nightly news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A study published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia </EMPHASIS>in 1991 shows exactly how prevalent these non&hyphen;headline grabbing killings really are. An examination of coronial reports in the Brisbane region during the 1980s revealed 587 firearm deaths, including 76 per cent suicides, 18 per cent murders, with the remainder accidental. Of the murders where the perpetrator was identified, 71 per cent of victims were killed by someone known to them. It was often a spouse, jilted ex&hyphen;boyfriend, family member, friend or neighbour. It is an established fact that the most common perpetrators of gun violence are not criminals or crazy people. They are people otherwise known as `normal responsible gun owners' who kill either themselves and/or people close to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the gun lobby to warn of invading hordes from Indonesia, or the need to protect yourself from home invasions and the like, is nothing more than a nonsense really, born of the insecurity in our community and largely of the fact that there are so many guns out there in the first place. The buyback scheme will save lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another ridiculous argument of the gun lobby is that most people who have handed in firearms have then gone out and bought new ones. This claim has come at the same time as gun shop owners say they are going broke. Only last week the owner of Carrington Firearms in Dubbo, one of the best known dealers in western New South Wales, was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> as having sold only two guns in the last few months. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This exposes the gun lobby's lies. The fanatics cannot have it both ways. The shop owners say they are not selling firearms. This talk of people replacing old guns with new ones, I believe, is incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, I strongly support the gun buyback program, but this bill takes it all one step too far in the eyes of many people in my electorate. In some respects, it is catching up with the horse after it has bolted because I know that, as in the case of Lithgow ADI, the compensation has already been wrongly paid and wrongly directed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this amendment really directs funds that could be better used to extract other lawful weapons from the community rather than being used for this government instrumentality to top up its income&mdash;from one hand of government to the other. I realise it will be passed on the voices but, in my case, it will be with great reservation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I imagine a lot of us, as members, have had many letters from people who you could say have been part of the gun culture which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), by his leadership on this issue, has sought to dispel in the community. Unfortunately, one or two very extreme individuals in that group have written to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One individual, whom I shall name, is a Mr Stuart Willis from Samford who wrote a diatribe of letters to me over a number of months. Most of the time they were five or six pages and full of absolute balderdash and rhetoric and almost unintelligible. But in recent times, because I stood up to some of the rubbish that he was writing to me and took him on, he decided by way of payback to write an anonymous letter to the local paper in grossly defamatory terms about me. Unfortunately for him, I recognised the writing style, which was all too obvious, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8992"> and Mr Willis will be feeling the force of some responses by way of legal proceedings in due course for his efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as much as anyone else, have had a good deal of correspondence about this issue. We all know how hard it has been for the government and for some genuine members of the community. I am a gun owner myself. I live on a property and I need weapons because I have dingoes, foxes, and sick stock which need to be put down. It is necessary for me to have weapons. Therefore, I have applied for a licence. I put in my application last Friday and I hope it will be accepted. I did have a licence previously, of course. The application is for the basic weapons, not the fancy weapons; it is for a .22, a shotgun and a .303.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One aspect of the overall legislation, if I might say by way of comment, involves a leap too far. I have had a number of complaints from constituents, one of which I really have to mention to the House. This particular constituent had been bequeathed two air rifles by his grandfather. He had never so much as polished the oil off the barrels in about 30-odd years, yet he has had to hand in these rifles. It seems to me that that was one situation where the buyback scheme went too far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember the comment that was made earlier by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) about the aircraft cannons which had to be handed in. They were World War II cannons and $440,000 was paid for 22 of them. One would really wonder whether that was catching too many fish in the net, as it were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some anecdotal stories of weapons that have sat on display for many years&mdash;old cannons and old bits and pieces of machine guns and so forth&mdash;having to be pulled out of their stocks, having to be unbolted and handed in. You do tend to wonder a little bit about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I wanted to turn my attention to specifically was a particular constituent who has been hurt very badly by the events that occurred and by the subsequent legislation. His name is Mr John Peterson. He has a business in my electorate called Queensland Combined Arms Technologies and it is located at 30 Duntroon Street, Brendale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Peterson and his wife have been building up the company over a number of years. In more recent times they have achieved some success in their business by the development of certain moulds used in the manufacture of stocks for weapons. The revenue from the sale of these stocks provided a regular income to the company. It is a little business. Like so many small businesses in this country, it depends for its existence on the incredible effort and time that is put in by a husband and wife team. Also, the assets that they own are used to support and maintain the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The income generated was used over a period of time in the development of a semiautomatic weapon with a view to selling it to the Australian army as a training weapon. There was also interest from the Thai government in relation to the development of this particular weapon. The company was involved in the tender process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, after the Port Arthur massacre and the subsequent events, demand for weapons Australia&hyphen;wide dropped dramatically and the income previously generated by the sale of the synthetic stocks was reduced to a near non&hyphen;existent level. As a result, the company was forced to withdraw from the tender process, thereby denying itself the possibility of a significant profit from the sale of the weapons. The company, in effect, has been put in grave jeopardy by these measures.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8993">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question really is whether or not he can get compensation and that is a real question in this particular case. A compensation claim was subsequently made on behalf of the company to the firearms compensation division of the Queensland Police Service. Compensation was sought in respect of the moulds and related to their value, which was established by professional valuers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland Police Service wrote to my constituent through his solicitor on 25 September this year to the effect that the items of equipment contained did not fall within the parameters of stock items being compensated for under the Queensland firearms compensation scheme for licensed dealers. Items being compensated for under the scheme are broadly confined to restricted firearms and parts and accessories specific to those firearms, not equipment used in the manufacture of those items. The letter goes on to say that items used in the manufacture of firearms or firearm components are clearly included under the auspices of the loss of business program in Queensland. The operational components of this program are being managed by Price Waterhouse. The company was invited to present a case for consideration by Price Waterhouse under the loss of business compensation program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, under the claim that was made, this amounted to a letter of rejection and it was suggested that the alternative process&mdash;by loss of business compensation&mdash;should be pursued. The problem, as the company sees it, is the very restricted models for valuation of the business that have been prepared. In other words, a very narrow and restricted model for valuation has been prepared by Price Waterhouse. As I have indicated, this company is a registered dealer and, as such, it is entitled to make a claim for loss of business under the program. However, the models produced for assessment of value of business are drafted in such a way as to relate to dealers and not specifically to manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) to look into this. The company fears that the limited compensation models will prevent a fair and reasonable payment to the company in respect of its loss of business. This fear is a well grounded one, it would seem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1997  provides that the Attorney&hyphen;General may authorise the payment to a state of amounts by way of reimbursement for qualifying compensation paid by the state. It therefore seems to me, having regard to the bill, that there is an opportunity or there is a discretion perhaps that is open for the Attorney&hyphen;General to authorise the compensation payment by the state to an applicant in respect of items which were not specifically covered in the buyback program. Thus, arguably there is a possibility that this could be extended to include compensation to be paid in respect of the moulds. The company believes that the government has already made payments to others in respect of surrendered moulds. I do not have information in relation to that; that is a belief that the company instructs me about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no overstatement to say that this company is teetering on the brink. With it goes the livelihood of the people who own the business, Mr and Mrs Peterson, as well as the assets they have used to support the business in its trading position. Its trading position has suffered considerably and its somewhat buoyant and prospectively exciting role of being able to be a supplier of specific and very discrete weapons, both to the Australian Army and to Thailand, has been very much eroded and, indeed, probably eliminated by the effect of the measures that the government has introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the government, and the Attorney in particular, to look into this matter. I intend to take it up with him personally. I ask whether or not this situation can be compensated so that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8994"> Petersons' business may survive or, at the very least, that they will receive some compensation which will help them to save their home and their assets, because it is so serious that their business could well and truly go under as a result of what has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have met Mr Peterson on a number of occasions. He is a genuine and balanced individual. He has made proper and consistent representations, both to me and to a particular staff member in my office who has been dealing with this matter in a very competent way. As well, he has been acting through a solicitor whom I know personally and who is very competent. So I ask that this particular matter be given some attention to see whether or not the bill and the Attorney can provide for the exercise of a discretion to cover a person who is in this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having regard to all of the matters to which I have referred, I do support these measures. But I say to the House that there have been some unexpected and unintended consequences for some people who have been hurt as a result of their business activities prior to the tragedy and prior to the subsequent events. I ask the Attorney to bear these matters in mind in exercising his discretion ultimately in respect of this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australians have always had reasonable access to firearms, and law&hyphen;abiding citizens have always had an understandable expectation that individual ownership would continue, as indeed would the facility for them to pursue their sporting pastime. This reasonable expectation has lost ground daily. Australian firearm owners quite rightly believe the day is coming when the civilian population will be disarmed and only those who break the law will possess firearms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The uniform gun laws were ill&hyphen;conceived and rushed through without thought or consultation. Any proposed need has no basis in fact and is an affront to anyone who is even slightly informed of the facts and figures. Dr Adam Graycar, from the Australian Institute of Criminology, has stated that banning semiautomatic firearms will do nothing to prevent the majority of Australian gun deaths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I would certainly not advocate illegitimate ownership of such firearms, we cannot escape the fact that even just in the case of centre&hyphen;fire semiautomatic rifles, the majority of which are military style, there are in excess of a million such firearms in Australia, yet this style accounts for less than two per cent of Australian firearm deaths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the free access to millions of firearms in Australia, the available data shows the number of murders committed with firearms since 1979 has been in a steady downward trend, despite the rise in murders generally over the same period. It should also be acknowledged that this period of general decline covered the peak years of importation for the so&hyphen;called military style semiautomatic firearms. In fact, this period shows that an average of 92 murders, or 20 to 30 per cent of the total murders committed each year, were carried out with firearms. Many more people are murdered by other means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1990, there has been a rapid increase in murders committed with sharp instruments. These alone far outnumber murders with firearms for the same period&mdash;again, despite the vast availability of firearms. Even when looking at suicides, where there is an alarming increase in incidence, you will find a steady downward trend in the use of firearms. Available information shows that since 1979 suicides have increased nearly 45 per cent but use of a firearm to commit suicide has gone down by over 25 per cent. Since 1970, suicide with a firearm has dropped from nearly 30 per cent of all suicides to about 17 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Removing completely inoperable guns from our war museums and paying compensation in excessive amounts is probably one of the more foolish examples of this government's agenda. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8995"> The act of removing rusty, non&hyphen;working machine guns from museums is contributing to erasing our history and will not save a single life. A person in Darwin was paid nearly $&half; a million for 20&hyphen;millimetre cannons from fighter planes. Considering that the current removal of firearms from private ownership was largely targeted at centre&hyphen;fire semiautomatics, and less than two per cent, or 10 firearm&hyphen;related deaths a year are attributable to this style of firearm, is the $500 million buyback coupled with the unaccountable costs justifiable in the context of the variety of weapons used to commit murder, and the many causes of accidental deaths?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps as many as 50,000 Australians die each year through the effects of diseases caused by alcohol and tobacco. What impact would the $500 million have had in reducing these horrendous figures. Each year, countless thousands die in road accidents and in all manner of other activities, yet are we to believe that these and the deaths from alcohol and tobacco are somehow more acceptable because so many people drink and smoke and drive? There are millions of firearms and firearms owners, but despite the vast numbers and the amount of use, in context, the number of deaths is relatively low, and the government's approach cannot be justified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bear in mind that removing firearms from law&hyphen;abiding citizens will most likely impact only upon accidents, and in this case, there are only about 15 fatalities each year. One thousand people die each year from accidental falls, and 250 drown. There was no gun debate, as such. There was no consultation or concern for the facts, merely misinformation shoved down the throats of an understandably emotional public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This has been a political exercise, pure and simple, with no reduction in the amount of firearms in society. In fact, quite the contrary has occurred, as the figures show. For every firearm turned in, approximately 1.7 modern firearms have been purchased with the compensation. There is also the issue of the number of firearms that have literally gone underground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The returns do not begin to count for the estimated number of firearms. In particular, hundreds of thousands of military style semiautomatics would seem to be missing. It is time we acknowledge that crime is caused by economic desperation and helplessness, unemployment, loss of hope, family breakdown, substance abuse, and cultural conflicts&mdash;not by firearms ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Swiss experience is, perhaps, the best example. In Switzerland, there are more firearms and fewer deaths than in Australia. The majority of firearms in that country are military weapons&mdash;millions of them. It is only when we, as one nation, address these issues together that crime will reduce. Violence and crime are not proportional to the availability of firearms; they are directly linked to the security and decency of our society. Governments that pretend otherwise are looking to hide the true causes of the situation and escape the responsibility for addressing the real issues and, therefore, they perpetrate a lie on their people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Saving lives, or reducing crime, was obviously not behind the government's attacks on the private ownership of firearms. Indeed, they are guilty of the crime of using an emotional period for political purposes. Have no doubt, the buyback has failed. There are now more firearms out there than before, and many are modern and potentially more deadly than the firearms they replaced. It seems that most Australians have not handed in their firearms, and be assured, absolutely no criminals have complied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the government intend to do with the millions of Australians who have not complied? Will Australia become a police state with homes systematically raided and property 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8996"> confiscated? Will the government harass, fine and gaol otherwise innocent law&hyphen;abiding Australians. History has shown that only the worst kind of government disarms its people. I stand by my belief that Australians have the right to defend themselves and their families in their own homes. Shooting is a legitimate sport and pastime, and participants should be treated accordingly. Disarming law&hyphen;abiding Australians is not in the national interest and will do nothing to reduce crime. An honest government would take heed, so we can be sure this one is not listening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simply put, it should be remembered that, during the last election campaign, the current government used the slogan: `enough is enough'. Be assured that the firearm owners of Australia are tired of unwarranted and unjustified interference. They are tired of being used as political scapegoats and of being the victims of United Nations treaties. You can be assured that Australia's firearm owners have adopted the Liberal&hyphen;National coalition slogan because that is exactly how they feel, that enough is enough. Always remember, outlaw firearms and only outlaws will have them.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate, and I want to do so by picking up some of the remarks made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), who preceded me in the debate. In reflections on the question of gun ownership in Australia that did not surprise any one of us, the member for Oxley implied not only that the scheme has been a failure, but that it was the intention of the government to disarm Australia with the legislation that followed the Port Arthur massacre, and that that intention has failed because Australians have successfully rearmed; so the scheme has been a failure, and there are more weapons in Australia than there were prior to the legislation being introduced. That was the first of her themes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second of her themes was that effectively, since alcohol, tobacco, cars and sharp instruments killed more people than guns, the government in some way had been inconsistent in applying this gun legislation and not legislating effectively, in her view, against the carnage caused by alcohol, tobacco and road accidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you, this chamber and the member for Oxley that it was not the intention of the government to disarm Australia. The legislation that was introduced following the horrific Port Arthur massacre was introduced because the federal government recognised the responsibility that it and every Australian government had to ensure that the innocent would be adequately protected.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8997">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the intent of the federal government had been to disarm Australia, Australia would have been disarmed. But as a member for a rural electorate, with the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) sitting here on my left, let me hasten to reassure everybody that neither I nor anyone that I am aware of within the coalition&mdash;and, I would suspect, no&hyphen;one in the opposition either&mdash;sought at any stage to disarm Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the rumours about disarming Australia were running so rife I was one who said to the Attorney&hyphen;General, `I hope you are not intending by some sort of underhand method to disarm Australia, because I am not going through all of this agony again if this is only step 1.' Of course, that was not his intent. It was not the intent of the government, nor was it the intent of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What effectively has happened, counter to the general theme of the speech of the member for Oxley, is that in Australia today we probably have very nearly as many weapons as we had prior to the Port Arthur massacre. That does not cause me any alarm. As far as I know, it does not cause the Attorney&hyphen;General any alarm. He will have an opportunity to respond in just a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have succeeded in doing is removing a large proportion of what were the most antisocial weapons out of the community and replacing them with those that are legal. I am not bothered that people who surrendered firearms and were compensated have used that compensation money in many instances to acquire another firearm. That does not bother me at all. I expected that to happen. The firearm they have acquired, however, is not as antisocial as was the firearm they surrendered and it is a firearm that, by the very nature of the acquisition under this legislation, will now be both licensed and recorded so that the law enforcement agencies know where that weapon is and in whose hands it is held. That is a dramatic step forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just absurd to draw any sort of analogy between the firearm legislation and the other difficulties that we have in common with every other society as a result of drugs or alcohol or cigarettes or even knives. No&hyphen;one is proposing that the government, for example, should legislate against knives so that we cannot consume meals except with forks. Even a fork in the wrong hand could be seen to be lethal in one form or another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the government has not ignored, as the member for Oxley would suggest, the antisocial implications of alcohol, drugs and tobacco. Quite on the contrary! Both sides of the parliament have been quite adventurous in the way that they have dealt with ensuring that the laws across Australia for drugs somehow are enforceable from state to state and ensuring that road tragedy laws become increasingly reinforced from a common perspective. What has been done with the legislation that was introduced following the Port Arthur massacre is simply that we now have a situation where uniform laws apply across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I participate in this debate as a South Australian, as someone from a state whose gun laws were seen to be relatively effective. But even in South Australia, the management is dramatically enhanced of weapons that no&hyphen;one&mdash;not even the member for Oxley&mdash;would want in Australia and weapons that ought to have been illegal across the entire nation because of their military characteristics. Whereas, prior to the Attorney&hyphen;General's action, any South Australian could have a neighbouring land&hyphen;holder across the border store those weapons for them, in October 1997 we are in a situation where wherever you place that weapon it is illegal unless licensed. The full force of the law will be brought against you if you are found to be in possession of it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8998">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a dramatic step forward&mdash;a step that not just the government but the parliament and the Attorney&hyphen;General ought to be commended for as well. It is simply nonsense to paint a picture of legislation seeking to disarm Australia. It is simply nonsense to run some sort of conspiracy theory that suggests that somehow we are going to leave the citizens of Australia more vulnerable to attack as a result of this legislation. It is nonsense because the citizens of Australia remain in a position where they have access to legal firearms as they need them and nonsense because there is no sense in which one can expect to be defending the nation sitting in your front lounge poking an automatic weapon through the window at someone who is or would be an intruder. If Australia is genuinely under attack, its defence will come clearly from the full force of the military. Any other form of defence is nothing more than offensive in terms of keeping a cohesive and effective society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation before the House deals, of course, with much more than the events that have followed the Port Arthur massacre. It has been a necessary amendment brought in by the Attorney&hyphen;General because of action in the Northern Territory where the acquisition of 22 aircraft cannon warranted some additional compensation beyond the act and hence this legislation. This has been brought in with the support of both the government and the opposition, recognising that this amendment allows us to complete what was part of the firearm buyback in Australia, that it covers an anomaly that had arisen in the Northern Territory, and that it is part of a scheme that has allowed us to take over 600,000 firearms out of the community at the cost of not quite $300 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By any measure, Australia is a safer country because of the action taken by the government and the opposition and by the vigorous actions of Attorney&hyphen;General following the Port Arthur massacre. No-one pretends that risk has suddenly been eliminated from Australia, but one of the risks, the mowing down of innocent people as occurred at Port Arthur, has been dramatically reduced through this legislation. Not to have done what we have done would have been an act of gross negligence on the part of the parliament. Parliamentarians should be proud of the action that they have taken in the face of some community hostility. It was action that was taken courageously, recognising that it is in the community interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the representative of a rural electorate, there is one other issue that I must address before I sit down, and it is this. It is absurd to suggest that farmers have in some way been disadvantaged by the legislation that was introduced following the Port Arthur massacre. In fact, access to bolt action weapons is still readily available to any farmer at any time, and exemptions are in place so that where an appropriate automatic weapon is needed then farmers can acquire it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no cause for concern on the part of the rural community. There is no cause for concern on the part of those who have a sporting interest in firearms because as a result of being a recognised member of an appropriate firearm club, they too can have access to the weapons they need to participate in various sporting events. Anyone with a legitimate need for a weapon that is seen to be not of the antisocial group that the original legislation was designed to prohibit still has access to those weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to be a part of a government that has acted courageously not to trim the rights of Australians, and to ensure that innocent Australians are protected from the sort of horror that we witnessed at Port Arthur. I recognise that this legislation is a step towards ensuring that an anomaly that occurred in the Northern Territory can also be addressed as part of the guns buyback scheme.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to speak today on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R308">National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1997</XREF> . The greatest reason for the nationwide guns buyback scheme was the tragedy at Port Arthur in Tasmania on 28 April 1996. There is a lot of debate saying that this government or this parliament has disarmed the country. However, debate on this guns issue has been in the community for many years. As far as the whole issue is concerned, I congratulate both sides of the House because of the fact that people were prepared to work in a bipartisan way to ensure that this country's future is well protected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirty&hyphen;five people were killed and many people were wounded when Martin Bryant used his high&hyphen;powered semiautomatic weapon. As a result of this tragedy, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) immediately announced that the Commonwealth government would buy back all military style self&hyphen;loading rifles, pump action shotguns and other semiautomatic weapons. People have not only handed in all those different types of weapons, but we have also seen submachine guns and, of course, World War II aircraft cannons as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The guns buyback scheme has been a great success, with more than 600,000 firearms being handed in for destruction and compensation. To say that the parliament wanted to disarm the country is crazy. Australians can still own firearms. I have heard people in the debate today say that it was not a great success. People have to understand that the government was only chasing a particular style or set of weapons. It is as simple as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to own a gun, you can still own a gun. It is as simple as that. Whether it is for sporting or for feral animal eradication on your property&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;if you want to own a firearm and it is within the legal category, you can still have it. If, on the other side of the fence, you want something that is in the illegal category and you have a legitimate reason and you can support that, once again, you can have that weapon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am concerned, this will make Australia a safer place to live. Of course, there are still many guns out there in the community; there may be some illegal ones as well. There are a lot less of them than there were before and I consider that to be a good thing. I have spoken to a lot of people in the community&mdash;and I will keep using this word `emotion'&mdash;and now that the emotion has been removed from the debate somewhat, people are starting to say, `Well, gee, this isn't such a bad thing after all.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I still get faxes and letters from some people, including constituents in my electorate who believe the gun buyback scheme has not worked and there are still thousands of illegal guns in the community. I hope this is not right. I have attended many gun rallies since the inception of the gun debate. I have attended both sides of the argument. I understand the pain and the passion of many people over this issue. Most gun owners are decent, responsible people and the majority of Australians will agree that change had to happen, especially in relation to a prohibited persons register. At the end of the day, if somebody is not of sound mind and they should not have a firearm, then that should be exactly the case. They should not have a firearm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole issue has caused a lot of angst in the community. Fair enough, this is a democratic society. We should all have the right to express ourselves. There are some out there in the community who have tried to use the debate for their self-gain and self&hyphen;promotion. I consider it is terrible that people are prepared to use this debate for their own devices. I ask people to look very closely at those who try to use it for their own self-gain. Make sure you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9000"> look and go all the way into the debate, because, once again, the emotion of the issue is what has caused a lot of the heartache.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I handed my own gun in the other day and I received a considerable amount of compensation. I do not mind saying that I only paid $300 for my semiautomatic shotgun and I received $730 compensation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there were to be change at the eleventh hour, maybe I would have liked to have seen people who have applied for licences in relation to illegal weapons before 30 September and have been knocked back and had to hand their gun in still get compensation. We never know where that may end up somewhere in the future. Maybe there are opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the whole I was not excited about handing my gun in. But once you take the emotion out of the debate and sit down and accept that this is now the law and it must be adhered to, it is simple as that. Basically as far as guns are concerned, I still have my 243 bolt action rifle. It is licensed. I am allowed to have it. It is as simple as that. I say to one and all&mdash;the people out in the community&mdash;this was not all about disarming Australia, takeover bids from other countries and this world order and so forth. If you want to own a gun and you can verify that you fall into the correct category, you can still have a gun. We had to remove those weapons that can cause mass destruction and were not acceptable in today's society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other side of it, we see our gun clubs. Gun clubs have prospered from this. I think it is a great initiative. We can have community policing in society. Some people may not be able to have a weapon or a rifle, owing to the fact they do not have large amounts of land to shoot on. Now they have to be a member of a club. People will now see them mixing in society, with their rifles, when they go to sporting shoots. Now you can actually police people to see whether they are worthy to have that rifle. This form of community policing is very acceptable; it has gone a long way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am concerned, at the end of the day, the legislation has gone through. There was a lot of hype and emotion at the start of the debate, but now that it is drawing to a close I certainly believe that people are starting to accept the legislation. As I said, if you want to own a gun, you can still have one.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R308">National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1997</XREF>  complements the National Firearms Program Implementation Act 1996. The thrust of this bill is to ensure that the Commonwealth can reimburse the states and territories for compensation paid for historically prohibited firearms or other weapons. It will provide the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) with the authority to certify that the surrender of certain firearms or other weapons is consistent with the spirit of the national program and it will allow the Attorney&hyphen;General to authorise that the states and territories be reimbursed for the compensation paid for such firearms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9001">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the Attorney&hyphen;General has put a lot of effort into implementing the whole firearms buyback scheme in a very fair and balanced way. It is important that what we see is that the government, led very ably by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and strongly supported by the Attorney&hyphen;General and the states&mdash;and, I must also acknowledge, by the opposition&mdash;has put in place what, in general terms, has been something very beneficial for Australia. I also have to support the comments of my colleague and good friend the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) when he pointed out the nonsense of some of the things that were being said by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), particularly any suggestion that this move by the government is in some way to try to disarm the civilian population of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to speak to this bill as someone who has had a keen interest in firearms ownership for many years. I have, in fact, held a licence for 30 years. I have been a member of the Field and Game Association for more than 25 years. I was honoured to be asked by the Prime Minister to chair the Firearms Consultative Committee, which looked at certain details of the implementation of the firearms buyback scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we should always recognise the dual expectations of the community. There is no doubt that the Australian community was absolutely rocked by the tragedy of Port Arthur. I think the Australian community was extremely impressed by the decisive leadership that the Prime Minister showed following that tragedy, and he was strongly supported, right across the political landscape. What the Prime Minister set out to do was to remove undesirable firearms from the community and, as well as that, to ensure that Australia did adopt uniform laws. The other aspect was to give much greater recognition to the need for a responsible approach to firearm ownership. On that point, those who have demonstrated a responsible approach should be able to continue to have that ownership and to pursue the use of the firearms in a responsible and legitimate way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we saw the drama of Port Arthur, it raised a very real community fear. It certainly was a terrible tragedy. But what it did do with the vast majority of firearms owners, who are responsible people, was to cast a question mark over them as to why they should continue to own firearms. Yet when you look at the safety record of the vast majority, when you look in particular at the safety record of gun clubs, I think they can demonstrate that they have in fact carried on their sport in a very responsible manner. At the same time, we should continue to recognise that legitimate shooting is a sport that is pursued not only within Australia but internationally. Australia was very well served by three medallists at the recent Olympic Games. There were two gold medals&mdash;one to Russell Mark and one to Michael Diamond&mdash;and a bronze to Desiree Huddleston. All of them achieved the pinnacle of their sport and did it in a way that made Australia proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a very strong and legitimate reason for farmers to continue to have firearms, particularly in dealing with vermin such as foxes, pigs, rabbits, but also, at times, to deal with an odd animal that gets deranged, shall we say. I have had an occasion myself to go and borrow a neighbour's .303 to get rid of a bull that had flipped its lid and was totally uncontrollable. It was the only way we could deal with it. It did not matter what other method we tried, the only humane way to get rid of it was to shoot it with a .303. That is always going to be a problem. I think that all of us are aware of occasions when cattle have lost control and caused the death of individual farmers, and farmers are going to continue to need that last resort&mdash;which is all it is; but access to that last resort, nonetheless.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9002">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to talk a bit about the tightening of the laws. While I certainly endorse what has been done, and I certainly agree with the move for uniformity, I think that it highlights also the importance of safe storage of firearms. We have heard a number of speakers already talk about the need to see firearms probably stored in a locked cabinet, or whatever, depending on the type of firearm. We have also seen, as has been mentioned, the growth in clubs which encourage the safe and responsible use of firearms. But the concern I have is that, notwithstanding the move to uniformity, there has not been a uniformity in the administering of some of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Victoria we have had a situation where the state government has not administered these laws in quite the same way as other states. I will just give you a quote from a constituent of mine who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a policeman with twenty years experience. I am a trained firearms instructor with the Victorian Policeforce . . . I have 36 years involvement with firearms&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We now have a system which creates confusion, frustration and inexcusable delays&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And he goes on to outline some of the frustrations that he feels as someone who has been a responsible gun owner and enforcer of the law. He is certainly&mdash;and I have spoken to him&mdash;far from happy with the way that the laws are being administered. There are many examples which I will not go into in the time available, but we could elaborate at another time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that does concern me in the follow&hyphen;up to what has happened is that, while it is true that we have now seen over 600,000 firearms surrendered, the surrender rate seems to vary quite a lot between states. When we look at the official numbers that have been very kindly released by the Attorney&hyphen;General today, and we compare the ratio of the number of firearms surrendered with the number of registered voters, we find that the rate does vary quite considerably. For example, in Tasmania, the rate is 9&half; per cent of the number of firearms compared with the number of registered voters. In the Northern Territory it is similar&mdash;9.3 per cent. Then it drops in Victoria to 6.9 per cent, and down further in Queensland to 5.9 per cent. Then we go to Western Australia, 4.3 per cent; South Australia, 5.2 per cent; New South Wales, 3.6 per cent, and the ACT, 2.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I wanted to highlight from that is that there is quite a big difference between the highest rate of handing in and the lowest rate of handing in, particularly when we look at states like New South Wales. The concern I raise is that I find it difficult to believe that the ownership of guns varies so significantly between the states. It raises very serious questions as to whether states, such as Victoria and South Australia, and the others that have had high rates of hand in, where there has been firearm registration for some years, have had a higher rate of handing in than has occurred in those states that have not had firearms registration up until now. I believe that this is a matter that the Attorney&hyphen;General would probably like to take up again with the police ministers, and I will come back to that in a minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that has come through very loudly and clearly is that gun ownership is very much a regional issue. By that I mean that people living in country areas have a much higher rate of gun ownership than those living in the city, and probably for very understandable reasons. I do get rather sick of the anti&hyphen;gun lobby, most of whom seem to sit smugly in city citadels such as universities. They go on with their unctuous branding of all firearm owners as inferior citizens. They go even further sometimes and suggest that they must have some sort of personalty deficiencies. Given the background of many of these critics, their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9003"> unprofessional and distorted outbursts seem to be far more directed at personal publicity than seeking a balanced public debate or trying to get a responsible approach to this whole serious and complicated issue. I could give you some quotes, but I have not got them here with me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people in the country not only have a legitimate reason to own firearms but also, in many cases, they work in an area where they need them as a tool of trade, as is the case with farmers. As I have said, in the country areas in particular and in some urban areas, there are gun clubs. These clubs have an impeccable safety record. This should not be overlooked. We should respect those who want to get involved without maligning them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that there are schools in country Australia&mdash;I know of them in country Victoria&mdash;that are willing to train students in firearm safety because they recognise the need for this training and safety. They recognise that legitimate firearm ownership is quite frequent in country areas and that they have a role in teaching that safety. In my own electorate, the finals of the schools clay-trap shooting attracts around 200 student shooters each year. I add that there are not only boys but also females presenting at those finals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking towards the future, it is important to continue to emphasise that ownership should be limited to those who are responsible. That is something that the Attorney&hyphen;General has emphasised. At the same time, we should recognise that ownership of legitimate firearms is a pursuit that should be allowed to continue. We should also recognise that firearms are a tool of trade for some people whether they are farmers or people involved in controlling vermin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to develop a confidence in the community so that, if we do have a proper licensing system and a responsible approach, community safety can be enhanced. I think that is equally important. At the same time, those who do have a legitimate reason to own a firearm should know that, if they are prepared to comply with the law and to behave in a responsible manner, they are not going to feel as though they are being treated like second&hyphen;class citizens. We should recognise the fact that we have Olympians who are as good as anyone in the world and who have demonstrated that. I see no reason why we should not encourage people to be involved in that sport, just like all the other athletes that we proudly send to the Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do see the need for another aspect in this whole issue. With our achievements to date, and with the end of the buyback scheme yesterday, a lot of public confidence has been built up in safety. Nonetheless, this is an ongoing issue. I urge the Attorney&hyphen;General to set up consultative committees not only in each state but also with some national focus. I believe that those committees should have some real teeth for the ongoing work needed to encourage the safe and responsible ownership of firearms. The need does extend to ensure that the community is properly informed about what these committees could do and that community expectations are properly met so that legitimate and responsible firearm owners can be confident that they will not be the scapegoats for any future occurrence or tragedy. The tragedy at Port Arthur was clearly not done by the majority and the majority felt just as sick about what had happened there as all other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend again the Attorney&hyphen;General. What has been done will help to add to safety, not just because of the reduction in firearms but, equally importantly, because the campaign is helping to shape community attitudes. There is now an expectation&mdash;I believe a very strong expectation&mdash;that anyone who wants to continue to have the right to own a firearm will be granted that right only on the basis that they demonstrate that they are going to be responsible and that they have a genuine need.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9004">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that basis, what has been achieved is something of truly national significance. I hope that through the use of consultative committees we can ensure that governments, both at the state and federal levels, are able to continue to meet the varied demands of the communities, particularly the different demands that often occur between regional areas and city areas, so that we have a more informed community and, most importantly, a safer community where we can all live.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I came into this place not expecting to speak, until I received a letter this morning and I could not let the opportunity pass&mdash;I will come back to that in a moment. At the outset, in relation to the National Firearms Program Implementation Bill, I want to commend first of all, at the highest level, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The Prime Minister's leadership on this issue has been fundamental to what has happened right across the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to commend the premiers and chief ministers, who had the responsibility in this area for implementing what was an absolutely essential move to reduce the risk factor across the country. The federal Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) is here with us this morning, and I want to take the opportunity to commend him for what he has done, under some trying circumstances, to put this piece of legislation through and to implement it. Daryl Williams, as the Attorney, has been accused by some of being some sort of left&hyphen;wing internationalist who wants to brutally disarm this country. He is not, and this legislation&mdash;and indeed the measures taken right around the country by state and territory governments&mdash;is, of course, a reflection of a community mood, and that community mood is overwhelmingly in favour of what has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard people talk about brutal disarming, about Indonesians coming over the hill, about all this rubbishy stuff which I totally reject. What the Attorney has been able to inject into the whole debate is the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of reasonable firearm owners around this country, and we should commend them for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this legislation, and state legislation, injects into the equation a genuine need and genuine reason and the fundamental issue of registration and licensing that no reasonable Australian should argue against. But there are a number, I have to say, of unreasonable Australians who want to push their strong minority views on this and on other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the letter which I received this morning in my electorate office and which has just been faxed down to me. It is headed `Treason Trials' and, in part, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been instructed to advise you sir, that your name is in the eight batch of one hundred (100) alleged political, judicial, administrative, media and financial criminals to be charged, tried, and where found guilty, HUNG for treason, crimes against the constitution, crimes against the Bill of Rights 1688., etc., and crimes against humanity et. al.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you would be, or should be well aware by now, this will be your last term in office. After that the Treason Trials.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, can I just say to you that this is reflective of some of the looney tunes and minority groups that have taken over the whole debate in terms of firearm reforms. I speak of the Dorings, the McNivens, the Pitts and, indeed&mdash;I will get it into the record&mdash;Norm Segal of Nambour in Queensland. He is not even in my electorate, but I have had some correspondence from him, as a number of my colleagues have.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9005">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time we exposed these people for exactly what they are. They are not interested in responsible gun ownership; all they want is to generate some American militia concept, fundamental to which is the right to own and bear firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To go back to the Bill of Rights 1688, I went along in May of last year, before the legislation had even been developed in Queensland, to a meeting of 800 or 900 people in the City Golf Club in Toowoomba. I found 899&half; of them were against me. Why were they against me? Because they were being given all the wrong ideological rubbish. They thought that I would take a very rednecked line in this, but I did not, because what has been done is right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make the point this morning that we should expose some of these people. The Attorney&hyphen;General is well aware of the publication that goes around called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, Stock and Barrel</EMPHASIS>. It is ridiculous stuff. It incites people, and what concerns me is that the One Nation is associated, and the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) appears in that particular publication as some paragon of virtue: a paragon of virtue who wants to bring back AR15s&mdash;automatic weapons. I think people have to understand that Australia First, Australia Reform and One Nation have behind the scenes people like Mr Segal, who want to inject their extremist rubbish into our community. I hope that this morning the Attorney will have something to say on this. I repeat, we should expose them for what they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, I am sure I am going to get criticised by some of them for what I am saying this morning. I really do not care; I think I represent the vast majority of Australians. If some of these people want to go to the ballot box and vote against me, that is their democratic right, but I stand up here this morning and I am sure that I stand up on behalf of the vast majority of Australians who say that responsibility in firearm ownership is absolutely essential in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sorry I took a little longer than I meant to, but I wanted to inject the point onto the record this morning and to make it very clear that there are some people out there who want to take over the agenda. We should inject a balance back into the debate and reject them for what they are: a bunch of looney tunes and fringe dwellers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;This bill is in the nature of a tidying&hyphen;up bill. It is a bill that has not attracted a great deal of attention in the debate, which seems to be a common feature of debates in the Main Committee, but it is significant nevertheless. It will enable compensation to be paid for firearms that do not fit within the description of the firearms to be surrendered under the 1996 legislation because they were of a more dangerous type&mdash;even more dangerous than the automatic military rifles that were one of the real causes of the buyback scheme. They include submachine guns and heavy machine guns, and they had been identified and handed in in a variety of jurisdictions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The buyback scheme, which resulted from the police ministers meeting of 10 May 1996 and subsequent meetings, for the surrender of firearms for compensation, concluded yesterday. It is very pleasing to be able to report that, as of 10 o'clock this morning&mdash;that is, soon after the closing of the scheme at midnight&mdash;623,632 firearms had been surrendered and compensation to an amount of $296,874,323 had been paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those figures will, no doubt, change somewhat. There will be a number of firearms surrendered in respect of which applications for licences have also been made but not yet dealt with. Those firearms may then be returned when a licence is granted. In respect of others, compensation may be payable if the licence is not granted.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In drawing attention to the success of the buyback, I mention that there was a debate in the House of Representatives last night on a matter of public importance. I made then most of the points that I would wish to make in respect of the conclusion of the buyback. The other speakers included the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) and the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson). The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) also spoke, but took a rather different point of view which I would not commend to the House. The bill we have before us has generated little controversy. I will not comment, except in respect of a comment made by the member for Calare (Mr Andren), which I will come to in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank members for their contributions. I thank the member for Reid, the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), the member for Calare, the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and the member for Groom (Mr Taylor). You will have noted I did not mention the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), whose comments I will have something to say about in a minute. I think her contribution was regrettable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Reid raised the question of provision of information on monitoring adherence to the requirements. A number of issues arise in respect of the termination of the buyback scheme, and these will be dealt with in police ministers meetings, the next one of which will be held in November. I will certainly be writing to my state and territory counterparts as police ministers, asking them to report on their monitoring of the uniform registration and licensing system. In due course there will be a full analysis and an audit of the scheme. I have requested them also to write reporting on the implementation of the buyback, with a view to identifying any injustices that may have occurred in the administration of the scheme that could be remedied relatively quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Reid also raised a question of the government adhering to the promise about repaying surplus funds in the Medicare special levy. The question of whether there are going to be moneys left over is an open one at this point. We know how much money has been paid out in compensation; we know that $63 million has been paid out to states and territories and on other administrative arrangements in relation to the buyback scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we do not have yet is a final figure on the firearms compensation and we are very far from a final figure on the compensation to be paid to firearms dealers. The exercise there is rather more elaborate than in assessing compensation for the particular firearms because what needs to be identified is the loss in value of the business or, if the business closes, the value of the business that has terminated. It will take some months to ascertain the appropriate figures and make the appropriate payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) stands that any surplus funds will be returned to taxpayers through the Medicare levy system. I apprehend that, if the amount of money that remains is relatively small, the community might have an expectation that it would be devoted to an appropriate measure rather than chewed up in administration on the return of the modest amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calare raised an issue that pertains to his electorate. He indicated there was some anger about Australian Defence Industries Ltd surrendering stock under the buyback scheme and acquiring payment. This is not an issue that arises under the bill under consideration. What was done was lawful under the 1996 act. He can be assured that because ADI is wholly Commonwealth owned, it does amount, in effect, to a transfer of Commonwealth moneys to a Commonwealth entity and therefore gives rise to little concern.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9007">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calare also&mdash;and he was the only one&mdash;expressed some reservations about the particular bill while supporting the general buyback scheme. His suggestion was that the money could be better spent by a commitment to recovering other prohibited firearms. I do not think what he is suggesting is necessary at this juncture. We have yet to assess the level of success of the buyback scheme. No doubt if there are steps that need to be taken as a result of the assessment, these will be taken by agreement among police ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill complements the 1996 act, as noted by the member for Fisher. The old&hyphen;style military weapons&mdash;and I use the word `weapons' advisedly; they are weapons, not firearms&mdash;were not in the minds of the police ministers following the tragedy at Port Arthur. We did not have in mind that there would be in the community bazookas, aircraft cannon, Bofors cannon and the like, which subsequently, it turned out, there were. The surrender of historically prohibited weapons for fair and proper compensation is certainly within the spirit of the national program and this bill would allow for it to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dickson raised concerns about the adequacy of the compensation arrangements. That is not an issue that arises in relation to this bill, but the buyback scheme was administered by the different states and territories. They had different arrangements pertaining&mdash;some started earlier than others. It is evident that in each jurisdiction there were some difficulties, at least at the outset, in establishing what was the most efficient scheme. Most of those difficulties were resolved as time went by, although there was, no doubt, considerable pressure, especially in Queensland, in meeting the target within the time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wakefield followed the member for Oxley and addressed some of her remarks, as I will do also. He pointed out that the government did not seek to disarm Australia, as she had asserted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley indicated that the day is coming when the civilian population will be disarmed. That statement is totally wrong. The government has no intention of going down that path, nor to my knowledge does any other government or any opposition in the country. It is not only wrong, it is inflammatory, dangerous and irresponsible. I commend the members who spoke subsequently and indicated their rejection of that particular view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley seems to think that the only people who will be left with firearms will be criminals. I cannot imagine where on earth that conclusion could be derived from. The uniform laws contemplate that there will be valid uses of firearms and valid purposes for holding them. That is the nub of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is recognition that there are genuine reasons for holding firearms of whatever category. It recognises that there are, in some cases, genuine needs for having the more dangerous category C and D firearms. That is part of the scheme and it is not intended to change it. The member for Wannon, among others, mentioned the particular uses as tools of trade to which some firearms are put and mention was also made of recreational use under very strict conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley suggested that violence and crime are not proportional to the availability of firearms. The point I would make in response to that is that she seems to have no research to back that up. I question the assumption. But what is evident from the research is that the availability of firearms is related to the number of deaths and injuries resulting from firearms. In Australia we have between 400 and 500 deaths from firearms, the bulk of which&mdash;80 per cent approximately&mdash;are suicides. The relationship between the availability of firearms and the suicide rate in a particular community is direct. By removing more than 600,000 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9008"> firearms we may, and I hope we have, set in train a reduction in the death rate and the injury rate from firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley asserted that the vast majority of Australians have not handed in their firearms and again mentioned that criminals, one should be assured, have not. The member for Oxley is talking through her hat. The research conducted by the government, about which I spoke in the MPI in the house yesterday at some length, indicates that there is very strong support for the uniform laws. What was indicated with that was that, nationwide, there is very strong compliance and intention to comply. The vast majority of Australians about whom the member for Oxley speaks in fact support the laws and the vast majority have complied with the laws. Again, what she says is inflammatory, dangerous and irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wakefield spoke as a user of a firearm and I think the attitude that he evinced towards the use of firearms is a healthy and an appropriate one. The member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) raised particularly the question of those who had surrendered firearms by 30 September, but whose licence applications had not been dealt with. That is a particular situation which has been addressed already, but we will closely monitor that situation and the reports from the various jurisdictions in order to ensure that there has been no injustice in the closing off of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wannon, whom I commend as the chairman of the consultative committee, who assisted the government in the formulation of the proposals, is a very experienced firearms owner, as his speech indicated. He highlighted a number of the features of the current scheme, I think appropriately. The safety record of firearms owners, and in particular those who participate in clubs, is well&hyphen;known and the responsible attitude evinced by those people is a matter of record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He questioned the administration, giving an example of delays referred to by a constituent in Victoria. I am not able to respond directly to that, but I did indicate earlier that the administrations in the different jurisdictions did take time to settle down. That is certainly forgivable because the governments were doing something that had never been done before and, in some cases, they were setting up registration and licensing systems that did not exist in any form prior to the commencement of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wannon has calculated the ratio of firearms handed in to population, and gave some interesting statistics. He queried whether the ownership of firearms does vary that much. It seems in fact that it does. I have been advised that New South Wales, for example, has a third of Australia's population but only one-fifth of the firearms, and that may account for the relatively low percentage figure that the member for Wannon referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Tasmania and Queensland there were relatively few, if any, rules relating to the ownership of firearms. That may account for the very high percentage in Tasmania, where there was no registration system at all. In the Northern Territory, I would suggest, it is much more likely that people would own firearms than they would in the southern states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Victoria seems to have a different culture from other places. There has been a high ownership of shotguns in that state, particularly in the rural and regional areas, although, notably, there was a higher number of firearms handed in in metropolitan centres than there were in Victorian rural and regional centres. Western Australia and South Australia have had strict licensing schemes for some time and strict ownership rules, which may account for why their percentages are relatively low. However, analysis would provide better information, and I hope that will be done.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9009">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wannon mentioned the question of training in schools. One of the features of the uniform scheme was the development of training packages for new firearms owners. What is occurring in schools, which I had not heard about before, sounds very good. He also made particular mention about consultative committees. He suggested that there will be a need for ongoing work in relation to the safe and responsible ownership of firearms and a need to ensure that community expectations and safety expectations are met. This is an idea that I think should be taken up and examined and I propose to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Groom referred to some extremist views that had been expressed to him in a letter. That letter is one that I think should be referred to appropriate authorities. Those sorts of letters should not be received by anybody, particularly a public figure, from somebody who is simply making threats. He referred to some of the extremist views that had been expressed by a number of people. I reject them in the same way that he does. I think all right thinking people in Australia would reject the notion that firearms should be owned in order that there can be militia groups established who will conduct their own treason trials, as he pointed out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That concludes the comments I wish to make on those who spoke. I commend the bill to the House and thank the opposition for its support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very straightforward piece of legislation which does one thing only, namely, extend the life of the National Road Transport Commission by a year, on the basis that it is necessary to allow time for further discussions between the federal government and the states with respect to the future role that the NRTC will play and what future framework may be involved with developing that role. The opposition supports the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting in the brief comments that I will make that this is probably the sole substantial area of bipartisanship between myself and the former Minister for Transport, Mr Sharp, and I would commend both him and the government for continuing the work that was initiated by the former government with respect to regulation of road transport activities and the National Road Transport Commission, and providing the support and assistance necessary to pursue that work. As I have said, it is probably the only area of substantive agreement in the major policy areas so it must have something going for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work of the NRTC has involved gradually developing, in consultation with the states&mdash;and, of course, relevant stakeholders, such as the industry and the Transport Workers Union, users and various parties&mdash;a structure of uniform national rules with respect to road transport. Of course, that covers a very wide variety of issues&mdash;not just things like uniform charging 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9010"> and registration issues but, also, driver hours, safety and mass limits. There are a long list of issues that have to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend John Hurlstone, David O'Sullivan and the commission on the work that they have done to date. It is a remarkable tribute to them that they have managed to achieve so much and that that has been done in spite of the constraints of our antiquated federal system which means that it is impossible to do anything in these areas without getting agreement from a very wide range of players, many of whom have a variety of different agendas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also very pleasing to see the NRTC pursuing a range of innovative agendas on a number of issues. I was particularly pleased to see that the question of penalties for drivers breaching regulations with respect to safety, driving hours, and the like, has been addressed by the commission, and that the question of company owners, or prime contractors, being held liable for breaches perpetrated by their drivers has actually been raised by the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the critical issues in Australian transport policy and, indeed, public life generally at the moment is the way that drivers in the road transport industry are forced by employers, contractors, users and circumstances associated with the needs of the users to work ridiculously long hours in grossly unsafe circumstances which threaten the lives and the wellbeing, not only of the drivers, but also of other users of public roads. We are all very conscious of some of the tragedies that have occurred over the past five years or so that have related to excessive driver hours. It is an issue that I regard as one of the upmost importance and I am pleased to see that the NRTC has also given it a very high priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context I just wanted to give an example that was drawn to my attention only yesterday to illustrate just how serious this issue is and how difficult it is for ordinary truck drivers to escape the pressures that put them in a position where they are forced to work ridiculously long hours and to ultimately become a danger because of fatigue, not only to themselves, but also to other road users. In some instances they end up being forced to use drugs and this ultimately increases the level of danger that is already existing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The example I would like to cite concerns a South Australian company, quite a substantial company. A driver has regularly been doing three round trips Adelaide to Sydney per week, which is, of course, a pretty lengthy trip. On top of that he has to do a range of things associated with routine maintenance, loading, unloading, refuelling, and all of those sorts of things. He is working regularly in excess of 90 hours a week, the vast bulk of which is on the road driving a potentially lethal piece of equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular driver was on the way back into Adelaide only very recently when he stopped at a weighbridge, showed his logbook and indicated that he had clearly been breaching driving hours regulations. As a result of that his company was telephoned and he was instructed on the spot that he was dismissed. He was told that he should have taken a back route to avoid the weighbridge, that he was to take his rig and leave it at a nearby BP service station, and that it was his own problem as to how he then got home. There was instant dismissal because he had advised the regulators, or effectively the enforcers of regulations, that he had breached the regulations. This was not by some fly&hyphen;by&hyphen;night tiny company either; this was a substantial and quite well&hyphen;known road transport operator in Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is that sort of problem that is quite widespread. It is those sorts of pressures that force good honest working Australians to break the law in order to be able to work. As a driver, he is being offered two alternatives: he breaks the law or he does not have a job. That is the reality for a lot of drivers and that is why it is of fundamental importance for regulators, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9011"> politicians and organisations like the NRTC to ensure that everything possible is done to minimise this sort of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is probably impossible to stamp it out completely, because it is difficult to regulate, but we have to place maximum priority and emphasis on eradicating this sort of behaviour by companies and contractors. In that context, not only do I applaud the NRTC but also I am very pleased to see that industry organisations&mdash;like the Road Transport Forum, Victorian Road Transport Association and other industry associations&mdash;are treating these issues very seriously. One of the other problems in this area is that, if there is a proliferation of bad operators who break the law, it places the good operators&mdash;the decent companies of which there are many&mdash;at an immense competitive disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already seen the majors like Mayne Nickless, Brambles and TNT gradually exiting from general road transport freight. One of the elements in that change&mdash;by no means the only one&mdash;is the problem of unfair competition faced by those companies by people breaking the law. It is important for the decent parts of the industry that the law is strictly and properly enforced, so that they can actually compete on a level playing field, where competition should exist on efficiency and reliability, not on breaking the law and endangering the lives of their drivers and other citizens on the public highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the industry leaders for the seriousness with which they are approaching this problem and their willingness to address it. It is a very large industry. There are thousands of operators with a very wide range of people involved. It is very difficult to pursue this issue in a way that guarantees that the regulations are fully and comprehensively enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, that is all I have to say on the legislation. As I said, the opposition supports the extension of one year for the life of the NRTC to provide a breathing space in which the various governments can negotiate about the future of the NRTC. My suggestion would be that there is a substantial future for the NRTC, once the bulk of its work developing uniform regulations is completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a substantial future for the NRTC in the enforcement field&mdash;not as a direct enforcer, because that ultimately will remain the territory of the states, but as a facilitator, in the same role that it has had in the regulatory sphere. I see the NRTC having a potentially valuable role as a national facilitator in the enforcement field, working with the various enforcement bodies to ensure that the regulations are properly enforced, to ensure that there is a degree of commonality and consistency across the various jurisdictions, and to ensure that there is a Commonwealth involvement, albeit by consent with the states, in that enforcement process, so that there is enough muscle and public commitment to ensure that the sort of story that I have just recounted with respect to this Adelaide driver becomes a rarity rather than the relatively common experience that it currently is.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to support the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R310">National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . As the previous speaker said, through an amendment to the act the bill will extend the life of the NRTC by one year. There is already a strong feeling that we have moved a great deal of distance in terms of reforms to road transport in Australia, but it is felt that another year is needed to bed down the reforms that are already well in the pipeline and to work out what the best future is for the NRTC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me list some of the most positive reforms that have been forthcoming since the NRTC was formed in 1991. There has been the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Act, which provides the basis for uniform national road rules; the Road Transport Reform (Heavy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9012"> Vehicles Registration) Act, which allows for uniform and consistent registration requirements across the country; and the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act, providing for a safer operating regime for the transport by road of dangerous goods. And driving hours for long&hyphen;distance coaches have been regulated to ensure greater safety for all road users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reforms have been initiated since 1991. They have involved numerous negotiations and consultations between the states and territories and the Commonwealth. Originally it was probably never imagined that such a detailed negotiation was required. But there is further time needed to make sure that the reforms already under way are bedded down and institutional arrangements made are the best for the nation as a whole in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government last year reviewed the achievements, the accomplishments and the functions of the commission. The main findings of the review were accepted in February this year by the Ministerial Council for Road Transport. Commonwealth, state and territory officials are now working to turn the review principles into amendments to the National Road Transport Commission Act, but they also need additional time  to achieve all of these objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, Australia is an enormous continent. Most of the inland communities are effectively only linked by road and are dependent on an efficient network to move their primary production to the ports and manufacturers. And, of course, our cities depend to a very substantial degree on the transport industry to keep their commerce moving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A 1996 report of the Department of Transport and Regional Development, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A national approach to road transport regulation</EMPHASIS>, found that the transport industry dominates freight in Australia, accounting for 75 per cent of the value of the Australian freight market. As part of the report, a survey of road transport companies was carried out. According to the respondents, differing road transport regulations between states and territories in the past had imposed the most substantial and unnecessary costs on the industry and on transport users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report noted that, while substantial administrative changes have resulted from increased national uniformity in Australia's road transport regulatory regime, costs to users of road freight have not significantly dropped. Savings have been invested in better equipment and the need to meet increased costs, for example in fuel. Reforms leading to uniform mass and loading regulations, uniform vehicle standards and better access for B&hyphen;doubles will allow firms greater freedom to select the best driver&hyphen;vehicle combinations for a given task in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">National standards have enabled firms to make more efficient use of their existing fleets by giving them greater freedom to select the most appropriate vehicles. Small firms in particular will be able to have more flexibility in terms of the use of drivers always under a safer regime and, as time goes by, they would expect to see the costs of using road freight reflected in these substantial reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, state and territory borders have to some extent become artificial market boundaries and barriers and they have provided some shelter for intrastate operators compared with those operating interstate. Under a national approach, the artificial disadvantage to interstate operators can be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to Federation the colonies in Australia were each responsible for their transport infrastructure and regulation. The constitution recognised the integrity of the borders between states, but made sure that interstate commerce would always flow freely without taxes or tariffs. It has been the transport regulations that have assisted colonies to maintain some advantages&mdash;one against the other&mdash;over time, and it is up to this nation to make sure that we have in fact genuine free trade flowing between states.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9013">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Responsibility for the development of road transport regulations has rested primarily with state and territory governments, and each has applied a regulatory regime considered best to suit its particular circumstances. One of the great achievements of the National Road Transport Commission has been the bringing together of all of those interests, where they recognise the nation as a whole must be, at the end of the day, the winner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, we still have a long way to go. The additional year that is being identified as the major thrust of this amendment will be the year needed to make sure the states, the territories and the Commonwealth together produce the best regime possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an effort to try to overcome some of the consequences of the interstate parochialism, the federal government, in 1987, introduced the federal interstate registration scheme, or FIRS. FIRS has been restricted in its ability to compete with state registration schemes, however, as FIRS registered vehicles cannot be used to provide intrastate services, while state registered vehicles can be used to provide both inter&hyphen; and intrastate services. That is just one of the anomalies we need to work with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">National Road Transport Commission recommendations are submitted to the Ministerial Council for Road Transport for its approval. Once the council agrees, the onus is on each government to amend its regulations to achieve national consistency. The Commonwealth is responsible for relevant legislation on behalf of the ACT, and for legislation to cover vehicles registered under FIRS. Other governments are then required to adopt substantially the intent and content of the legislation applicable in the ACT as their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of emission and noise standards, these are presently developed by the NRTC in conjunction with state and federal environment ministers. However, while noise and emission standards for new vehicles are controlled through the Australian design rule system administered by the Federal Office of Road Safety, second&hyphen;hand or in&hyphen;service vehicles' noise and emission standards are subject to a template process. In other words, they remain ultimately in the domain of the states and territories&mdash;another example where we still need time to work through anomalies that are not in the best interests of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to remember that much road transport takes place in built&hyphen;up areas with substantial road congestion and population densities. Most road freight trips do not cross a state or territory border, and a high proportion of them are in urban areas. About 80 per cent of all road freight trips are less than 100 kilometres in length; thus this issue of noise abatement and emissions is an example of one of the most important areas where work in reconciling processes still has to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day we need to be sure that the needs of environment protection and of those working in the industry are brought together in a very tight fit. It is not just the environment that stands to gain as we continue the road transport industry reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A 1994 report by the Centre for International Economics estimated that Australia's road transport industry accounts for two per cent of Australia's GDP, and about 2.1 per cent of total employment. This would put the value of road transport at $8.5 billion, employing at least 160,000 people. In l994 the National Transport Planning Task Force found that road transport makes up 73 per cent of the value of Australia's freight market. It showed that the total quantity of freight carried by road increased from 18 per cent in 1975&hyphen;76 to 33 per cent in l990&hyphen;91, and since l975&hyphen;76 the average length of road freight trips has nearly doubled. Clearly, we are dealing with an industry here that is growing in proportion to the enterprise of Australia's businesses, and we have to make sure it is world best and efficient.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9014">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A l995 Industry Commission report calculated that road transport industry reforms would increase Australia's GDP by about $800 million a year, based on the size of the l995 economy. In a l996 survey by the Department of Transport and Regional Development, road freight operators were found to be superior in terms of reliability and service quality compared to other freight operators. They have been doing a good job. It was suggested that on some prime line haul routes such as Melbourne to Sydney, rail needed to become some 20 per cent cheaper to compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The performance of the road freight industry in Australia has also been found to compare well with international best practice. Prices were similar to those charged in the USA, Canada and New Zealand. Vehicle operating costs in Australia were found to be in the middle of the international range for both short and long distance services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Road transport service holds a special place in the economic wellbeing of Australia. The statistics show that the road industry itself is doing its best to be efficient and safe, but it requires Australian state and Commonwealth regulations to ensure that they are working in an environment where the interests of their employees and of the consumers are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already heard from the previous speaker that there are often great difficulties in the pressures drivers face in trying to cover the distances in the times required. There are a great many anomalies still at work in the industry. Let me give you an example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Imagine the frustrations and the safety implications of an interstate trucking business faced with a 13&hyphen;hour trip between Sydney and Brisbane. Under New South Wales regulations still in force, a 14&hyphen;hour shift is legal. That is a shift with one driver driving continuously. Under Queensland law, however, the maximum time he may drive without a break is 12 hours. So the lone driver heading up the road from Sydney to Brisbane drives without a break and exchanges with someone else for the last hour or so of the trip or, indeed, the transport operator employs two people for the duration of the journey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, such anomalies are nonsense. They are not in the interest of an efficient business. Clearly, someone driving a 14&hyphen;hour shift is driving to the limits of their ability to remain at all times at the peak of their efficiency. That sort of shift, obviously, can lead from time to time to endangering others on the road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise we have different road speed limits in New South Wales and Victoria. On the Hume Highway in Victoria, a huge truck can travel up to 100 kilometres per hour. In New South Wales, trucks without 100 kilometres per hour limiters are required to go some 90 kilometres per hour on that same highway where there are single lanes. A truck driving at 90 kilometres an hour on the Hume Highway is a frustration to both a truck driver and a line of cars piled behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to look very carefully still at the reforms that have taken place, but also at the implementation of those reforms. We need to listen very carefully to the industry, many of whom are still saying to us that there are pressures in this industry which make it unsafe on the roads and mean that we are still not getting the best efficiency out of our industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government understands these needs. Today we are putting an amendment before the House which gives another year of service to the National Road Transport Commission. We are trying to ensure that, with our huge opportunities for developing our exports, we are putting in place one of the world's best transport sectors in the sense that they are not impeded in any way with regulations that are inconsistent from one state jurisdiction to the next and are not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9015"> inconsistent with national rules that apply overall. I therefore, very strongly, commend this amendment to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always good to take the opportunity to talk on road&hyphen;related matters with the success that this government has struck in the development of some new road programs across Australia and, more particularly, in our part of the country with the development of the Pacific Highway within the RONI program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill that we are debating today is the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill 1997. The bill extends the operation of the NRTC for another 12 months. I think it is important that the parliament notes, first of all, the manner in which this organisation has been structured financially in that all jurisdictions helped fund the NRTC, with the Commonwealth putting in 35 per cent of the total annual funding of $3.6 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, it bridges the divide across the Commonwealth. The greatest impediments to development and efficiency in this country have always been state borders. At last, as a nation, I can see this country ever so slowly starting to mature in being able to work together in areas such as those that the NRTC have been working with on reforms in the road transport industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that the Industry Commission estimated that gains from reforms to the national road transport industry would provide up to $0.8 billion to GDP. That is a significant amount of money. It is a significant improvement in efficiency in what we do in Australia. It is important that we should look at not only building better roads to improve efficiency and safety and all those other things that we are trying to achieve, but also focus on how an industry is operated and try to do away with a lot of those inefficiencies, which predominantly flow from different regulations in different states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very good to see the work that the NRTC has achieved. I noted in the second reading speech of the former minister, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), that since the NRTC was created in 1991 heavy vehicle charges have been reformed. The speech also notes that the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Act has been passed; that the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Act allows for uniform and consistent registration requirements across the country; that the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act provides for a safer operating regime for the transport by road of dangerous goods; and that driving hours for long distance coaches and for trucks have reached an advanced stage of development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note the comments from the previous speaker, the member for Murray (Mrs Stone), regarding the differences between the states. There have been some great achievements made in this area. In no small way that is due to an increasing commitment between the Commonwealth and the states to improve the processes involved in transport in Australia. I think everybody would be aware of the communique that came out of the national rail summit that the former minister had convened recently in Melbourne, which was another breakthrough as far as a national decision is concerned. It is in line with what I was saying: that this nation is slowly maturing in this area of being able to work together and not having petty jealousies across state borders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just out of interest, and this is something that my committee's inquiry into national road funding has noticed, there are still some parochial views held across Australia with regard to road funding. I came in for a bit of attention around Australia when we were conducting the inquiry because the Pacific Highway just happens to run through my electorate as it goes up 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9016"> the mid north coast. But it should not go unsaid that that particular piece of Australia's transport infrastructure has been screaming out, as have the members that represent the electorates along it, for attention for a lot of years. The Labor Party will jump up and say, `We were going to do it if we had got another term.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was another 14&hyphen;year defence: `In our 14th year, we would have done it, you can be assured about that,' but there was no way that they were going to pay attention to it in the 13 years that they were in government. That is notwithstanding the fact that they held two seats along some of the critical parts of the Pacific Highway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The development of the strategy that the coalition government has with regard to road funding and the attention that is being placed on the national highway system&mdash;and not only on the development of the roads of national importance but also the reintroduction of the black spots program&mdash;have been very important elements of addressing the serious issues of transport in Australia, particularly road transport. It seems that the opposition is going to support this bill, and it was interesting to listen to the comments of the shadow minister, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), in this regard. His comments are certainly welcome and the support of the opposition is welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We look forward to more positive gains during the next 12 months from the NRTC in advancing a national strategy for road transport in this area. Hopefully, in the future, we will see a national strategy&mdash;that is, one agreed to by all states&mdash;with further development of the very important network and infrastructure of roads, no matter what category they fall into across Australia. Until we reach that stage of maturity in attitude between the Commonwealth and the states, particularly coming back from the states, we will not progress it fast enough. We will not achieve the efficiencies that we must achieve to be much more competitive in the world scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the most important thing that can be achieved from a national agreement on a strategy in this regard, as far as the National Road Transport Commission is concerned, and also with a national road strategy, is the efficiency in the expenditure of taxpayers' dollars. It goes without saying that we have seen what can be done with the Pacific Highway program when there is agreement between the Commonwealth and the state of New South Wales to fund that road. New mechanisms are being put into place. One section that is being built at the moment just south of my electorate is being done on a design, construct and maintain basis. The contract that was let came in, I think, somewhere in the vicinity of $60 million cheaper than the RTA's estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a new form of contract where there is a massive contract for 27&hyphen;odd kilometres of brand new dual carriageway highway. The RTA estimated $196,000,000 to do the job and the successful contractor is going to do it for $130,000,000. Those sorts of innovations are what we are really responsible for in this place, making sure that we get the maximum efficiency out of taxpayers' dollars and that in turn will create a much more efficient road transport industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we support this bill and it is important we see the continuation of the very good work that the National Road Transport Commission has achieved so far. I support this bill in extending that for the next 12 months.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R266">Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  was introduced into the House on 26 June 1997. The purpose is the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board and the transfer of the AWB's wheat marketing and financing functions to an AWB wholly owned holding company and its subsidiaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AWB is to retain control over export and marketing of wheat overseas. The AWB is to obtain control over the wheat industry fund, also known as WIF, until the WIF component of the levy on wheat sales is terminated on 30 June 1997. The AWB is to be treated as an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9018"> agent of nominated companies in respect of new season wheat transactions in the season beginning on or after 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wheat industry of Australia is one of the great historic industries, with $3 billion worth of exports. Therefore, as we would all know and understand, it is inextricably linked to the history of the country. It has a long history of government intervention, beginning in 1915, with the Wheat Board established as a wartime measure and the breaking of the collusive wheat merchants' control. In the 1930s, the Great Depression led to the government direction of wheat production levels. The Senate and states remained barriers to legislative direction. Finally, in November 1931, the wheat bounty was passed by the parliament and there was recognition of both Commonwealth and state interest. I would add that there is still evidence right back to those times, right across Australia I would imagine, of the impact on land use and land tenure of the management of the wheat industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1948, the Labor government introduced guaranteed prices, a home consumption price, the Australian Wheat Board&mdash;as we have come to know it&mdash;and stabilisation arrangements. Between 1948 and 1984, there were a series of wheat plans based on these basic concepts. From 1979 to 1983, there were calls for reform from the High Court, the Senate, the Auditor&hyphen;General and the Industries Assistance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all of that, the balance was for the growers, who by and large were small business operators, against the power&mdash;as was noted in 1915&mdash;of the merchants and the world traders. So the Wheat Board has shown a great resilience and ability to adapt, and, as much as any other contribution by any other organisation, has given a stability and strength to regional Australia, for which, as a former wheat grower, and going back as far as my grandparents, I have been extremely grateful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1984 Wheat Marketing Act introduced a system of permits for wheat used for stock feed, where producers and consumers could trade directly but under guidelines and regulations; alterations to the guaranteed minimum price arrangements which sent increased market signals to producers; and five separate categories for wheat for which prices were underwritten, as against one category previously, to reduce the cross&hyphen;subsidisation and allow a stronger market focus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1986&hyphen;87, a period I remember very well, the McColl royal commission into grain storage, handling and transport recommended a number of improvements including: marketing authorities to deal with a deregulated distribution system; removal of the requirement that market authorities grant sole receival rights to the state agencies for storage and handling; and removal of all restrictions and impediments for the transport of grain by road. There was a well&hyphen;known phrase, the least cost path, because before that we had a range of impediments related to the history and development of the road&hyphen;rail industry. The commission also recommended a disaggregation of port service and sea transport costs, with charges to growers and other users to reflect actual port costs&mdash;that is, reforms to allow charges for port and shipping services to more closely reflect actual costs incurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1988, we had the IAC wheat industry report, which recommended: limiting the AWB's power to control exports to prescribed markets; extending the grower&hyphen;to&hyphen;buyer and permit arrangements to export sales; extending permit arrangements to cover all domestic sales, with no restraints on reselling in the domestic market&mdash;and there was great debate on that issue at the time; the AWB's obligation to supply the domestic market; discontinuation of the administrative domestic pricing mechanism; discontinuation of underwriting provisions; and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9019"> advance payments to be a declared proportion of the season's expected market returns, with the option of negotiable certificates in lieu. Finally, the IAC wheat industry report recommended that, as far as practicable, individual payments to growers were to reflect actual market returns and associated costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1989, we had further government reform and deregulation, no doubt contributed to by the previous IAC report. There was deregulation of the domestic wheat market through the removal of the AWB's compulsory acquisition powers and termination of administered domestic pricing arrangements. There was the introduction of a fixed government guarantee on AWB borrowings in relation to pool wheat for advance payments, payments in lieu of final payments and operational expenses associated with sales where the AWB's borrowing liability exceeded money available for repayment of the borrowing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further in that particular development we have the removal of the requirements that there be a majority of growers among board members. I remember the angst in the industry at that time and there was a feeling, perhaps, of loss of control by members. But the philosophy, I think, has been proven to be sound and right in that the industry and the government of the day brought in the expertise&mdash;in marketing, quality control: a whole range of different expertise&mdash;other than just that of the growers, as important as that is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was the establishment of the wheat industry fund. We have funded that principally from a minimum two per cent grower levy to generate a capital base for financing the AWB's marketing activities. And finally, there is the AWB objective of maximising net returns to producers by minimising storage handling and transport costs, with costs to be passed back to individual growers where possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation delivers control back to the growers as requested by the grains industry, and from 1 July 1999 wheat marketing will be undertaken by a grower controlled and run company. The new company will comprise a holding company with two subsidiaries, pooling and domestic trading. There will be A&hyphen;class and B&hyphen;class shares and the organisation of that was set down in the speech of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). Transitional provisions will apply until 30 June 1999. There will be the cessation of the WIF levy and, of course, there is the issue of the composition of the board of the AWB.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion may I just put on record my appreciation of the industry's effort in coming to terms with the emerging competition policy and striking the balance between the stability that is so important out there for the wheat industry in regional Australia, and that which has to be market focused. In respect of those original pioneers who saw the importance of the AWB, I am sure they would be appreciative of the strength of the new arrangements adapting to the 21st century. Thank you.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) No. Neither the Government nor the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) is planning the construction of a fourth runway at Jandakot Airport at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) A draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was prepared in 1992 in connection with the FAC's Proposed Additional Developments at Jandakot Airport. The FAC considered a range of future aviation and non&hyphen;aviation development initiatives for the Airport, including construction of a fourth runway from about the year 2010 should future demand warrant such investment. Following release of the draft EIS, the then Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency (now Environment Australia) requested that further studies be carried out in relation to aircraft noise around Jandakot Airport. The FAC proposes to prepare a supplement to the draft EIS following completion of the Jandakot Airport Noise Study which is currently underway. However, as indicated in response to (1) 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> above, there are no plans for the construction of a fourth runway at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The airport site comprising 618 hectares, together with existing infrastructure and commercial business, will be offered for sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Government does not anticipate binding the new owner through a specific contractual clause to address noise problems. The new owner will be required to observe all laws that apply to the Airport (be they Commonwealth, State or municipal laws). In this context, the Commonwealth will require the new owner to obtain and maintain the necessary licences and approvals to operate the aerodrome and ensure that all air traffic and navigation service obligations are met in accordance with applicable legislation and regulations (including Air Services Regulations).</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="9022" SPEAKER="Ruddock, Philip, MP" NAMEID="0J4" ELECTORATE="Berowra" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Immigration and Multicultural Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr Ruddock</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) To be eligible for Newstart Allowance a customer must firstly be unemployed. A person who is substantially involved in running a business would not normally be regarded as unemployed. An exception to this is where the business is on a small scale and designed to be a supplement rather than an alternative to wages and is compatible with taking a full&hyphen;time job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where it is determined that a person is unemployed for the purpose of meeting the eligibility requirements for Newstart Allowance, they must also satisfy a set of requirements known as the activity test. A major requirement of the activity test is that a person must be actively searching for and willing to undertake any suitable paid work. A self&hyphen;employed person generally must meet this job search requirement, including not refusing an offer of employment because it interferes with their business. Sub&hyphen;contractors or other self&hyphen;employed people, who hire themselves and/or their plant or equipment out for particular jobs, may be regarded as unemployed when out of work but they too must meet the above tests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In certain circumstances, the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) may approve the development of self employment opportunities as an activity which satisfies activity test requirements and Newstart Allowance can be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The provision of work for another person would not in itself disqualify a person from receiving Newstart Allowance. However, it is unlikely that a sole trader in these circumstances would be considered to be unemployed or be able to satisfy the activity test requirements. If, for example, a sub&hyphen;contractor obtains some casual work, he or she would not be disqualified from payment on the basis that they employed another person. Where the work was of a casual nature, they would be treated in a similar manner to other casual workers and would generally remain qualified for payment, subject to the income test. Self&hyphen;employed people earning income may receive reduced payments or no payments at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Newstart Allowance provides income support to unemployed people who are looking for work or who are engaged in other labour market related activities. There is no anomaly in denying an unemployment payment to someone who is not unemployed. People who have been on Newstart Allowance for at least 6 months can undertake self employment development (SED) as part of their activity agreement. SED can be approved as part of a person's activity agreement where the CES is satisfied that the business will be commercially viable within 12 months of commencement and it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is likely to provide the person with full&hyphen;time employment at a level of income at least equivalent to the rate of Newstart Allowance. The approval is intended to be for the developmental stage only and it is expected that once the business commences, income support will cease and healthy, fair competition will prevail. In addition, the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS), administered by the CES, provides income support for up to 12 months to people setting up and running businesses, as well as training in business management.</PARA>
